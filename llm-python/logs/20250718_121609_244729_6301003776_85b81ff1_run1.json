          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's take a look at each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 13x14 grid. The output is also 13x14. Looking at the input and output, maybe there's some kind of pattern where certain positions are changed based on their coordinates. Let me check the first row of input and output. The input first row is all 6s and 0s in a pattern. The output first row is similar but maybe some changes. Wait, looking at the first row of input and output:\n\nInput row 0: 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\nOutput row 0: 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\nSo it's the same. But looking at the second row of input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0\nOutput row 1: 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6\nHmm, the output row 1 has some changes. The fourth element in input is 6, but in output it's 6. Then the fifth element is 6 in input, but in output it's 0. Wait, maybe there's a pattern based on the position. Let me check the positions where the 0s are. Maybe the transformation is about flipping certain positions based on their row and column indices.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input and output have similar structures. For example, the first row of input and output are the same. But the second row of input is 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 7, and the output is 7 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 7 7. So the second row of input has some 0s in positions 1,2,4,5, etc. The output seems to have some changes in the middle. Maybe the transformation is about flipping certain positions based on even or odd rows or columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry. For instance, in Example 1, the output seems to have some changes in certain positions. Let me check the third row of input and output. Input row 2 is 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6. Output row 2 is same as input. So maybe the transformation isn't changing some rows. But in other rows, like row 3, input is 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0. Output is 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0. Wait, but in Example 1, the output row 3 is 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0. Wait, but in the input row 3, the 7th element (index 6?) is 6, and in output it's 6. Maybe not. Wait, maybe the pattern is more about certain positions being flipped based on their coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of parity. For example, if the row index is even or odd, or column index is even or odd. Let's think about Example 1's output row 1. The input row 1 is 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0. The output row 1 is 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6. Comparing the input and output, the fifth element (index 4) in input is 6, but in output it's 0. The sixth element (index 5) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. Then the seventh element (index 6) is 6 in input, and 6 in output. The eighth element (index 7) is 6 in input, but in output it's 6. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the value is changed based on the row and column. For example, maybe when the row is odd, certain columns are flipped.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3. The input and output have some changes. Let's check the second row of input and output. Input row 1 is 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1. Output row 1 is 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1. So the fifth element (index 4) in input is 1, but in output it's 0. The sixth element (index 5) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The seventh element (index 6) is 1 in input, but in output it's 1. The eighth element (index 7) is 0 in input, but in output it's 1. The ninth element (index 8) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The tenth element (index 9) is 1 in input, but in output it's 1. The eleventh element (index 10) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The twelfth element (index 11) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The thirteenth element (index 12) is 1 in input, but in output it's 1. Hmm. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of checkerboard pattern. For example, if the sum of row and column is even or odd. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row of output has some changes. Let me think about the positions where the 0s are. For example, in the input row 1, the 4th element (index 3) is 6, but in output it's 6. The fifth element (index 4) is 6 in input, but in output it's 0. The sixth element (index 5) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. Then the seventh element (index 6) is 6 in input, but in output it's 6. The eighth element (index 7) is 6 in input, but in output it's 6. The ninth element (index 8) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The tenth element (index 9) is 6 in input, but in output it's 6. The eleventh element (index 10) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The twelfth element (index 11) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The thirteenth element (index 12) is 6 in input, but in output it's 6. The fourteenth element (index 13) is 0 in input, but in output it's 6. So that's a change in the last element. Wait, but that seems inconsistent. Maybe there's a pattern based on row and column parity.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row's output is 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6. Comparing to the input row 1: 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0. So the fifth element (index 4) in input is 6, but in output it's 0. The sixth element (index 5) is 0 in input, same as output. The seventh element (index 6) is 6 in input, same as output. The eighth element (index 7) is 6 in input, but in output it's 6. The ninth element (index 8) is 0 in input, same as output. The tenth element (index 9) is 6 in input, same as output. The eleventh element (index 10) is 0 in input, same as output. The twelfth element (index 11) is 0 in input, same as output. The thirteenth element (index 12) is 6 in input, same as output. The fourteenth element (index 13) is 0 in input, but in output it's 6. So that's a change. So why is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, in even rows, certain positions are changed. Or maybe for rows where the row index is odd, certain columns are modified. For example, in row 1 (which is the second row, since rows start at 0?), maybe columns 4 and 5 are modified. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of rotation or reflection. For example, in Example 1, the output row 1 seems to have some changes. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input and output have similar patterns. Let me check the second row. Input row 1 is 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 7. Output row 1 is 7 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 7 7. So the first element (index 0) is 7 in input and output. The second element (index 1) is 7 in input, but in output it's 0. The third element (index 2) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The fourth element (index 3) is 7 in input, but in output it's 7. The fifth element (index 4) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The sixth element (index 5) is 0 in input, same as output. The seventh element (index 6) is 7 in input, same as output. The eighth element (index 7) is 7 in input, same as output. The ninth element (index 8) is 0 in input, same as output. The tenth element (index 9) is 7 in input, but in output it's 7. The eleventh element (index 10) is 0 in input, but in output it's 7. The twelfth element (index 11) is 0 in input, same as output. The thirteenth element (index 12) is 7 in input, same as output. The fourteenth element (index 13) is 7 in input, same as output. So the second element (index 1) is changed from 7 to 0, and the eleventh element (index 10) is changed from 0 to 7. That seems like a pattern where certain positions are flipped based on their column indices. For example, in row 1, columns 1 and 10 are changed. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of parity. For example, if the column index is even or odd. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output. The second row of input is 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1. The output row is 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1. So the fifth element (index 4) is 1 in input, but in output it's 0. The seventh element (index 6) is 1 in input, but in output it's 1. The eighth element (index 7) is 0 in input, but in output it's 1. The ninth element (index 8) is 0 in input, same as output. The tenth element (index 9) is 1 in input, same as output. The eleventh element (index 10) is 0 in input, same as output. The twelfth element (index 11) is 0 in input, same as output. The thirteenth element (index 12) is 1 in input, same as output. So maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the value is changed based on row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even or odd, and the column is even or odd. For instance, in Example 1, the second row (row index 1) is odd. In that row, maybe certain columns are flipped. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of all examples, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are flipped based on their position. For example, in Example 1's output, row 1 (second row) has the fifth element (index 4) changed from 6 to 0. In Example 2's output, row 1 (second row) has the second element (index 1) changed from 7 to 0 and the eleventh (index 10) changed from 0 to 7. In Example 3's output, row 1 (second row) has the fifth element (index 4) changed from 1 to 0 and the eighth (index 7) changed from 0 to 1. \n\nThis seems like there's a pattern where in certain positions, the value is flipped based on the row and column. For example, maybe in even rows, certain columns are flipped, and in odd rows, others. Or maybe the pattern is that for rows where the row index is even or odd, certain columns are modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain columns are flipped based on their position. For example, in row i, if i is even, then certain columns are changed. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern in the output compared to the input. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 1 (second row) has the fifth element (index 4) changed from 6 to 0. In Example 2, the same row has the second element (index 1) changed from 7 to 0 and the eleventh (index 10) from 0 to 7. In Example 3, the same row has fifth element (index 4) changed from 1 to 0 and eighth (index 7) from 0 to 1. \n\nThis seems like the pattern is that in row i, for certain columns, the value is flipped. For example, maybe in row i, the columns that are in certain positions (like column 4 and 5, or 1 and 10) are flipped. But how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in each row, the elements at positions where (row + column) is even or odd are changed. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1's row 1, the fifth element (index 4) is 0. In the input, that was 6. The sixth element (index 5) was 0. The seventh element (index 6) was 6. The eighth element (index 7) was 6. The ninth element (index 8) was 0. The tenth element (index 9) was 6. The eleventh element (index 10) was 0. The twelfth element (index 11) was 0. The thirteenth element (index 12) was 6. The fourteenth element (index 13) was 0. In the output, the fifth element (index 4) is 0, the eighth element (index 7) is 6, the fourteenth element (index 13) is 6. So maybe the pattern is that in row 1 (odd row), certain columns are changed. For example, columns 4 and 5 (indices 4 and 5) are changed. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the elements in even columns are kept, and odd columns are flipped. Or something like that. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row has the fifth element (index 4) changed from 6 to 0. Let me check if that index is even or odd. Index 4 is even. But the original value was 6, and the output is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, in even rows, certain columns are modified. Let's think about the examples. For example, in Example 1, the first row (row 0) is the same as input. The second row (row 1) has some changes. The third row (row 2) is the same as input. Fourth row (row 3) has changes. So maybe the transformation is applied to certain rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, row 1 (second row) has some changes. Maybe the pattern is that for rows where the row index is odd, certain columns are modified. For example, in row 1, columns 4 and 5 are modified. In row 3, maybe columns 4 and 5 are modified again. But how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the column indices. For example, in columns where the column index is even or odd. For example, in column 4 (index 4), which is even, maybe some changes are made. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the parity of the row and column. For example, if the row is odd and column is even, then the value is changed. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of all examples, maybe the transformation is that for certain positions, the value is flipped. For example, in the input, if the row is even, then certain columns are flipped. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if (i + j) is even, then it's kept, else it's flipped. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1's output, the second row (row 1) has the fifth element (index 4) changed from 6 to 0. The sum i + j is 1 + 4 = 5, which is odd. So maybe for cells where i + j is odd, the value is changed. But this is just a hypothesis. Let's check other cells in that row. For example, the seventh element (index 6) is 6 in input, and 6 in output. i + j is 1 + 6 = 7, which is odd. But the value is not changed. So that hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row parity. For example, in odd rows, certain columns are changed. For example, in row 1 (odd), columns 4 and 5 are changed. In row 3 (odd), columns 4 and 5 are changed again. But how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, row 1 (second row) has the fifth element (index 4) changed from 6 to 0. The sixth element (index 5) is 0 in input and 0 in output. The eighth element (index 7) is 6 in input and 6 in output. The twelfth element (index 11) is 0 in input and 0 in output. The fourteenth element (index 13) is 0 in input and 6 in output. So that's a change in index 13. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the elements in even positions are kept, and odd positions are flipped. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of all examples, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then it's kept as is, but if i is odd, then some columns are flipped. For example, in Example 1's row 1 (odd), columns 4 and 5 are flipped. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the elements in positions where column is even are flipped. For example, in row 1, columns 0, 2, 4, 6, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the elements at positions where column is even are flipped. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3's row 1, the fifth element (index 4) is 0, which is a change. The eighth element (index 7) is 1, which is a change. So maybe for row 1 (odd), columns 4 and 7 are changed. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in each row, the elements at positions where column is divisible by 4 are changed. For example, in row 1, column 4 is 4, which is divisible by 4. So maybe that's a pattern. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, in row i and column j, if (i + j) is even, then the value is flipped. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of all examples, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if the row index is odd, then the value is flipped if the column index is even. For example, in Example 1's row 1 (odd), columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 are even. But in the output, some of these columns are changed. For example, column 4 (index 4) is changed from 6 to 0. Column 0 is 6 in input and output. Column 2 is 0 in input and output. Column 6 is 6 in input and output. Column 8 is 0 in input and output. Column 10 is 0 in input and output. Column 12 is 6 in input and output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row i, the cells in columns j where j is even are flipped if i is odd. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look at the outputs of all examples and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nLooking at Example 1 and 2, the output seems to have some changes in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the second row has changes in certain columns. In Example 2, the second row has changes in columns 1 and 10. In Example 3, the second row has changes in columns 4 and 7. In Example 4, the second row has changes in columns 4 and 7. \n\nWait, looking at Example 4's input and output. Input row 1 is 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0. Output row 1 is 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0. So the seventh element (index 6) is 1 in input, but in output it's 1. The eighth element (index 7) is 1 in input, but in output it's 0. The ninth element (index 8) is 0 in input, same as output. The tenth element (index 9) is 1 in input, same as output. The eleventh element (index 10) is 0 in input, same as output. The twelfth element (index 11) is 0 in input, same as output. The thirteenth element (index 12) is 1 in input, same as output. The fourteenth element (index 13) is 0 in input, same as output. So in this case, the eighth element (index 7) is changed from 1 to 0. \n\nThis suggests that in row 1 (odd), the eighth column (index 7) is changed. But why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row i, the cells in columns j where j is even are flipped if i is odd. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row i, the cells in columns j where j is even are flipped if i is odd. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1, row 1 (i=1, odd). Columns j=0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 are even. Let's check if these columns are changed. In row 1 of Example 1, the input is 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0. The output is 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6. \n\nSo for j=0 (even), value is 6 in input and output. j=2 (even) is 0 in input and output. j=4 (even) is 6 in input, but in output it's 0. j=6 (even) is 6 in input, same as output. j=8 (even) is 0 in input and output. j=10 (even) is 0 in input and output. j=12 (even) is 6 in input and output. So only j=4 is changed. So this hypothesis is not fully correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for odd rows, certain columns are changed based on their position. For example, in row i, columns j where j is 4 and 5 are changed. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row i, the cells at positions j where (i + j) is odd are flipped. Let's test this for Example 1's row 1 (i=1). For j=0: 1+0=1 (odd) \u2192 flipped. In input, j=0 is 6. In output, it's 6. So no change. j=1: 1+1=2 (even) \u2192 not flipped. Input j=1 is 0, output j=1 is 0. j=2: 1+2=3 (odd) \u2192 flipped. Input j=2 is 0, output j=2 is 0. j=3: 1+3=4 (even) \u2192 no change. Input j=3 is 6, output j=3 is 6. j=4: 1+4=5 (odd) \u2192 flipped. Input j=4 is 6 \u2192 output is 0. j=5: 1+5=6 (even) \u2192 no change. Input j=5 is 0 \u2192 output is 0. j=6: 1+6=7 (odd) \u2192 flipped. Input j=6 is 6 \u2192 output is 6. j=7: 1+7=8 (even) \u2192 no change. Input j=7 is 6 \u2192 output is 6. j=8: 1+8=9 (odd) \u2192 flipped. Input j=8 is 0 \u2192 output is 0. j=9: 1+9=10 (even) \u2192 no change. Input j=9 is 6 \u2192 output is 6. j=10: 1+10=11 (odd) \u2192 flipped. Input j=10 is 0 \u2192 output is 0. j=11: 1+11=12 (even) \u2192 no change. Input j=11 is 0 \u2192 output is 0. j=12: 1+12=13 (odd) \u2192 flipped. Input j=12 is 6 \u2192 output is 6. j=13: 1+13=14 (even) \u2192 no change. Input j=13 is 0 \u2192 output is 6. \n\nSo this hypothesis would predict that in row 1, j=4, j=6, j=8, j=10, j=12 are flipped. But in the actual output, only j=4 and j=13 are changed. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Maybe I should think of a different approach. Perhaps the pattern is that in certain rows, certain columns are flipped based on their position. For example, in row 1 (second row), columns 4 and 5 are flipped. But why?\n\nLooking at the outputs of all examples, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the elements at columns 4 and 5 are flipped. But this is just a guess. For example, in Example 1, row 1, column 4 is changed from 6 to 0. Column 5 is 0 in input and output. In Example 2, row 1, column 1 is changed from 7 to 0 and column 10 is changed from 0 to 7. In Example 3, row 1, column 4 is changed from 1 to 0 and column 7 is changed from 0 to 1. In Example 4, row 1, column 7 is changed from 1 to 0. \n\nThis seems inconsistent. Perhaps the pattern is that for each row, certain columns are flipped based on their position. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if the row is odd and column is even, then the value is flipped. But in Example 1's row 1, columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 are even. Only column 4 is changed. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in even rows, certain columns are flipped. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Since the output is always 13x14, perhaps the transformation is based on some kind of pattern that affects certain rows or columns in a specific way.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, I notice that in some cases, the output is similar to the input but with certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output row 1 has some changes, but the other rows are the same. In Example 2, the output row 1 has changes. In Example 3, the output row 1 has changes. In Example 4, the output row 1 has changes. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each row, certain columns are flipped based on their position. For example, in row i, if i is odd, then the columns at positions 4 and 5 are flipped. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions where (column index) is even are flipped if the row is odd. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 4 and 5 are flipped. But in Example 1, row 1 (odd), column 4 is changed from 6 to 0, and column 5 is 0 in input and output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in row i, the columns at positions (i + 4) % 14 are flipped. But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I have. Let's look at the test input and see what the output should be. The test input is:\n\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n\nThe output for this test input is not given, but the task is to write the transformation function. So I need to find a pattern that works for the training examples.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the outputs of the training examples. For example, in Example 1, the output row 1 has some changes. Let's compare the input and output for that row.\n\nInput row 1: 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0\nOutput row 1: 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6\n\nThe changes are at positions 4 (from 6 to 0), 13 (from 0 to 6). \n\nIn Example 2, input row 1: 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 7\nOutput row 1: 7 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 7 7\n\nChanges are at positions 1 (7 to 0), 10 (0 to 7).\n\nIn Example 3, input row 1: 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1\nOutput row 1: 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1\n\nChanges are at positions 4 (1 to 0), 7 (0 to 1).\n\nIn Example 4, input row 1: 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\nOutput row 1: 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0\n\nChange at position 7 (1 to 0).\n\nLooking at these changes, it seems that in the second row (row 1), the changes are at positions that are 4 and 7 (in Example 3 and 4), 1 and 10 (Example 2), and 4 and 13 (Example 1). This is not consistent, but perhaps there's a pattern based on the row index.\n\nFor example, in row 1 (i=1), the changed positions are at j=4, j=7, j=10, j=13. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j where j = (i + 4) % 14 are changed. For example, in row 1, i=1, j=5 (1+4=5). But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for row i, the columns j where j is even are changed. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the changes in row 1 of the examples:\n\nExample 1: j=4 and j=13\nExample 2: j=1 and j=10\nExample 3: j=4 and j=7\nExample 4: j=7\n\nThis seems like the pattern is not consistent, but maybe it's related to the row index. For example, in row 1, the changes are at j=4 (which is 4), j=7 (7), j=10 (10), j=13 (13). These are positions that are 4, 7, 10, 13. These are positions where j is 4 mod 3 = 1, 7 mod 3 = 1, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j where j is 4 + (i * 3) mod 14 are changed. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in row i, the columns j where j is (i + 4) mod 14 are changed. For example, in row 1, j=5. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Maybe I should think of another approach. Perhaps the transformation is based on the row and column indices in a way that for each cell (i,j), if (i + j) is even, then it's kept, else it's flipped. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if i is odd, then the value is flipped if j is even. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's row 1 (i=1, odd), columns j=0,2,4,6,8,10,12 are even. Let's check if these are flipped.\n\nInput row 1: [6,0,0,6,6,0,6,6,0,6,0,0,6,0]\n\nOutput row 1: [6,0,0,6,0,0,6,6,0,6,0,0,6,6]\n\nSo for j=0 (even), value is 6 \u2192 6 (no change). j=2 (even), value is 0 \u2192 0 (no change). j=4 (even), value is 6 \u2192 0 (changed). j=6 (even), value is 6 \u2192 6 (no change). j=8 (even), value is 0 \u2192 0 (no change). j=10 (even), value is 0 \u2192 0 (no change). j=12 (even), value is 6 \u2192 6 (no change). So only j=4 is changed. This fits part of the pattern.\n\nIn Example 2's row 1 (i=1, odd), columns j=0,2,4,6,8,10,12 are even. Let's check.\n\nInput row 1: [7,7,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,7,7]\n\nOutput row 1: [7,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7]\n\nFor j=0 (even): 7 \u2192 7 (no change). j=2 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change). j=4 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change). j=6 (even): 7 \u2192 7 (no change). j=8 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change). j=10 (even): 0 \u2192 7 (changed). j=12 (even): 7 \u2192 7 (no change). So only j=10 is changed. But in the example, j=1 and j=10 are changed. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nBut in this case, j=1 is odd, so it's not part of the even columns. So this suggests that the pattern is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern that involves flipping certain positions based on their row and column indices. For example, in the training examples, the output seems to have changes in certain positions that are related to the row and column indices. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is to flip the value in certain positions based on whether the row is even or odd. For example, in even rows, certain columns are flipped, and in odd rows, other columns are flipped. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to flip the value in positions where the column is even if the row is odd. Let's test this for Example 1's row 1 (odd), columns j=0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. \n\nIn Example 1's row 1, j=4 is changed from 6 to 0. j=12 is 6 in input and output. So this suggests that this is a possible pattern, but it's not clear why only j=4 is changed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j where j is (i * 2) mod 14 are flipped. For example, in row 1, i=1, j=2. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j where j is (i + 4) mod 14 are flipped. For example, in row 1, j=5. But in Example 1's row 1, j=4 is changed. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I have, even if it's not perfect. Let's look at the output of the training examples and try to find a pattern that can be implemented.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the second row has changes in positions 4 and 13. Example 2's second row has changes in positions 1 and 10. Example 3's second row has changes in positions 4 and 7. Example 4's second row has a change in position 7. This suggests that the pattern is not consistent, but perhaps it's related to the row index and column index.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the second row (i=1) has changes in columns that are 4, 7, 10, 13. These are positions that are 4, 7, 10, 13, which are 4 + 3k. For example, 4, 7 (4+3), 10 (7+3), 13 (10+3). But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j where j is (i + 4) mod 14 are changed. For example, in row 1, j=5. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j where j is (i * 3) mod 14 are changed. For example, in row 1, 1*3=3, so j=3. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Perhaps the transformation is based on some kind of rotation or reflection. For example, the output might be a rotated version of the input. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll try to make a hypothesis based on the examples. For example, in the second row (i=1), the changes are in columns that are 4, 7, 10, 13. These are positions that are 4 + 3k. For example, 4, 7 (4+3), 10 (7+3), 13 (10+3). So for row i=1, the columns are 4, 7, 10, 13. This suggests that for row i, the columns j = 4 + 3k, where k is 0, 1, 2, 3. But why?\n\nIf this is the case, then for each row i, the columns j = 4 + 3k are changed. But how to determine k?\n\nAlternatively, for each row i, the columns j = 4 + 3k, where k is such that j is within 0-13. For example, for row i=1, j=4,7,10,13. For row i=3, j=4,7,10,13. But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each row i, the columns j=4,7,10,13 are changed. But how to determine the value to change?\n\nIn Example 1's row 1, j=4 is changed from 6 to 0, and j=13 is changed from 0 to 6. In Example 2's row 1, j=1 is changed from 7 to 0 and j=10 is changed from 0 to 7. This doesn't fit the pattern of j=4,7,10,13.\n\nThis suggests that this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is to flip the value in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, for each cell (i,j), if i is odd and j is even, then flip the value. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to flip the value in positions where (i + j) is even. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: for each cell (i,j), if the row is odd, then flip the value if the column is even. This is a guess, but let's see if it fits the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's row 1 (i=1, odd), columns j=0,2,4,6,8,10,12 are even. Let's check:\n\nInput row 1: [6,0,0,6,6,0,6,6,0,6,0,0,6,0]\n\nOutput row 1: [6,0,0,6,0,0,6,6,0,6,0,0,6,6]\n\nFor j=0 (even): 6 \u2192 6 (no change).\nj=2 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change).\nj=4 (even): 6 \u2192 0 (changed).\nj=6 (even): 6 \u2192 6 (no change).\nj=8 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change).\nj=10 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change).\nj=12 (even): 6 \u2192 6 (no change).\n\nSo only j=4 is changed. This fits part of the pattern.\n\nFor Example 2's row 1 (i=1, odd), columns j=0,2,4,6,8,10,12 are even. Input row 1 is [7,7,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,7,7]. Output is [7,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7].\n\nFor j=0 (even): 7 \u2192 7 (no change).\nj=2 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change).\nj=4 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change).\nj=6 (even): 7 \u2192 7 (no change).\nj=8 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change).\nj=10 (even): 0 \u2192 7 (changed).\nj=12 (even): 7 \u2192 7 (no change).\n\nSo only j=10 is changed. But in the example, j=1 and j=10 are changed. This suggests that this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nBut in this case, j=1 is odd, so it's not part of the even columns. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nGiven that, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Perhaps the transformation is to flip the value in certain positions based on the row and column indices, but I'm not able to determine the exact pattern.\n\nAt this point, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the examples, it seems that in certain rows, certain columns are flipped. For example, in row 1, columns 4 and 13 are flipped in Example 1. In Example 2, columns 1 and 10 are flipped. In Example 3, columns 4 and 7 are flipped. In Example 4, column 7 is flipped.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j = (i + 4) mod 14 and j = (i + 7) mod 14 are flipped. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j = (i * 3) mod 14 and j = (i * 3 + 4) mod 14 are flipped. But this is also a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: for each cell (i,j), if the row is odd, then the value is flipped if j is 4 or 7. This is a guess, but let's see.\n\nIn Example 1's row 1, j=4 and j=7 are 4 and 7. In the input, j=4 is 6, which is flipped to 0. j=7 is 6, which is not changed in the output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for row i, the columns j = i + 4 and j = i + 7 are flipped. For example, in row 1, j=5 and j=8. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with a possible pattern that is based on the row being odd and certain columns being flipped. For example, in odd rows, flip the value at column 4 and 7. This is a guess, but let's code it and see.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row i in 0-12:\n    for each column j in 0-13:\n        if i is odd:\n            if j == 4 or j == 7:\n                flip the value (0 becomes 6, 6 becomes 0, etc.)\n        else:\n            leave as is.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1's row 1 (i=1, odd):\nj=4: 6 \u2192 0 (correct)\nj=7: 6 \u2192 6 (no change, but in the output it's 6. So this is correct.\n\nBut in the output, j=13 is changed from 0 to 6. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in odd rows, columns 4, 7, 10, 13 are flipped.\n\nFor Example 1's row 1, j=4,7,10,13.\n\nInput j=4: 6 \u2192 0 (correct)\nj=7: 6 \u2192 6 (no change)\nj=10: 0 \u2192 0 (no change)\nj=13: 0 \u2192 6 (correct)\n\nSo this would fit. But why?\n\nThis suggests that for odd rows, columns 4,7,10,13 are flipped. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 2's row 1 (i=1, odd):\n\nj=4: 0 \u2192 0 (no change)\nj=7: 7 \u2192 7 (no change)\nj=10: 0 \u2192 7 (correct)\nj=13: 7 \u2192 7 (no change)\n\nBut in the example, j=1 is also changed. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output row 1 has changes at j=1 and j=10. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with the hypothesis that for each row i, the columns j=4,7,10,13 are flipped if the row is odd. This is a guess, but it fits some examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if i % 2 == 1:  # odd row\n                if j in [4,7,10,13]:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6 if transformed[i][j] == 0 else 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is a guess. Let's test it against the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's row 1, this would change j=4,7,10,13. In the input, j=4 is 6 \u2192 0, j=7 is 6 \u2192 0, but in the output it's 6. So this is incorrect.\n\nSo this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nGiven that, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Perhaps the transformation is based on some other pattern, like flipping certain positions based on the row and column indices.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the pattern is that in each row, the value at column 4 is flipped, and the value at column 7 is flipped. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example 1's row 1, j=4 is 6 \u2192 0 (correct), j=7 is 6 \u2192 6 (no change). But in the output, j=7 is 6, which is correct. But in Example 2's row 1, j=4 is 0 \u2192 0 (no change), j=7 is 7 \u2192 7 (no change). But in the example, j=1 is changed. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with the best guess I have, even if it's not perfect. Based on the examples, it seems that in odd rows, certain columns are flipped. For example, in row 1, columns 4 and 13 are flipped. In row 3, columns 4 and 13 are flipped. So perhaps the pattern is that for odd rows, columns 4 and 13 are flipped.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(13):\n        if i % 2 == 1:  # odd row\n            for j in [4, 13]:\n                transformed[i][j] = 6 if transformed[i][j] == 0 else 0\n    return transformed\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's row 1:\n\nj=4: 6 \u2192 0 (correct)\nj=13: 0 \u2192 6 (correct)\n\nThis fits. For Example 2's row 1, j=4 is 0 \u2192 0 (no change), j=13 is 7 \u2192 6 (but in the example, j=13 is 7 in input and output is 7. So this is incorrect.\n\nBut in Example 2's row 1, the output is 7 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 7 7. So j=13 is 7, which is the same as input. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following code based on the observation that in some examples, certain columns are flipped in odd rows. For example, in row 1, columns 4 and 13 are flipped. In row 3, columns 4 and 13 are flipped. This is a guess, but I'll proceed.\n\nFinal answer:\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's take a look at each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 13x14 grid. The output is also 13x14. Looking at the input and output, maybe there's some kind of pattern where certain positions are changed based on their coordinates. Let me check the first row of input and output. The input first row is all 6s and 0s in a pattern. The output first row is similar but maybe some changes. Wait, looking at the first row of input and output:\n\nInput row 0: 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\nOutput row 0: 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\nSo it's the same. But looking at the second row of input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0\nOutput row 1: 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6\nHmm, the output row 1 has some changes. The fourth element in input is 6, but in output it's 6. Then the fifth element is 6 in input, but in output it's 0. Wait, maybe there's a pattern based on the position. Let me check the positions where the 0s are. Maybe the transformation is about flipping certain positions based on their row and column indices.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input and output have similar structures. For example, the first row of input and output are the same. But the second row of input is 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 7, and the output is 7 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 7 7. So the second row of input has some 0s in positions 1,2,4,5, etc. The output seems to have some changes in the middle. Maybe the transformation is about flipping certain positions based on even or odd rows or columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry. For instance, in Example 1, the output seems to have some changes in certain positions. Let me check the third row of input and output. Input row 2 is 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6. Output row 2 is same as input. So maybe the transformation isn't changing some rows. But in other rows, like row 3, input is 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0. Output is 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0. Wait, but in Example 1, the output row 3 is 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0. Wait, but in the input row 3, the 7th element (index 6?) is 6, and in output it's 6. Maybe not. Wait, maybe the pattern is more about certain positions being flipped based on their coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of parity. For example, if the row index is even or odd, or column index is even or odd. Let's think about Example 1's output row 1. The input row 1 is 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0. The output row 1 is 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6. Comparing the input and output, the fifth element (index 4) in input is 6, but in output it's 0. The sixth element (index 5) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. Then the seventh element (index 6) is 6 in input, and 6 in output. The eighth element (index 7) is 6 in input, but in output it's 6. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the value is changed based on the row and column. For example, maybe when the row is odd, certain columns are flipped.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3. The input and output have some changes. Let's check the second row of input and output. Input row 1 is 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1. Output row 1 is 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1. So the fifth element (index 4) in input is 1, but in output it's 0. The sixth element (index 5) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The seventh element (index 6) is 1 in input, but in output it's 1. The eighth element (index 7) is 0 in input, but in output it's 1. The ninth element (index 8) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The tenth element (index 9) is 1 in input, but in output it's 1. The eleventh element (index 10) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The twelfth element (index 11) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The thirteenth element (index 12) is 1 in input, but in output it's 1. Hmm. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of checkerboard pattern. For example, if the sum of row and column is even or odd. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row of output has some changes. Let me think about the positions where the 0s are. For example, in the input row 1, the 4th element (index 3) is 6, but in output it's 6. The fifth element (index 4) is 6 in input, but in output it's 0. The sixth element (index 5) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. Then the seventh element (index 6) is 6 in input, but in output it's 6. The eighth element (index 7) is 6 in input, but in output it's 6. The ninth element (index 8) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The tenth element (index 9) is 6 in input, but in output it's 6. The eleventh element (index 10) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The twelfth element (index 11) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The thirteenth element (index 12) is 6 in input, but in output it's 6. The fourteenth element (index 13) is 0 in input, but in output it's 6. So that's a change in the last element. Wait, but that seems inconsistent. Maybe there's a pattern based on row and column parity.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row's output is 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6. Comparing to the input row 1: 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0. So the fifth element (index 4) in input is 6, but in output it's 0. The sixth element (index 5) is 0 in input, same as output. The seventh element (index 6) is 6 in input, same as output. The eighth element (index 7) is 6 in input, but in output it's 6. The ninth element (index 8) is 0 in input, same as output. The tenth element (index 9) is 6 in input, same as output. The eleventh element (index 10) is 0 in input, same as output. The twelfth element (index 11) is 0 in input, same as output. The thirteenth element (index 12) is 6 in input, same as output. The fourteenth element (index 13) is 0 in input, but in output it's 6. So that's a change. So why is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, in even rows, certain positions are changed. Or maybe for rows where the row index is odd, certain columns are modified. For example, in row 1 (which is the second row, since rows start at 0?), maybe columns 4 and 5 are modified. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of rotation or reflection. For example, in Example 1, the output row 1 seems to have some changes. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input and output have similar patterns. Let me check the second row. Input row 1 is 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 7. Output row 1 is 7 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 7 7. So the first element (index 0) is 7 in input and output. The second element (index 1) is 7 in input, but in output it's 0. The third element (index 2) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The fourth element (index 3) is 7 in input, but in output it's 7. The fifth element (index 4) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0. The sixth element (index 5) is 0 in input, same as output. The seventh element (index 6) is 7 in input, same as output. The eighth element (index 7) is 7 in input, same as output. The ninth element (index 8) is 0 in input, same as output. The tenth element (index 9) is 7 in input, but in output it's 7. The eleventh element (index 10) is 0 in input, but in output it's 7. The twelfth element (index 11) is 0 in input, same as output. The thirteenth element (index 12) is 7 in input, same as output. The fourteenth element (index 13) is 7 in input, same as output. So the second element (index 1) is changed from 7 to 0, and the eleventh element (index 10) is changed from 0 to 7. That seems like a pattern where certain positions are flipped based on their column indices. For example, in row 1, columns 1 and 10 are changed. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of parity. For example, if the column index is even or odd. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output. The second row of input is 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1. The output row is 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1. So the fifth element (index 4) is 1 in input, but in output it's 0. The seventh element (index 6) is 1 in input, but in output it's 1. The eighth element (index 7) is 0 in input, but in output it's 1. The ninth element (index 8) is 0 in input, same as output. The tenth element (index 9) is 1 in input, same as output. The eleventh element (index 10) is 0 in input, same as output. The twelfth element (index 11) is 0 in input, same as output. The thirteenth element (index 12) is 1 in input, same as output. So maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the value is changed based on row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even or odd, and the column is even or odd. For instance, in Example 1, the second row (row index 1) is odd. In that row, maybe certain columns are flipped. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of all examples, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are flipped based on their position. For example, in Example 1's output, row 1 (second row) has the fifth element (index 4) changed from 6 to 0. In Example 2's output, row 1 (second row) has the second element (index 1) changed from 7 to 0 and the eleventh (index 10) changed from 0 to 7. In Example 3's output, row 1 (second row) has the fifth element (index 4) changed from 1 to 0 and the eighth (index 7) changed from 0 to 1. \n\nThis seems like there's a pattern where in certain positions, the value is flipped based on the row and column. For example, maybe in even rows, certain columns are flipped, and in odd rows, others. Or maybe the pattern is that for rows where the row index is even or odd, certain columns are modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain columns are flipped based on their position. For example, in row i, if i is even, then certain columns are changed. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for a pattern in the output compared to the input. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 1 (second row) has the fifth element (index 4) changed from 6 to 0. In Example 2, the same row has the second element (index 1) changed from 7 to 0 and the eleventh (index 10) from 0 to 7. In Example 3, the same row has fifth element (index 4) changed from 1 to 0 and eighth (index 7) from 0 to 1. \n\nThis seems like the pattern is that in row i, for certain columns, the value is flipped. For example, maybe in row i, the columns that are in certain positions (like column 4 and 5, or 1 and 10) are flipped. But how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in each row, the elements at positions where (row + column) is even or odd are changed. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1's row 1, the fifth element (index 4) is 0. In the input, that was 6. The sixth element (index 5) was 0. The seventh element (index 6) was 6. The eighth element (index 7) was 6. The ninth element (index 8) was 0. The tenth element (index 9) was 6. The eleventh element (index 10) was 0. The twelfth element (index 11) was 0. The thirteenth element (index 12) was 6. The fourteenth element (index 13) was 0. In the output, the fifth element (index 4) is 0, the eighth element (index 7) is 6, the fourteenth element (index 13) is 6. So maybe the pattern is that in row 1 (odd row), certain columns are changed. For example, columns 4 and 5 (indices 4 and 5) are changed. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the elements in even columns are kept, and odd columns are flipped. Or something like that. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row has the fifth element (index 4) changed from 6 to 0. Let me check if that index is even or odd. Index 4 is even. But the original value was 6, and the output is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, in even rows, certain columns are modified. Let's think about the examples. For example, in Example 1, the first row (row 0) is the same as input. The second row (row 1) has some changes. The third row (row 2) is the same as input. Fourth row (row 3) has changes. So maybe the transformation is applied to certain rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, row 1 (second row) has some changes. Maybe the pattern is that for rows where the row index is odd, certain columns are modified. For example, in row 1, columns 4 and 5 are modified. In row 3, maybe columns 4 and 5 are modified again. But how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the column indices. For example, in columns where the column index is even or odd. For example, in column 4 (index 4), which is even, maybe some changes are made. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the parity of the row and column. For example, if the row is odd and column is even, then the value is changed. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of all examples, maybe the transformation is that for certain positions, the value is flipped. For example, in the input, if the row is even, then certain columns are flipped. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if (i + j) is even, then it's kept, else it's flipped. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1's output, the second row (row 1) has the fifth element (index 4) changed from 6 to 0. The sum i + j is 1 + 4 = 5, which is odd. So maybe for cells where i + j is odd, the value is changed. But this is just a hypothesis. Let's check other cells in that row. For example, the seventh element (index 6) is 6 in input, and 6 in output. i + j is 1 + 6 = 7, which is odd. But the value is not changed. So that hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row parity. For example, in odd rows, certain columns are changed. For example, in row 1 (odd), columns 4 and 5 are changed. In row 3 (odd), columns 4 and 5 are changed again. But how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, row 1 (second row) has the fifth element (index 4) changed from 6 to 0. The sixth element (index 5) is 0 in input and 0 in output. The eighth element (index 7) is 6 in input and 6 in output. The twelfth element (index 11) is 0 in input and 0 in output. The fourteenth element (index 13) is 0 in input and 6 in output. So that's a change in index 13. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the elements in even positions are kept, and odd positions are flipped. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of all examples, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then it's kept as is, but if i is odd, then some columns are flipped. For example, in Example 1's row 1 (odd), columns 4 and 5 are flipped. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the elements in positions where column is even are flipped. For example, in row 1, columns 0, 2, 4, 6, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the elements at positions where column is even are flipped. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3's row 1, the fifth element (index 4) is 0, which is a change. The eighth element (index 7) is 1, which is a change. So maybe for row 1 (odd), columns 4 and 7 are changed. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in each row, the elements at positions where column is divisible by 4 are changed. For example, in row 1, column 4 is 4, which is divisible by 4. So maybe that's a pattern. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, in row i and column j, if (i + j) is even, then the value is flipped. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of all examples, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if the row index is odd, then the value is flipped if the column index is even. For example, in Example 1's row 1 (odd), columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 are even. But in the output, some of these columns are changed. For example, column 4 (index 4) is changed from 6 to 0. Column 0 is 6 in input and output. Column 2 is 0 in input and output. Column 6 is 6 in input and output. Column 8 is 0 in input and output. Column 10 is 0 in input and output. Column 12 is 6 in input and output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row i, the cells in columns j where j is even are flipped if i is odd. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look at the outputs of all examples and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nLooking at Example 1 and 2, the output seems to have some changes in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the second row has changes in certain columns. In Example 2, the second row has changes in columns 1 and 10. In Example 3, the second row has changes in columns 4 and 7. In Example 4, the second row has changes in columns 4 and 7. \n\nWait, looking at Example 4's input and output. Input row 1 is 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0. Output row 1 is 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0. So the seventh element (index 6) is 1 in input, but in output it's 1. The eighth element (index 7) is 1 in input, but in output it's 0. The ninth element (index 8) is 0 in input, same as output. The tenth element (index 9) is 1 in input, same as output. The eleventh element (index 10) is 0 in input, same as output. The twelfth element (index 11) is 0 in input, same as output. The thirteenth element (index 12) is 1 in input, same as output. The fourteenth element (index 13) is 0 in input, same as output. So in this case, the eighth element (index 7) is changed from 1 to 0. \n\nThis suggests that in row 1 (odd), the eighth column (index 7) is changed. But why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row i, the cells in columns j where j is even are flipped if i is odd. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row i, the cells in columns j where j is even are flipped if i is odd. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1, row 1 (i=1, odd). Columns j=0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 are even. Let's check if these columns are changed. In row 1 of Example 1, the input is 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0. The output is 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6. \n\nSo for j=0 (even), value is 6 in input and output. j=2 (even) is 0 in input and output. j=4 (even) is 6 in input, but in output it's 0. j=6 (even) is 6 in input, same as output. j=8 (even) is 0 in input and output. j=10 (even) is 0 in input and output. j=12 (even) is 6 in input and output. So only j=4 is changed. So this hypothesis is not fully correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for odd rows, certain columns are changed based on their position. For example, in row i, columns j where j is 4 and 5 are changed. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row i, the cells at positions j where (i + j) is odd are flipped. Let's test this for Example 1's row 1 (i=1). For j=0: 1+0=1 (odd) \u2192 flipped. In input, j=0 is 6. In output, it's 6. So no change. j=1: 1+1=2 (even) \u2192 not flipped. Input j=1 is 0, output j=1 is 0. j=2: 1+2=3 (odd) \u2192 flipped. Input j=2 is 0, output j=2 is 0. j=3: 1+3=4 (even) \u2192 no change. Input j=3 is 6, output j=3 is 6. j=4: 1+4=5 (odd) \u2192 flipped. Input j=4 is 6 \u2192 output is 0. j=5: 1+5=6 (even) \u2192 no change. Input j=5 is 0 \u2192 output is 0. j=6: 1+6=7 (odd) \u2192 flipped. Input j=6 is 6 \u2192 output is 6. j=7: 1+7=8 (even) \u2192 no change. Input j=7 is 6 \u2192 output is 6. j=8: 1+8=9 (odd) \u2192 flipped. Input j=8 is 0 \u2192 output is 0. j=9: 1+9=10 (even) \u2192 no change. Input j=9 is 6 \u2192 output is 6. j=10: 1+10=11 (odd) \u2192 flipped. Input j=10 is 0 \u2192 output is 0. j=11: 1+11=12 (even) \u2192 no change. Input j=11 is 0 \u2192 output is 0. j=12: 1+12=13 (odd) \u2192 flipped. Input j=12 is 6 \u2192 output is 6. j=13: 1+13=14 (even) \u2192 no change. Input j=13 is 0 \u2192 output is 6. \n\nSo this hypothesis would predict that in row 1, j=4, j=6, j=8, j=10, j=12 are flipped. But in the actual output, only j=4 and j=13 are changed. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Maybe I should think of a different approach. Perhaps the pattern is that in certain rows, certain columns are flipped based on their position. For example, in row 1 (second row), columns 4 and 5 are flipped. But why?\n\nLooking at the outputs of all examples, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the elements at columns 4 and 5 are flipped. But this is just a guess. For example, in Example 1, row 1, column 4 is changed from 6 to 0. Column 5 is 0 in input and output. In Example 2, row 1, column 1 is changed from 7 to 0 and column 10 is changed from 0 to 7. In Example 3, row 1, column 4 is changed from 1 to 0 and column 7 is changed from 0 to 1. In Example 4, row 1, column 7 is changed from 1 to 0. \n\nThis seems inconsistent. Perhaps the pattern is that for each row, certain columns are flipped based on their position. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if the row is odd and column is even, then the value is flipped. But in Example 1's row 1, columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 are even. Only column 4 is changed. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in even rows, certain columns are flipped. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Since the output is always 13x14, perhaps the transformation is based on some kind of pattern that affects certain rows or columns in a specific way.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, I notice that in some cases, the output is similar to the input but with certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output row 1 has some changes, but the other rows are the same. In Example 2, the output row 1 has changes. In Example 3, the output row 1 has changes. In Example 4, the output row 1 has changes. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each row, certain columns are flipped based on their position. For example, in row i, if i is odd, then the columns at positions 4 and 5 are flipped. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions where (column index) is even are flipped if the row is odd. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 4 and 5 are flipped. But in Example 1, row 1 (odd), column 4 is changed from 6 to 0, and column 5 is 0 in input and output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in row i, the columns at positions (i + 4) % 14 are flipped. But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I have. Let's look at the test input and see what the output should be. The test input is:\n\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6\n6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n\nThe output for this test input is not given, but the task is to write the transformation function. So I need to find a pattern that works for the training examples.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the outputs of the training examples. For example, in Example 1, the output row 1 has some changes. Let's compare the input and output for that row.\n\nInput row 1: 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0\nOutput row 1: 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6\n\nThe changes are at positions 4 (from 6 to 0), 13 (from 0 to 6). \n\nIn Example 2, input row 1: 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 7\nOutput row 1: 7 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 7 7\n\nChanges are at positions 1 (7 to 0), 10 (0 to 7).\n\nIn Example 3, input row 1: 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1\nOutput row 1: 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1\n\nChanges are at positions 4 (1 to 0), 7 (0 to 1).\n\nIn Example 4, input row 1: 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\nOutput row 1: 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0\n\nChange at position 7 (1 to 0).\n\nLooking at these changes, it seems that in the second row (row 1), the changes are at positions that are 4 and 7 (in Example 3 and 4), 1 and 10 (Example 2), and 4 and 13 (Example 1). This is not consistent, but perhaps there's a pattern based on the row index.\n\nFor example, in row 1 (i=1), the changed positions are at j=4, j=7, j=10, j=13. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j where j = (i + 4) % 14 are changed. For example, in row 1, i=1, j=5 (1+4=5). But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for row i, the columns j where j is even are changed. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the changes in row 1 of the examples:\n\nExample 1: j=4 and j=13\nExample 2: j=1 and j=10\nExample 3: j=4 and j=7\nExample 4: j=7\n\nThis seems like the pattern is not consistent, but maybe it's related to the row index. For example, in row 1, the changes are at j=4 (which is 4), j=7 (7), j=10 (10), j=13 (13). These are positions that are 4, 7, 10, 13. These are positions where j is 4 mod 3 = 1, 7 mod 3 = 1, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j where j is 4 + (i * 3) mod 14 are changed. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in row i, the columns j where j is (i + 4) mod 14 are changed. For example, in row 1, j=5. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Maybe I should think of another approach. Perhaps the transformation is based on the row and column indices in a way that for each cell (i,j), if (i + j) is even, then it's kept, else it's flipped. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if i is odd, then the value is flipped if j is even. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's row 1 (i=1, odd), columns j=0,2,4,6,8,10,12 are even. Let's check if these are flipped.\n\nInput row 1: [6,0,0,6,6,0,6,6,0,6,0,0,6,0]\n\nOutput row 1: [6,0,0,6,0,0,6,6,0,6,0,0,6,6]\n\nSo for j=0 (even), value is 6 \u2192 6 (no change). j=2 (even), value is 0 \u2192 0 (no change). j=4 (even), value is 6 \u2192 0 (changed). j=6 (even), value is 6 \u2192 6 (no change). j=8 (even), value is 0 \u2192 0 (no change). j=10 (even), value is 0 \u2192 0 (no change). j=12 (even), value is 6 \u2192 6 (no change). So only j=4 is changed. This fits part of the pattern.\n\nIn Example 2's row 1 (i=1, odd), columns j=0,2,4,6,8,10,12 are even. Let's check.\n\nInput row 1: [7,7,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,7,7]\n\nOutput row 1: [7,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7]\n\nFor j=0 (even): 7 \u2192 7 (no change). j=2 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change). j=4 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change). j=6 (even): 7 \u2192 7 (no change). j=8 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change). j=10 (even): 0 \u2192 7 (changed). j=12 (even): 7 \u2192 7 (no change). So only j=10 is changed. But in the example, j=1 and j=10 are changed. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nBut in this case, j=1 is odd, so it's not part of the even columns. So this suggests that the pattern is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern that involves flipping certain positions based on their row and column indices. For example, in the training examples, the output seems to have changes in certain positions that are related to the row and column indices. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is to flip the value in certain positions based on whether the row is even or odd. For example, in even rows, certain columns are flipped, and in odd rows, other columns are flipped. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to flip the value in positions where the column is even if the row is odd. Let's test this for Example 1's row 1 (odd), columns j=0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. \n\nIn Example 1's row 1, j=4 is changed from 6 to 0. j=12 is 6 in input and output. So this suggests that this is a possible pattern, but it's not clear why only j=4 is changed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j where j is (i * 2) mod 14 are flipped. For example, in row 1, i=1, j=2. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j where j is (i + 4) mod 14 are flipped. For example, in row 1, j=5. But in Example 1's row 1, j=4 is changed. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I have, even if it's not perfect. Let's look at the output of the training examples and try to find a pattern that can be implemented.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the second row has changes in positions 4 and 13. Example 2's second row has changes in positions 1 and 10. Example 3's second row has changes in positions 4 and 7. Example 4's second row has a change in position 7. This suggests that the pattern is not consistent, but perhaps it's related to the row index and column index.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the second row (i=1) has changes in columns that are 4, 7, 10, 13. These are positions that are 4, 7, 10, 13, which are 4 + 3k. For example, 4, 7 (4+3), 10 (7+3), 13 (10+3). But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j where j is (i + 4) mod 14 are changed. For example, in row 1, j=5. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j where j is (i * 3) mod 14 are changed. For example, in row 1, 1*3=3, so j=3. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Perhaps the transformation is based on some kind of rotation or reflection. For example, the output might be a rotated version of the input. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll try to make a hypothesis based on the examples. For example, in the second row (i=1), the changes are in columns that are 4, 7, 10, 13. These are positions that are 4 + 3k. For example, 4, 7 (4+3), 10 (7+3), 13 (10+3). So for row i=1, the columns are 4, 7, 10, 13. This suggests that for row i, the columns j = 4 + 3k, where k is 0, 1, 2, 3. But why?\n\nIf this is the case, then for each row i, the columns j = 4 + 3k are changed. But how to determine k?\n\nAlternatively, for each row i, the columns j = 4 + 3k, where k is such that j is within 0-13. For example, for row i=1, j=4,7,10,13. For row i=3, j=4,7,10,13. But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each row i, the columns j=4,7,10,13 are changed. But how to determine the value to change?\n\nIn Example 1's row 1, j=4 is changed from 6 to 0, and j=13 is changed from 0 to 6. In Example 2's row 1, j=1 is changed from 7 to 0 and j=10 is changed from 0 to 7. This doesn't fit the pattern of j=4,7,10,13.\n\nThis suggests that this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is to flip the value in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, for each cell (i,j), if i is odd and j is even, then flip the value. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to flip the value in positions where (i + j) is even. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: for each cell (i,j), if the row is odd, then flip the value if the column is even. This is a guess, but let's see if it fits the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's row 1 (i=1, odd), columns j=0,2,4,6,8,10,12 are even. Let's check:\n\nInput row 1: [6,0,0,6,6,0,6,6,0,6,0,0,6,0]\n\nOutput row 1: [6,0,0,6,0,0,6,6,0,6,0,0,6,6]\n\nFor j=0 (even): 6 \u2192 6 (no change).\nj=2 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change).\nj=4 (even): 6 \u2192 0 (changed).\nj=6 (even): 6 \u2192 6 (no change).\nj=8 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change).\nj=10 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change).\nj=12 (even): 6 \u2192 6 (no change).\n\nSo only j=4 is changed. This fits part of the pattern.\n\nFor Example 2's row 1 (i=1, odd), columns j=0,2,4,6,8,10,12 are even. Input row 1 is [7,7,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,7,7]. Output is [7,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7].\n\nFor j=0 (even): 7 \u2192 7 (no change).\nj=2 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change).\nj=4 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change).\nj=6 (even): 7 \u2192 7 (no change).\nj=8 (even): 0 \u2192 0 (no change).\nj=10 (even): 0 \u2192 7 (changed).\nj=12 (even): 7 \u2192 7 (no change).\n\nSo only j=10 is changed. But in the example, j=1 and j=10 are changed. This suggests that this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nBut in this case, j=1 is odd, so it's not part of the even columns. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nGiven that, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Perhaps the transformation is to flip the value in certain positions based on the row and column indices, but I'm not able to determine the exact pattern.\n\nAt this point, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the examples, it seems that in certain rows, certain columns are flipped. For example, in row 1, columns 4 and 13 are flipped in Example 1. In Example 2, columns 1 and 10 are flipped. In Example 3, columns 4 and 7 are flipped. In Example 4, column 7 is flipped.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j = (i + 4) mod 14 and j = (i + 7) mod 14 are flipped. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row i, the columns j = (i * 3) mod 14 and j = (i * 3 + 4) mod 14 are flipped. But this is also a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: for each cell (i,j), if the row is odd, then the value is flipped if j is 4 or 7. This is a guess, but let's see.\n\nIn Example 1's row 1, j=4 and j=7 are 4 and 7. In the input, j=4 is 6, which is flipped to 0. j=7 is 6, which is not changed in the output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for row i, the columns j = i + 4 and j = i + 7 are flipped. For example, in row 1, j=5 and j=8. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with a possible pattern that is based on the row being odd and certain columns being flipped. For example, in odd rows, flip the value at column 4 and 7. This is a guess, but let's code it and see.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row i in 0-12:\n    for each column j in 0-13:\n        if i is odd:\n            if j == 4 or j == 7:\n                flip the value (0 becomes 6, 6 becomes 0, etc.)\n        else:\n            leave as is.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1's row 1 (i=1, odd):\nj=4: 6 \u2192 0 (correct)\nj=7: 6 \u2192 6 (no change, but in the output it's 6. So this is correct.\n\nBut in the output, j=13 is changed from 0 to 6. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in odd rows, columns 4, 7, 10, 13 are flipped.\n\nFor Example 1's row 1, j=4,7,10,13.\n\nInput j=4: 6 \u2192 0 (correct)\nj=7: 6 \u2192 6 (no change)\nj=10: 0 \u2192 0 (no change)\nj=13: 0 \u2192 6 (correct)\n\nSo this would fit. But why?\n\nThis suggests that for odd rows, columns 4,7,10,13 are flipped. Let's check other examples.\n\nExample 2's row 1 (i=1, odd):\n\nj=4: 0 \u2192 0 (no change)\nj=7: 7 \u2192 7 (no change)\nj=10: 0 \u2192 7 (correct)\nj=13: 7 \u2192 7 (no change)\n\nBut in the example, j=1 is also changed. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output row 1 has changes at j=1 and j=10. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with the hypothesis that for each row i, the columns j=4,7,10,13 are flipped if the row is odd. This is a guess, but it fits some examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if i % 2 == 1:  # odd row\n                if j in [4,7,10,13]:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6 if transformed[i][j] == 0 else 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is a guess. Let's test it against the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's row 1, this would change j=4,7,10,13. In the input, j=4 is 6 \u2192 0, j=7 is 6 \u2192 0, but in the output it's 6. So this is incorrect.\n\nSo this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nGiven that, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Perhaps the transformation is based on some other pattern, like flipping certain positions based on the row and column indices.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the pattern is that in each row, the value at column 4 is flipped, and the value at column 7 is flipped. Let's test this.\n\nFor Example 1's row 1, j=4 is 6 \u2192 0 (correct), j=7 is 6 \u2192 6 (no change). But in the output, j=7 is 6, which is correct. But in Example 2's row 1, j=4 is 0 \u2192 0 (no change), j=7 is 7 \u2192 7 (no change). But in the example, j=1 is changed. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with the best guess I have, even if it's not perfect. Based on the examples, it seems that in odd rows, certain columns are flipped. For example, in row 1, columns 4 and 13 are flipped. In row 3, columns 4 and 13 are flipped. So perhaps the pattern is that for odd rows, columns 4 and 13 are flipped.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(13):\n        if i % 2 == 1:  # odd row\n            for j in [4, 13]:\n                transformed[i][j] = 6 if transformed[i][j] == 0 else 0\n    return transformed\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's row 1:\n\nj=4: 6 \u2192 0 (correct)\nj=13: 0 \u2192 6 (correct)\n\nThis fits. For Example 2's row 1, j=4 is 0 \u2192 0 (no change), j=13 is 7 \u2192 6 (but in the example, j=13 is 7 in input and output is 7. So this is incorrect.\n\nBut in Example 2's row 1, the output is 7 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 7 7. So j=13 is 7, which is the same as input. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following code based on the observation that in some examples, certain columns are flipped in odd rows. For example, in row 1, columns 4 and 13 are flipped. In row 3, columns 4 and 13 are flipped. This is a guess, but I'll proceed.\n\nFinal answer:\n"
