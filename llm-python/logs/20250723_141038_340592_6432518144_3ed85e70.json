          "content": "Let's analyze the training examples to identify patterns:\n\n### Observations:\n\n1. **Color Mapping:**\n   - The input grid contains integers from 0 to 9.\n   - The output grid appears to have a more complex color mapping, but we can see that certain values are repeated in a similar pattern.\n\n2. **Shapes and Patterns:**\n   - There are distinct shapes and patterns in the input grid, such as clusters of the same number forming specific shapes.\n   - The output grid appears to have a more intricate arrangement of these shapes.\n\n3. **Positioning:**\n   - The positions of the numbers in the output grid seem to be more spread out and less clustered compared to the input grid.\n   - There are also some reflections and rotations observed in the output grid.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nBased on the observations, it seems that the transformation involves:\n- A more complex and spread-out arrangement of numbers.\n- Possible reflections and rotations.\n- A more intricate color mapping.\n\n### Implementation:\nGiven the complexity, we will attempt to implement a transformation that captures some of these patterns. We will:\n- Spread out the numbers more evenly.\n- Apply some rotations and reflections.\n- Use a more complex color mapping.\n\nLet's write the transformation function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert the grid to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Get the dimensions of the grid\n    rows, cols = grid_np.shape\n    \n    # Create an empty output grid\n    transformed_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Function to rotate a 2D array\n    def rotate(arr, k):\n        return np.rot90(arr, k)\n    \n    # Function to reflect a 2D array\n    def reflect(arr, axis):\n        return np.flip(arr, axis=axis)\n    \n    # Apply transformations\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            value = grid_np[i, j]\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread out the value by rotating and reflecting\n                for k in range(4):\n                    for axis in [0, 1]:\n                        transformed_grid[i, j] = value\n                        transformed_grid = reflect(transformed_grid, axis)\n                        transformed_grid = rotate(transformed_grid, k)\n    \n    # Convert the transformed grid back to a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n\n# Example usage:\n# input_grid = ...  # Your input grid here\n# output_grid = transform(input_grid)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Rotation and Reflection:** We use helper functions to rotate and reflect the grid. This adds complexity to the transformation.\n- **Spreading Out:** By applying rotations and reflections, we attempt to spread out the numbers more evenly.\n- **Color Mapping:** While not explicitly changing the color mapping, the transformations add complexity to the grid, which can be seen as a form of color mapping.\n\nThis function attempts to capture some of the observed patterns in the training examples. However, due to the complexity of the transformations, it may not perfectly match the output grids in all cases.",

Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Pattern Observations**:\n   - **Shapes and Colors**: The grids contain numbers from 0 to 9, which could represent different shapes or colors.\n   - **Positions**: The patterns seem to involve specific positions of numbers within the grid.\n   - **Rotations and Reflections**: There are instances where numbers are rotated or reflected.\n\n2. **Transformation Logic**:\n   - **Identify Key Patterns**: Look for recurring patterns in the input and output grids.\n   - **Apply the Transformation**: Use the identified patterns to transform the input grid.\n\nLet's implement a function based on the observed patterns. This function will attempt to capture the transformation logic and apply it to the input grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    # Convert the grid to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules based on the patterns observed\n    # Example transformation: Reflect the grid horizontally and swap specific numbers\n    transformed_grid_np = np.fliplr(grid_np)\n    transformed_grid_np[transformed_grid_np == 8] = 4\n    transformed_grid_np[transformed_grid_np == 4] = 8\n    \n    # Convert the numpy array back to a list\n    transformed_grid = transformed_grid_np.tolist()\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n\n# Example usage:\n# input_grid = [\n#     [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n#     # ...

Let's examine the examples carefully:\n\n### Observations from Training Examples:\n\n1. **Shape and Positioning:**\n   - The shapes in the output grids often appear to be shifted versions of the shapes in the input grids.\n   - There are symmetrical patterns, particularly with shapes centered around the middle of the grid.\n\n2. **Colors (Values):**\n   - The values in the output grids seem to be a transformation of the values in the input grids, often maintaining some form of symmetry or repetition.\n\n3. **Size and Scaling:**\n   - The shapes in the output grids appear to be scaled versions of the shapes in the input grids, sometimes larger or smaller.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nBased on these observations, we hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Shifting the shapes in the input grid.\n- Maintaining or altering the values in a symmetrical manner.\n- Scaling the shapes (either up or down).\n\n### Transformation Logic:\n1. **Identify the center of the grid:**\n   - The center of a 30x30 grid is at position (14, 14).\n\n2. **Shift the shapes:**\n   - Shift the shapes in the input grid based on the center of the grid.\n\n3. **Maintain or alter the values:**\n   - Maintain the values in a symmetrical manner or alter them based on some rule.\n\n4. **Scale the shapes:**\n   - Scale the shapes either up or down based on the input grid.\n\n### Implementation:\nLet's implement this hypothesis in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    # Convert the input grid to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_grid = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Define the center of the grid\n    center = (14, 14)\n    \n    # Define the scaling factor (for simplicity, we'll use a fixed scaling factor)\n    scale_factor = 2\n    \n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = np.zeros((30, 30), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Iterate over the input grid and apply the transformation\n    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):\n            # Calculate the new position after shifting and scaling\n            new_i = center[0] + (i - center[0]) * scale_factor\n            new_j = center[1] + (j - center[1]) * scale_factor\n            \n            # Ensure the new position is within the bounds of the output grid\n            if 0 <= new_i < 30 and 0 <= new_j < 30:\n                output_grid[new_i, new_j] = input_grid[i, j]\n    \n    # Convert the output grid back to a list of lists\n    transformed_grid = output_grid.tolist()\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_grid = [\n    # Your input grid here\n]\n\noutput_grid = transform(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Shifting and Scaling:** The shapes in the input grid are shifted and scaled based on the center of the grid.\n- **Symmetry:** The values are maintained in a symmetrical manner.\n- **Output Grid:** The transformed grid is returned as a 2D list.\n\nThis is a basic implementation based on the observed patterns.

              "content": "Let's analyze the training examples to identify patterns:\n\n### Observations:\n\n1. **Color Mapping:**\n   - The input grid contains integers from 0 to 9.\n   - The output grid appears to have a more complex color mapping, but we can see that certain values are repeated in a similar pattern.\n\n2. **Shapes and Patterns:**\n   - There are distinct shapes and patterns in the input grid, such as clusters of the same number forming specific shapes.\n   - The output grid appears to have a more intricate arrangement of these shapes.\n\n3. **Positioning:**\n   - The positions of the numbers in the output grid seem to be more spread out and less clustered compared to the input grid.\n   - There are also some reflections and rotations observed in the output grid.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nBased on the observations, it seems that the transformation involves:\n- A more complex and spread-out arrangement of numbers.\n- Possible reflections and rotations.\n- A more intricate color mapping.\n\n### Implementation:\nGiven the complexity, we will attempt to implement a transformation that captures some of these patterns. We will:\n- Spread out the numbers more evenly.\n- Apply some rotations and reflections.\n- Use a more complex color mapping.\n\nLet's write the transformation function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert the grid to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Get the dimensions of the grid\n    rows, cols = grid_np.shape\n    \n    # Create an empty output grid\n    transformed_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Function to rotate a 2D array\n    def rotate(arr, k):\n        return np.rot90(arr, k)\n    \n    # Function to reflect a 2D array\n    def reflect(arr, axis):\n        return np.flip(arr, axis=axis)\n    \n    # Apply transformations\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            value = grid_np[i, j]\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread out the value by rotating and reflecting\n                for k in range(4):\n                    for axis in [0, 1]:\n                        transformed_grid[i, j] = value\n                        transformed_grid = reflect(transformed_grid, axis)\n                        transformed_grid = rotate(transformed_grid, k)\n    \n    # Convert the transformed grid back to a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n\n# Example usage:\n# input_grid = ...  # Your input grid here\n# output_grid = transform(input_grid)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Rotation and Reflection:** We use helper functions to rotate and reflect the grid. This adds complexity to the transformation.\n- **Spreading Out:** By applying rotations and reflections, we attempt to spread out the numbers more evenly.\n- **Color Mapping:** While not explicitly changing the color mapping, the transformations add complexity to the grid, which can be seen as a form of color mapping.\n\nThis function attempts to capture some of the observed patterns in the training examples. However, due to the complexity of the transformations, it may not perfectly match the output grids in all cases.",
