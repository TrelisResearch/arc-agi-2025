I notice that in some examples, the output grid appears to be a mirror or rotated version of the input grid, but not always.\n\nFrom the examples, I hypothesize that the transformation might involve:\n1. Symmetry (mirror or rotation)\n2. Pattern preservation\n3. Some changes in specific positions\n\nBased on this, I'll implement a transformation that attempts to preserve the pattern but applies some symmetry and minor changes.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Try to preserve the pattern by mirroring the grid\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(16):\n            # Mirror the grid horizontally\n            if j < 16 - j:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][15 - j]\n    \n    # Try to preserve the pattern by rotating the grid\n    # This is a simple 90-degree rotation\n    rotated = [[0]*16 for _ in range(16)]\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(16):\n            rotated[j][15 - i] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Combine both transformations (mirror and rotate)\n    # We'll use the mirror transformation as it seems to be more consistent\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Try to preserve the pattern by mirroring the grid\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(16):\n            # Mirror the grid horizontally\n            if j < 16 - j:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][15 - j]\n    \n    # Try to preserve the pattern by rotating the grid\n    # This is a simple 90-degree rotation\n    rotated = [[0]*16 for _ in range(16)]\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(16):\n            rotated[j][15 - i] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Combine both transformations (mirror and rotate)\n    # We'll use the mirror transformation as it seems to be more consistent\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
