    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's go through each example one by one.\n\nExample 1:\nInput is a 3x3 grid:\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\nOutput is [1, 1]. Hmm. So the output is a 1x2 grid. What's the connection here? Let's see. The input has some 1s. Maybe the output is related to the positions of the 1s? Or maybe the sum of certain elements?\n\nLooking at the input, the 1s are in positions (1,0) and (2,1). Maybe the output is based on the number of 1s? But the output has two 1s. Wait, but the output is 1 1. So maybe each element in the output is the count of some thing?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 1s. For example, the first output element is 1, and the second is 1. Maybe it's the number of 1s in certain positions. But how?\n\nExample 2:\nInput is:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n0 2 0\nOutput is 2 2 2. So the output is 1x3. The input has 2s in positions (0,1), (1,0), (2,1). Maybe the output is the count of 2s in each row or column? But the output is three 2s. Wait, maybe the output is the sum of the elements in each row? Let's check. First row is 0+2+0=2. Second row is 2+0+0=2. Third row is 0+2+0=2. So output is [2,2,2]. But the output is 1x3. So maybe the output is the sum of each row? But that would be three elements. But the output is 2 2 2. So that matches. But how does that fit with example 1?\n\nIn example 1, the input rows are:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 \u2192 sum 0\nRow 1: 1 0 0 \u2192 sum 1\nRow 2: 0 1 0 \u2192 sum 1\nSo output would be [0,1,1], but the output is [1,1]. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the elements in the first row? But example 1's first row sum is 0. But output is 1 1. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the maximum value in the grid. For example 1, the maximum is 1. Output is two 1s. For example 2, maximum is 2, output is three 2s. Example 3: input has 7, output is 7. Example 4: input has 8s, output is four 8s. Wait, example 4's output is 8 8 8 8. So that's four elements. So maybe the output is the maximum value in the grid, repeated a certain number of times.\n\nBut how to determine the number of elements in the output? For example 1, output is two elements. For example 2, three elements. For example 3, one element. For example 4, four elements. Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit. Wait, maybe the number of elements in the output is the number of rows in the input? But example 1 has 3 rows, output is 2 elements. No. Or maybe the number of columns? Example 1 has 3 columns, output is 2 elements. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum value in the grid, and the number of elements is the number of 1s in the input? For example 1, there are two 1s. Output is two elements. For example 2, the input has three 2s. Output is three elements. For example 3, the input has one 7. Output is one element. For example 4, input has four 8s. Output is four elements. That seems to fit. So the output is a 1xN grid where N is the count of the maximum value in the grid. But wait, example 2's input has three 2s. The output is three 2s. So that would fit. But example 1's input has two 1s, output is two 1s. Example 3 has one 7, output is one 7. Example 4 has four 8s, output is four 8s. So that seems to fit. But how does that work for example 2? Let me check:\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 \u2192 sum 2\nRow 1: 2 0 0 \u2192 sum 2\nRow 2: 0 2 0 \u2192 sum 2\nSo the maximum is 2, and there are three 2s. So output is three 2s. That matches.\n\nBut then, what about example 1? The input has two 1s. Output is two 1s. So that's correct.\n\nBut how to determine the maximum value? Let's check example 3. The input has a 7, and the output is 7. So that's correct.\n\nExample 4: input has 8s. The output is four 8s. So that's correct.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: the output is a 1xN grid where N is the count of the maximum value in the input grid, and each element is the maximum value.\n\nBut wait, in example 2, the maximum is 2, and there are three 2s. So output is three 2s. But how does that fit with the input? Let me check:\n\nIn example 2, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 \u2192 2 is present once.\nRow 1: 2 0 0 \u2192 2 once.\nRow 2: 0 2 0 \u2192 2 once.\nTotal of three 2s. So output is three 2s. So that's correct.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\nFind the maximum value in the grid. Then count how many times that maximum appears. Then output a 1xN grid where N is that count, and each element is the maximum value.\n\nBut wait, example 1's input has two 1s. So output is two 1s. That's correct.\n\nBut what about example 3? The input has one 7. So output is one 7. Correct.\n\nExample 4: four 8s. Output is four 8s. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to fit all the examples. So the transformation is:\n\nFind the maximum value in the grid. Then count how many times that value occurs. Then return a 1xN grid with N elements, each being the maximum value.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nFirst, we need to process the input grid. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, find the maximum value in the grid. Then, count how many times that maximum occurs. Then, create a list of that maximum value, repeated count times.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple maximum values? For example, if the grid has multiple maximums. For example, if the grid has 2s and 3s, then the maximum is 3, and count how many 3s there are.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate through all elements in the grid to find the maximum value.\n\n2. Count the number of times that maximum value appears in the grid.\n\n3. Create a new grid (list of lists) with one row, and the count number of elements, each being the maximum value.\n\nBut wait, the output is a 1x2 grid, 1x3, etc. So the output is a list with one row, and the number of elements is the count.\n\nSo for example, in example 1, the count is 2, so output is [[1,1]].\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet's think about code.\n\nFirst, get the maximum value:\n\nmax_val = max(max(row) for row in grid)\n\nThen, count how many times max_val appears in the grid.\n\ncount = sum(1 for row in grid for cell in row if cell == max_val)\n\nThen, the output is a list with one row, containing [max_val] * count.\n\nBut the output is a 2D list. So for example, if count is 2, then the output is [[max_val, max_val]].\n\nBut in example 2, the output is [2,2,2], which is a 1x3 grid.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    max_val = max(max(row) for row in grid)\n    count = sum(1 for row in grid for cell in row if cell == max_val)\n    return [[max_val] * count]\n\nWait, but in example 1, the output is [1,1], which is [[1,1]], which is correct.\n\nBut let's check example 2: the output is [2,2,2], which is [[2,2,2]], which is correct.\n\nBut example 3: the output is [7], which is [[7]], correct.\n\nExample 4: output is [8,8,8,8], which is [[8,8,8,8]], correct.\n\nSo that seems to fit all examples.\n\nBut wait, what if the grid is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is a 2D list, so it's not empty. Also, the problem says that values are integers from 0-9. So the code should work.\n\nSo the code would be as follows.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the output must be a 1x2 grid. But according to the examples, the output can be of varying lengths. For example, example 2's output is 1x3. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    max_val = max(max(row) for row in grid)\n    count = sum(1 for row in grid for cell in row if cell == max_val)\n    return [[max_val] * count]\n\nBut wait, what if the grid has multiple maximum values? For example, if the grid has 2 and 3, then the code would take the maximum (3) and count how many 3s are there.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this seems to fit all the examples.\n\nBut let me check again:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput grid:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 \u2192 max is 1 (from row 1 and 2). So max_val is 1. Count is 2. So output is [1,1]. Correct.\n\nExample 2: max is 2, count is 3. Output is [2,2,2]. Correct.\n\nExample 3: max is 7, count is 1. Output [7]. Correct.\n\nExample 4: max is 8, count is 4. Output [8,8,8,8]. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to work. Therefore, the code is as above.\n"
