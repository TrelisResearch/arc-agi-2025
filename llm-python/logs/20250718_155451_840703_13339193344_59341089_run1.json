The pattern seems to involve repeating or transforming the input values in a specific way to fill the 3\u00d712 grid.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that the output grid appears to be formed by repeating or transforming the input values in a way that creates patterns or shapes. However, the exact transformation is not immediately clear.\n\nBased on the examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves creating a 3\u00d712 grid where each row of the input is expanded or transformed to fill the 12 columns. The exact method of transformation is not fully clear, but I will implement a pattern that seems to work for the examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x12 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Fill the first row of the output grid with the first row of the input grid repeated\n    for i in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[0][i] = grid[0][i % 3]\n    \n    # Fill the second row of the output grid with the second row of the input grid repeated\n    for i in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[1][i] = grid[1][i % 3]\n    \n    # Fill the third row of the output grid with the third row of the input grid repeated\n    for i in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[2][i] = grid[2][i % 3]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
