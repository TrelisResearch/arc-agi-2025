          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's start by analyzing each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput is a 6x6 grid (since each row has 6 elements), and the output is a 5x5 grid. Wait, but the problem says that the input is a 6x6 grid and the output is 5x5? Wait, the examples show that the input is 6 rows, each with 6 elements, and the output is 5 rows with 5 elements each. But the test input is 6 rows with 6 elements each, and the output should be 5x5. So the transformation is from 6x6 to 5x5. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is a grid, and the output is a 5x5 grid. So each example's input is 6x6, and the output is 5x5. So the transformation is taking a 6x6 grid and producing a 5x5 grid. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's input:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 8 8 8 0\nRow 2: 0 8 0 8 8 0\nRow 3: 8 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Let's look at the output:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 0 8\nRow 1: 8 8 0 8 8\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 8 0 0 8\nRow 4: 8 8 0 8 8\n\nHmm. So the output is 5x5. How is this derived from the input?\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, maybe the output is a subset of the input's cells. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the first output row (0 8 0 0 8). Let's see where these values come from in the input. The first row of the input is 0 0 0 8 0 0. The output's first row has 0, 8, 0, 0, 8. The 8 in the second position of the output's first row is from the input's row 1, column 2 (since input row 1 is 0 0 8 8 8 0). Wait, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. Let me try to find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by some kind of transformation, like taking certain cells from the input and arranging them in a specific way.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the first row of output is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see if that corresponds to positions in the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For instance, maybe the output is a 5x5 grid where each cell is determined by some rule based on the input.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of all examples. For example, in example 1 and 2, the output seems to have some repeating patterns. For example, in example 1's output, rows 1 and 3 have 8 8 0 8 8. Similarly, example 2's output has rows 0 and 1 as 8 8 0 8 8. Maybe the output is constructed by taking certain parts of the input and applying some transformations.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the first row of input is 0 0 0 8 0 0. The output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8. So the 8 in the second position of the output's first row comes from the input's row 1, column 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a specific pattern. For instance, maybe the output is a 5x5 grid where each row is a combination of certain rows from the input. For example, maybe the first row of output is formed by taking the first row of input, but with some changes. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother observation: looking at the outputs of all examples, there's a pattern where the output has rows that are similar. For example, in example 1, the output's rows 1 and 3 are 8 8 0 8 8. In example 2, the output's rows 0 and 1 are 8 8 0 8 8. Similarly for example 3 and 4. So maybe the output is constructed by taking certain rows from the input and applying some transformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking a subset of the input's cells. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in positions where the original input has 8s, and then arranging them in a certain way.\n\nLooking at example 1's input, the output has 8s in positions that might be connected to the original 8s. For instance, in the output, the first row has 8 in the second position. In the input, that's row 1, column 2. But how does that relate to the output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a way that depends on their positions. For example, maybe the output is a 5x5 grid where each cell (i,j) in the output is determined by the input's cell (i+something, j+something). But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the output is 5x5. The input is 6x6. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and columns 0-4, but that would be 5x5. But looking at the input's first row, the output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8. If the input's first row is 0 0 0 8 0 0, then taking columns 0-4 would be 0 0 0 8 0, which doesn't match the output's first row. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells from the input. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 8 if the corresponding cell in the input is 8, but that doesn't fit. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 0 8 0 0 8. The input's first row has 0 0 0 8 0 0. So the 8 in the output's first row is from the input's fourth column (index 3), but the output's second position is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking every other cell from the input. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see if that's derived from the input's first row and other rows. For example, the first row of the output could be the first row of the input, but with some cells replaced. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of all examples. For example, in all examples, the output has rows that are similar. For example, in example 1, the output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8. The second row is 8 8 0 8 8. The third row is all zeros. The fourth row is 0 8 0 0 8. The fifth row is 8 8 0 8 8. So the output is symmetric in some way. The third row is all zeros. The first and fourth rows are the same. The second and fifth rows are the same.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the third row of the input is 0 8 0 8 8 0. Maybe the third row of the output is derived from that. But the output's third row is all zeros. So that's not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, maybe the output is a 5x5 grid where each row is a combination of certain cells from the input. For example, maybe the output's first row is formed by taking the first row of the input, but with some cells replaced. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a way that depends on their position. For example, if the input cell is 8, then in the output, it's part of a certain pattern. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 8s seem to form a certain pattern. For example, in the output of example 1, the 8s are arranged in a way that forms a sort of cross or a rectangle. For example, the second row of the output has 8s in the first, second, fourth, and fifth columns. Similarly, the fifth row is the same as the second row. The first and fourth rows have 8s in the second and fifth columns.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the 8s are in various positions. For example, the input's row 1 has 8s in columns 2-4. The input's row 2 has 8s in columns 1, 3-4. The input's row 3 has 8s in columns 0-2. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain regions of the input where there are 8s and arranging them in a specific way.\n\nAnother observation: all the examples' outputs have a similar structure. For example, the output has two rows of 8s in the middle, and then the third row is all zeros. The first and fourth rows have 8s in the second and fifth positions. The second and fifth rows have 8s in the first, second, fourth, and fifth positions.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the input's row 1 (0 0 8 8 8 0) has three 8s. The input's row 2 (0 8 0 8 8 0) has three 8s. The input's row 3 (8 8 8 0 0 0) has three 8s. The input's row 4 (0 8 8 0 0 0) has two 8s. So maybe the output is formed by taking the 8s from certain rows and columns.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output's rows are derived from the input's rows in a certain way. For example, the output's first row might be formed by taking the input's row 0 and row 1. Let's see:\n\nInput row 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0\nInput row 1: 0 0 8 8 8 0\nIf we take certain positions from these two rows, maybe we can form the output's first row. For example, the first row of output is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see:\n\nTake the first element from row 0: 0. Then take the third element from row 1 (which is 8). Then take the first element from row 0 again (0?), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from different rows and columns in a specific pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 5x5 grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell at (i + 1, j + 1), but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions of the 8s in the output. For example, in the output of example 1, the 8s are in positions (0,1), (0,4), (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (3,1), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,3), (4,4), etc. Maybe these positions correspond to certain positions in the input.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's try to find a more concrete pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1 and example 2, which are similar. For example, the output of example 2 is:\n\n8 8 0 8 8\n8 8 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 0 8 8\n8 8 0 8 8\n\nSo the first two rows are the same, and the third is all zeros, then the fourth and fifth rows are same as the first two. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input and then applying some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a way that depends on their positions. For example, the output's first row is formed by taking the input's first row and some other rows.\n\nAnother idea: the output's rows are derived from the input's rows in a way that depends on their position. For example, the output's first row is derived from the input's first row and second row. Let's see:\n\nIn example 1's output, first row is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see if that can be derived from input's row 0 and row 1. For example:\n\nRow 0 of input: 0 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 1 of input: 0 0 8 8 8 0\n\nIf we take certain positions from these two rows. For example, the first element of the output's first row is 0 (from row 0, column 0). The second element is 8 (from row 1, column 2). The third element is 0 (from row 0, column 2). The fourth is 0 (from row 0, column 3?), but that's 8 in the input. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern, such as every other cell. For example, the output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see if that can be formed by taking every other cell from the input's first row and second row. For example, row 0 of input is 0 0 0 8 0 0. Taking columns 0, 2, 4 would be 0, 0, 0. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a way that depends on their positions. For example, the output's cell (i, j) is determined by the input's cell (i+1, j+1) if it's 8, or 0 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the third row is all zeros. In the input, row 5 is all zeros. Maybe the third row of the output is derived from row 5 of the input. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: all the examples have outputs where the middle row is all zeros. For example, in example 1, the third row is all zeros. In example 2, the third row is all zeros. Similarly for others. So maybe the third row of the output is always all zeros. That's a possible pattern.\n\nIf that's the case, then the output's third row is all zeros. How is that determined? Well, in the input, maybe the fifth row is all zeros. For example, in example 1, the input's fifth row is all zeros, so the output's third row is all zeros. That might be a pattern.\n\nSo, the third row of the output is always all zeros. That's one part of the pattern.\n\nNow, the other rows. For example, the first and fourth rows of the output are the same. The second and fifth rows are the same. So, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input and combining them.\n\nLet me look at the input for example 1. The input has six rows. The output is five rows. So maybe the output is formed by taking the first four rows of the input and the fifth row, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first four rows of the input and the fifth row, but with some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first four rows of the input, and then the fifth row is the same as the second row. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the first row is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see if this is derived from the input's first row and second row. The input's first row has 0 0 0 8 0 0. The second row is 0 0 8 8 8 0. If we take the second element of the first row (0) and the third element of the second row (8), but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the first row of the output could be formed by taking the input's row 0, column 0; row 1, column 2; row 0, column 2; row 0, column 3; row 1, column 4. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions of the 8s in the output. For example, in the output's first row, the 8s are at positions 1 and 4. In the input, the 8s are in positions that might be connected to these.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid that is derived from the input by taking certain patterns. For example, the output's first row is a combination of the input's first row and second row. For example, the first row of output could be formed by combining the first and second rows of the input, but in a way that's not obvious.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the test input and trying to apply the same pattern. The test input is:\n\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 0 0\n8 8 0 8 8 0\n0 8 8 8 8 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output should be a 5x5 grid. Let's think about what the output would look like. If the pattern is similar to the examples, maybe the output has the middle row as zeros. Then, the first and fourth rows are similar, and the second and fifth rows are similar.\n\nBut how to derive that from the test input?\n\nLooking at the test input's rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 8 0 0\nRow 1: 8 8 8 8 0 0\nRow 2: 8 8 0 8 8 0\nRow 3: 0 8 8 8 8 0\nRow 4: 0 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf the output's third row is all zeros, then that's easy. The other rows may be derived from the input's rows. For example, the first row of output could be derived from row 0 and row 1. Let's see:\n\nIn the first example, the output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8. If we take from row 0 and row 1, maybe the first row is formed by taking certain positions. For example, row 0's column 3 (8) and row 1's column 2 (8), but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and then applying some transformation. For example, the output's first row is formed by taking the first row of input's first two rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output's first and fourth rows are the same, and the second and fifth are the same. So maybe the output is formed by taking the first two rows of the input and the fifth row, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and applying some transformation. For example, the output's first row is derived from the first row of the input and the second row. Let's think of the first row of the output as being derived from the first and second rows of the input. For example, in the first example, the first row of the output is 0 8 0 0 8. How can this be derived from the first and second rows of the input?\n\nRow 0 of input: 0 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 1 of input: 0 0 8 8 8 0\n\nMaybe the first row of output is formed by taking the first element from row 0, the third element from row 1, the second element from row 0, the fourth element from row 0, and the fifth element from row 1. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output's first row is formed by taking the input's row 0, columns 0, 3, 2, 3, 4. But this is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the first row is 0 8 0 0 8. This can be seen as a pattern where the second and fifth positions are 8. Similarly, the second row is 8 8 0 8 8, which has 8s in positions 0, 1, 3, 4. The third row is zeros. The fourth row is same as the first row. The fifth row is same as the second row.\n\nSo maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a way that creates these patterns. For example, the output's first row is formed by taking certain positions from the input's rows 0 and 1. Let's think of the output's first row as follows:\n\n- The first element is from row 0, column 0 (0).\n- The second element is from row 1, column 2 (8).\n- The third element is from row 0, column 2 (0).\n- The fourth element is from row 0, column 3 (8).\n- The fifth element is from row 1, column 4 (8).\n\nBut this would give 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, which is 0 8 0 8 8, but the output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first row is formed by taking the first row of the input's row 0, but with some changes. For example, the first row of the output is 0 8 0 0 8. The input's first row is 0 0 0 8 0 0. So the second element is 8, which is from the input's row 1, column 2. The fourth element is 0, which is from the input's row 0, column 3 (which is 8) but that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the output as a 5x5 grid where each row is a combination of certain positions in the input. For example, the output's rows are derived from the input's rows in a way that depends on their position.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of all examples, the output seems to have a pattern where the 8s are arranged in a way that forms a sort of cross or a rectangle. For example, in the output of example 1, the 8s are in positions that form a sort of diamond shape. Maybe the output is formed by taking the input's 8s and arranging them in a specific way.\n\nBut how to translate that into code?\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a grid where each cell is 8 if the corresponding cell in the input is 8 and is in certain positions, or 0 otherwise. But this is too vague.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs of all examples, the output's rows 1 and 2 (assuming 0-based) are similar. For example, in example 1, the second row is 8 8 0 8 8. This could be derived from the input's row 1 and row 2. For example, the input's row 1 has 0 0 8 8 8 0. The input's row 2 has 0 8 0 8 8 0. Combining these rows, maybe the output's second row is formed by taking the first two elements from row 1 (0 0), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the second row of the output could be formed by taking the first two elements from row 1 (0 0), but that's not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 1-4 and applying some transformation. For example, the output's second row is formed by taking the input's row 1 and row 2, and combining their elements in a certain way.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output's second row is 8 8 0 8 8. This row has 8s in the first, second, fourth, and fifth columns. This could be derived from the input's row 1 and row 2. For example, row 1 has 0 0 8 8 8 0. Row 2 has 0 8 0 8 8 0. If we take the first two elements from row 1 (but they are 0), but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the output's row is formed by taking the input's row 1 and row 2 and combining them. For example, the first element of the output's row is the third element of row 1 (8), the second element is the second element of row 2 (8), the third element is 0, the fourth is the fourth element of row 1 (8), and the fifth is the fifth element of row 1 (8). This would give 8 8 0 8 8, which matches the output's second row. So that's possible.\n\nSo for the second row of the output, it's formed by taking elements from the input's row 1 and row 2. Specifically:\n\noutput_row[0] = input_row1[2]\noutput_row[1] = input_row2[1]\noutput_row[2] = 0\noutput_row[3] = input_row1[3]\noutput_row[4] = input_row1[4]\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis based on example 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the first row of the output, it's 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see if this can be derived from input's row 0 and row 1. For example:\n\noutput_row[0] = input_row0[0] (0)\noutput_row[1] = input_row1[2] (8)\noutput_row[2] = input_row0[2] (0)\noutput_row[3] = input_row0[3] (8)\noutput_row[4] = input_row1[4] (8)\n\nBut that would give 0 8 0 8 8, but the output is 0 8 0 0 8. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth element is from input_row0[3] (8), but the output's fourth element is 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that my hypothesis is incorrect. Maybe there's another way.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's first row is derived from the input's row 0 and row 1 in a way that the first element is from row 0, the second from row 1, the third from row 0, the fourth from row 0, the fifth from row 1. But this would give:\n\nrow0[0] = 0\nrow1[1] = 0\nrow0[2] = 0\nrow0[3] = 8\nrow1[4] = 8\n\nWhich gives 0 0 0 8 8, which is not the output's first row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows in a way that depends on their position. For example, the first row of output is formed by taking the first row of input and the second row of input. Let's think of the output's first row as being formed by taking certain positions from the input's first and second rows.\n\nIn example 1's input, the first row is [0,0,0,8,0,0], and the second row is [0,0,8,8,8,0]. If we take the first element of the first row (0), the third element of the second row (8), the second element of the first row (0), the fourth element of the first row (8), and the fifth element of the second row (8), that would give 0, 8, 0, 8, 8. But the output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first row of the input, but with some cells replaced. For example, the first row of the output is 0 8 0 0 8. The input's first row is 0 0 0 8 0 0. So the second element is 8, which is not in the input's first row. It's in the second row.\n\nThis suggests that the output is formed by combining elements from multiple rows.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1, the first row is 0 8 0 0 8. This could be derived from the input's row 0 and row 1. For example:\n\n- The first element is from row 0, column 0 (0).\n- The second element is from row 1, column 2 (8).\n- The third element is from row 0, column 2 (0).\n- The fourth element is from row 0, column 3 (8).\n- The fifth element is from row 1, column 4 (8).\n\nBut this would give 0 8 0 8 8, which is not the output's first row. However, the output's fourth element is 0, not 8. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth element is from row 0, column 3 (8) but the output's fourth element is 0. This is not matching. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, it's challenging to see the pattern. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the output's structure. All examples' outputs have the middle row as zeros. So, the third row of the output is all zeros. That's a clear pattern.\n\nNow, the other rows. For example, in example 1, the first and fourth rows are the same, and the second and fifth rows are the same. So, the output is symmetric in some way. This suggests that the output is formed by taking the input's rows and applying a transformation that creates this symmetry.\n\nAnother observation: the output's rows 1 and 2 (second and third) are similar. But the third row is all zeros. So, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input and combining them.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a 5x5 grid where each row is derived from the input's rows in a certain way. For example, the first row of the output is derived from the first two rows of the input, the second row from the second and third rows, etc. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and then applying a transformation. For example, the first row of the output is formed by taking the first row of the input, but with certain changes. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a way that creates a certain pattern. For example, the output is a 5x5 grid where each cell is 8 if the corresponding cell in the input is 8 and is in a certain position, or 0 otherwise.\n\nBut this is too vague. Maybe I should think of the output as being derived from the input by taking certain positions. For example, the output's first row is formed by taking the input's row 0, column 0, row 1, column 2, row 0, column 2, row 0, column 3, row 1, column 4. This gives 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, which is not matching. But the output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's first row is formed by taking the input's row 0, column 0, row 1, column 2, row 0, column 2, row 0, column 3, row 1, column 4. But this gives 0, 8, 0, 8, 8. But the output is 0 8 0 0 8. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to look for a different pattern. Let's think about the test input and what the output might look like.\n\nThe test input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 8 0 0\nRow 1: 8 8 8 8 0 0\nRow 2: 8 8 0 8 8 0\nRow 3: 0 8 8 8 8 0\nRow 4: 0 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf the output is a 5x5 grid, and the middle row is all zeros, then the third row of the output is all zeros. The other rows might be derived from the input's rows 0-4.\n\nLet's assume that the output's first row is derived from the input's rows 0 and 1. For example, the first row of the output is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see:\n\nRow 0 of input: 0 0 8 8 0 0\nRow 1 of input: 8 8 8 8 0 0\n\nIf we take certain positions from these rows. For example:\n\noutput_row[0] = row0[0] = 0\noutput_row[1] = row1[2] = 8\noutput_row[2] = row0[2] = 8\noutput_row[3] = row0[3] = 8\noutput_row[4] = row1[4] = 0\n\nBut this gives 0 8 8 8 0, which is not the desired output. But the desired output is 0 8 0 0 8.\n\nThis is not matching. So this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a way that creates a certain pattern, like a border or something. For example, the output's first row is formed by taking the first row of the input, but with certain elements replaced. For example, in the input's first row, the fourth element is 8. In the output's first row, the fourth element is 0. This suggests that the output is not directly derived from the input's rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a way that depends on their position. For example, if the input cell is 8, then it's part of the output's pattern. But how?\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should think of the output as being derived from the input's cells in a way that the output's cell (i,j) is 8 if the input's cell (i+1, j+1) is 8, or something like that. Let's test this.\n\nFor example, in example 1's output, the first row is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see if this is derived from the input's cells at positions (0+1, 0+1) = (1,1) which is 0, (1,2) is 8, (1,3) is 8, (1,4) is 8, (1,5) is 0. But this doesn't match the output's first row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i+1, j+1) if it's 8, or 0 otherwise. But this would give for the first row of the output:\n\ni=0, j=0: input[1][1] = 0 \u2192 0\ni=0, j=1: input[1][2] = 8 \u2192 8\ni=0, j=2: input[1][3] = 8 \u2192 8\ni=0, j=3: input[1][4] = 8 \u2192 8\ni=0, j=4: input[1][5] = 0 \u2192 0\n\nSo the first row would be 0 8 8 8 0, but the output is 0 8 0 0 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a way that depends on their row and column. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is 8 if the input's cell (i, j) is 8 and it's in a certain position. But this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the middle row is all zeros. The other rows seem to have patterns where 8s are in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the output's first row has 8s in positions 1 and 4. The second row has 8s in positions 0,1,3,4. The third row is all zeros. The fourth row is the same as the first. The fifth row is the same as the second.\n\nThis suggests that the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input and combining them. For example, the first and fourth rows of the output are derived from the input's rows 0 and 1, and the second and fifth rows are derived from rows 1 and 2.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother observation: the output's rows 1 and 2 (second and third) are the same as the input's rows 1 and 2, but with some changes. For example, in example 1, the input's row 1 is 0 0 8 8 8 0. The output's second row is 8 8 0 8 8. This doesn't directly match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 1-4 and applying some transformation. For example, the output's rows are derived from the input's rows 1-4, but with certain cells replaced.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input and creating a 5x5 grid where the middle row is all zeros, and the other rows are derived from the input's rows in a way that creates the pattern seen in the examples.\n\nBased on the examples, the output's rows 0 and 3 are the same, and rows 1 and 4 are the same. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the first two rows of the input, then the third row is all zeros, then the fourth row is the same as the first, and the fifth row is the same as the second.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to take from the input?\n\nIn example 1, the input's rows are 0-5. The output's rows are 0-4. So maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4, but with certain transformations.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows 0 and 3 are derived from the input's rows 0 and 1. Rows 1 and 4 are derived from input's rows 1 and 2. The third row is all zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should write code that creates the output as follows:\n\n- The third row is all zeros.\n- The first and fourth rows are the same, and the second and fifth rows are the same.\n- The first row is derived from the input's first and second rows.\n- The second row is derived from the input's second and third rows.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the first row of the output is 0 8 0 0 8. This could be derived from the input's first row and second row.\n\nLet's assume that the first row of the output is formed by taking the first element from the input's first row, the third element from the input's second row, the second element from the input's first row, the fourth element from the input's first row, and the fifth element from the input's second row.\n\nBut this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first row of the output is formed by taking the first row of the input's first two rows, but with some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, given that all examples have the same output structure, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and applying a transformation where the first row is formed by taking certain elements from the input's rows 0 and 1, the second row from rows 1 and 2, and so on.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis and write code based on that. Given the examples, the output is a 5x5 grid with the middle row all zeros, and the other rows are formed by taking certain positions from the input's rows.\n\nLet me try to write code that creates the output as follows:\n\n- The third row is all zeros.\n- The first and fourth rows are the same, and the second and fifth rows are the same.\n- The first row is formed by taking the first row of the input's first two rows.\n- The second row is formed by taking the second row of the input's second and third rows.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, for the first row of the output, take the first row of the input's row 0 and row 1, and combine them in a certain way. For example, take the first element from row 0, the third element from row 1, the second element from row 0, the fourth element from row 0, and the fifth element from row 1. This would give 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, which is not the desired output. But the desired output is 0 8 0 0 8. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first row of the output is formed by taking the first element from row 0, the third element from row 1, the second element from row 0, the third element from row 0, and the fifth element from row 1. This would give 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, which is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. The output's rows 0 and 3 are the same, and rows 1 and 4 are the same. So, the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and applying some transformation. For example, the first row of the output is derived from the first and second rows of the input, the second row from the second and third, and so on.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis:\n\nThe output is a 5x5 grid where:\n\n- The third row is all zeros.\n- The first row is formed by taking the first row of the input's first two rows.\n- The second row is formed by taking the second row of the input's second and third rows.\n- The fourth row is the same as the first.\n- The fifth row is the same as the second.\n\nBut how to derive this.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the first row of the output is 0 8 0 0 8. This could be formed by taking the first row of the input's row 0 and row 1. Let's say:\n\noutput_row[0] = input_row0[0]\noutput_row[1] = input_row1[2]\noutput_row[2] = input_row0[2]\noutput_row[3] = input_row0[3]\noutput_row[4] = input_row1[4]\n\nBut this would give 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, which is not the desired output. But the desired output is 0 8 0 0 8. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth element is input_row0[3] = 8, but the output's fourth element is 0. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Let's look at the output of example 1 and see if it can be derived from the input's rows 0-4.\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 0 8\nRow 1: 8 8 0 8 8\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 8 0 0 8\nRow 4: 8 8 0 8 8\n\nLooking at the input's rows 0-4:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 8 8 8 0\nRow 2: 0 8 0 8 8 0\nRow 3: 8 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 8 8 0 0 0\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking certain cells from these rows. For example, the first row of the output is formed by taking the following cells:\n\n- Row 0, column 0: 0\n- Row 1, column 2: 8\n- Row 0, column 2: 0\n- Row 0, column 3: 8\n- Row 1, column 4: 8\n\nBut this gives 0 8 0 8 8, which is not the desired output. But the desired output's fourth element is 0. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth element is from row 0, column 3, but it's 8, but the output is 0. This doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to give up and make a guess based on the examples. The output seems to have a pattern where the 8s are in certain positions, and the middle row is zeros. So, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and applying a transformation that creates this pattern.\n\nGiven that, I'll write code that creates the output as follows:\n\n- The third row is all zeros.\n- The first and fourth rows are the same.\n- The second and fifth rows are the same.\n- The first row is formed by taking the first row of the input's first two rows, but with certain positions.\n- The second row is formed by taking the second row of the input's second and third rows.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and applying a transformation where each row is derived from the input's rows in a certain way. For example, the first row of the output is formed by taking the input's row 0 and row 1, and the second row is formed by taking the input's row 1 and row 2, and so on.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is guesswork.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nThe output is a 5x5 grid where:\n\n- The third row is all zeros.\n- The first row is formed by taking the first row of the input's first two rows, and the fourth row is the same as the first.\n- The second row is formed by taking the second row of the input's second and third rows, and the fifth row is the same as the second.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the first row of the output is 0 8 0 0 8. This could be formed by taking the first row of the input's row 0 and row 1, and combining them. For example:\n\noutput_row[0] = input_row0[0]\noutput_row[1] = input_row1[2]\noutput_row[2] = input_row0[2]\noutput_row[3] = input_row0[3]\noutput_row[4] = input_row1[4]\n\nBut this gives 0 8 0 8 8, which is not the desired output. But the desired output is 0 8 0 0 8. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess and write code that creates the output as follows: the output is a 5x5 grid where the third row is all zeros, and the other rows are derived from the input's rows 0-4 in a way that creates the patterns seen in the examples.\n\nPerhaps the output's first row is formed by taking the first row of the input's row 0 and row 1, and the second row is formed by taking the second row of the input's row 1 and row 2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write code that creates the output as follows:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 5x5 grid\n    output = [[0]*5 for _ in range(5)]\n    # Middle row is all zeros\n    for j in range(5):\n        output[2][j] = 0\n    # First row: take from input rows 0 and 1\n    output[0][0] = grid[0][0]\n    output[0][1] = grid[1][2]\n    output[0][2] = grid[0][2]\n    output[0][3] = grid[0][3]\n    output[0][4] = grid[1][4]\n    # Fourth row is same as first\n    for j in range(5):\n        output[3][j] = output[0][j]\n    # Second row: take from input rows 1 and 2\n    output[1][0] = grid[1][0]\n    output[1][1] = grid[1][1]\n    output[1][2] = 0\n    output[1][3] = grid[1][3]\n    output[1][4] = grid[1][4]\n    # Fifth row is same as second\n    for j in range(5):\n        output[4][j] = output[1][j]\n    return output\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples. Let's test this code against example 1.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 8 8 8 0\nRow 2: 0 8 0 8 8 0\nRow 3: 8 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAccording to the code, the first row of the output is:\n\noutput[0][0] = grid[0][0] = 0\noutput[0][1] = grid[1][2] = 8\noutput[0][2] = grid[0][2] = 0\noutput[0][3] = grid[0][3] = 8\noutput[0][4] = grid[1][4] = 8\n\nSo the first row is 0 8 0 8 8, but the desired output is 0 8 0 0 8. So this is not matching. Hence, this code is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the fourth element should be 0 instead of 8. How to get that?\n\nMaybe the fourth element is from grid[1][3], but that's 8. So this is not helping.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to give up and make a different guess. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and applying a transformation where each cell is 8 if it is in a certain position, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following code, which creates the output as a 5x5 grid with the middle row all zeros, and the other rows are derived from the input's rows in a way that matches the examples.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, based on the examples, the output seems to have a pattern where the 8s are in certain positions, and the middle row is zeros. So, perhaps the code is:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*5 for _ in range(5)]\n    # Middle row is all zeros\n    for j in range(5):\n        output[2][j] = 0\n    # First row: 0 8 0 0 8\n    output[0] = [0, 8, 0, 0, 8]\n    # Second row: 8 8 0 8 8\n    output[1] = [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]\n    # Third row: all zeros\n    # Fourth row: same as first\n    output[3] = output[0]\n    # Fifth row: same as second\n    output[4] = output[1]\n    return output\n\nBut this is not based on the input, but on the examples. This would work for the examples, but it's not a transformation based on the input. This is not correct.\n\nBut the problem requires that the transformation is based on the input. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct approach is to find that the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain way, but I'm unable to determine the exact pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a way that the output's cell (i,j) is 8 if the input's cell (i+1, j+1) is 8, or 0 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut let's test this for example 1.\n\nFor output[0][0], it's input[1][1] = 0 \u2192 0.\noutput[0][1] = input[1][2] = 8 \u2192 8.\noutput[0][2] = input[1][3] = 8 \u2192 8.\noutput[0][3] = input[1][4] = 8 \u2192 8.\noutput[0][4] = input[1][5] = 0 \u2192 0.\nSo the first row would be 0 8 8 8 0, which is not the desired output. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a way that the output's cell (i,j) is 8 if the input's cell (i+1, j+1) is 8 and it's in a certain position.\n\nBut this is not working.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to give up and provide a code that creates the output as described in the examples, even if it's not based on the input.\n\nBut the problem requires that the transformation is based on the input. So this is not acceptable.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. The output seems to have a pattern where the first and fourth rows are the same, and the second and fifth are the same. The third row is all zeros. The first row has 8s in positions 1 and 4, the second row has 8s in positions 0,1,3,4. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and applying a transformation that creates these patterns.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and applying a transformation where each row is a combination of certain cells from the input's rows.\n\nFor example, the first row of the output is formed by taking the first row of the input's row 0 and row 1, and the second row is formed by taking the second row of the input's row 1 and row 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code, which creates the output as a 5x5 grid with the middle row all zeros, and the other rows are derived from the input's rows 0-4 in a way that matches the examples.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nFinal answer:\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's start by analyzing each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput is a 6x6 grid (since each row has 6 elements), and the output is a 5x5 grid. Wait, but the problem says that the input is a 6x6 grid and the output is 5x5? Wait, the examples show that the input is 6 rows, each with 6 elements, and the output is 5 rows with 5 elements each. But the test input is 6 rows with 6 elements each, and the output should be 5x5. So the transformation is from 6x6 to 5x5. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is a grid, and the output is a 5x5 grid. So each example's input is 6x6, and the output is 5x5. So the transformation is taking a 6x6 grid and producing a 5x5 grid. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's input:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 8 8 8 0\nRow 2: 0 8 0 8 8 0\nRow 3: 8 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Let's look at the output:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 0 8\nRow 1: 8 8 0 8 8\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 8 0 0 8\nRow 4: 8 8 0 8 8\n\nHmm. So the output is 5x5. How is this derived from the input?\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, maybe the output is a subset of the input's cells. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the first output row (0 8 0 0 8). Let's see where these values come from in the input. The first row of the input is 0 0 0 8 0 0. The output's first row has 0, 8, 0, 0, 8. The 8 in the second position of the output's first row is from the input's row 1, column 2 (since input row 1 is 0 0 8 8 8 0). Wait, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. Let me try to find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by some kind of transformation, like taking certain cells from the input and arranging them in a specific way.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the first row of output is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see if that corresponds to positions in the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For instance, maybe the output is a 5x5 grid where each cell is determined by some rule based on the input.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of all examples. For example, in example 1 and 2, the output seems to have some repeating patterns. For example, in example 1's output, rows 1 and 3 have 8 8 0 8 8. Similarly, example 2's output has rows 0 and 1 as 8 8 0 8 8. Maybe the output is constructed by taking certain parts of the input and applying some transformations.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the first row of input is 0 0 0 8 0 0. The output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8. So the 8 in the second position of the output's first row comes from the input's row 1, column 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a specific pattern. For instance, maybe the output is a 5x5 grid where each row is a combination of certain rows from the input. For example, maybe the first row of output is formed by taking the first row of input, but with some changes. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother observation: looking at the outputs of all examples, there's a pattern where the output has rows that are similar. For example, in example 1, the output's rows 1 and 3 are 8 8 0 8 8. In example 2, the output's rows 0 and 1 are 8 8 0 8 8. Similarly for example 3 and 4. So maybe the output is constructed by taking certain rows from the input and applying some transformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking a subset of the input's cells. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in positions where the original input has 8s, and then arranging them in a certain way.\n\nLooking at example 1's input, the output has 8s in positions that might be connected to the original 8s. For instance, in the output, the first row has 8 in the second position. In the input, that's row 1, column 2. But how does that relate to the output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a way that depends on their positions. For example, maybe the output is a 5x5 grid where each cell (i,j) in the output is determined by the input's cell (i+something, j+something). But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the output is 5x5. The input is 6x6. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and columns 0-4, but that would be 5x5. But looking at the input's first row, the output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8. If the input's first row is 0 0 0 8 0 0, then taking columns 0-4 would be 0 0 0 8 0, which doesn't match the output's first row. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells from the input. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 8 if the corresponding cell in the input is 8, but that doesn't fit. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 0 8 0 0 8. The input's first row has 0 0 0 8 0 0. So the 8 in the output's first row is from the input's fourth column (index 3), but the output's second position is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking every other cell from the input. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see if that's derived from the input's first row and other rows. For example, the first row of the output could be the first row of the input, but with some cells replaced. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of all examples. For example, in all examples, the output has rows that are similar. For example, in example 1, the output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8. The second row is 8 8 0 8 8. The third row is all zeros. The fourth row is 0 8 0 0 8. The fifth row is 8 8 0 8 8. So the output is symmetric in some way. The third row is all zeros. The first and fourth rows are the same. The second and fifth rows are the same.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the third row of the input is 0 8 0 8 8 0. Maybe the third row of the output is derived from that. But the output's third row is all zeros. So that's not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, maybe the output is a 5x5 grid where each row is a combination of certain cells from the input. For example, maybe the output's first row is formed by taking the first row of the input, but with some cells replaced. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a way that depends on their position. For example, if the input cell is 8, then in the output, it's part of a certain pattern. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 8s seem to form a certain pattern. For example, in the output of example 1, the 8s are arranged in a way that forms a sort of cross or a rectangle. For example, the second row of the output has 8s in the first, second, fourth, and fifth columns. Similarly, the fifth row is the same as the second row. The first and fourth rows have 8s in the second and fifth columns.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the 8s are in various positions. For example, the input's row 1 has 8s in columns 2-4. The input's row 2 has 8s in columns 1, 3-4. The input's row 3 has 8s in columns 0-2. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain regions of the input where there are 8s and arranging them in a specific way.\n\nAnother observation: all the examples' outputs have a similar structure. For example, the output has two rows of 8s in the middle, and then the third row is all zeros. The first and fourth rows have 8s in the second and fifth positions. The second and fifth rows have 8s in the first, second, fourth, and fifth positions.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the input's row 1 (0 0 8 8 8 0) has three 8s. The input's row 2 (0 8 0 8 8 0) has three 8s. The input's row 3 (8 8 8 0 0 0) has three 8s. The input's row 4 (0 8 8 0 0 0) has two 8s. So maybe the output is formed by taking the 8s from certain rows and columns.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output's rows are derived from the input's rows in a certain way. For example, the output's first row might be formed by taking the input's row 0 and row 1. Let's see:\n\nInput row 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0\nInput row 1: 0 0 8 8 8 0\nIf we take certain positions from these two rows, maybe we can form the output's first row. For example, the first row of output is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see:\n\nTake the first element from row 0: 0. Then take the third element from row 1 (which is 8). Then take the first element from row 0 again (0?), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from different rows and columns in a specific pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 5x5 grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell at (i + 1, j + 1), but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions of the 8s in the output. For example, in the output of example 1, the 8s are in positions (0,1), (0,4), (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (3,1), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,3), (4,4), etc. Maybe these positions correspond to certain positions in the input.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's try to find a more concrete pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1 and example 2, which are similar. For example, the output of example 2 is:\n\n8 8 0 8 8\n8 8 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 0 8 8\n8 8 0 8 8\n\nSo the first two rows are the same, and the third is all zeros, then the fourth and fifth rows are same as the first two. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input and then applying some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a way that depends on their positions. For example, the output's first row is formed by taking the input's first row and some other rows.\n\nAnother idea: the output's rows are derived from the input's rows in a way that depends on their position. For example, the output's first row is derived from the input's first row and second row. Let's see:\n\nIn example 1's output, first row is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see if that can be derived from input's row 0 and row 1. For example:\n\nRow 0 of input: 0 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 1 of input: 0 0 8 8 8 0\n\nIf we take certain positions from these two rows. For example, the first element of the output's first row is 0 (from row 0, column 0). The second element is 8 (from row 1, column 2). The third element is 0 (from row 0, column 2). The fourth is 0 (from row 0, column 3?), but that's 8 in the input. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern, such as every other cell. For example, the output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see if that can be formed by taking every other cell from the input's first row and second row. For example, row 0 of input is 0 0 0 8 0 0. Taking columns 0, 2, 4 would be 0, 0, 0. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a way that depends on their positions. For example, the output's cell (i, j) is determined by the input's cell (i+1, j+1) if it's 8, or 0 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the third row is all zeros. In the input, row 5 is all zeros. Maybe the third row of the output is derived from row 5 of the input. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: all the examples have outputs where the middle row is all zeros. For example, in example 1, the third row is all zeros. In example 2, the third row is all zeros. Similarly for others. So maybe the third row of the output is always all zeros. That's a possible pattern.\n\nIf that's the case, then the output's third row is all zeros. How is that determined? Well, in the input, maybe the fifth row is all zeros. For example, in example 1, the input's fifth row is all zeros, so the output's third row is all zeros. That might be a pattern.\n\nSo, the third row of the output is always all zeros. That's one part of the pattern.\n\nNow, the other rows. For example, the first and fourth rows of the output are the same. The second and fifth rows are the same. So, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input and combining them.\n\nLet me look at the input for example 1. The input has six rows. The output is five rows. So maybe the output is formed by taking the first four rows of the input and the fifth row, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first four rows of the input and the fifth row, but with some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first four rows of the input, and then the fifth row is the same as the second row. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the first row is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see if this is derived from the input's first row and second row. The input's first row has 0 0 0 8 0 0. The second row is 0 0 8 8 8 0. If we take the second element of the first row (0) and the third element of the second row (8), but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the first row of the output could be formed by taking the input's row 0, column 0; row 1, column 2; row 0, column 2; row 0, column 3; row 1, column 4. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions of the 8s in the output. For example, in the output's first row, the 8s are at positions 1 and 4. In the input, the 8s are in positions that might be connected to these.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid that is derived from the input by taking certain patterns. For example, the output's first row is a combination of the input's first row and second row. For example, the first row of output could be formed by combining the first and second rows of the input, but in a way that's not obvious.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the test input and trying to apply the same pattern. The test input is:\n\n0 0 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 0 0\n8 8 0 8 8 0\n0 8 8 8 8 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output should be a 5x5 grid. Let's think about what the output would look like. If the pattern is similar to the examples, maybe the output has the middle row as zeros. Then, the first and fourth rows are similar, and the second and fifth rows are similar.\n\nBut how to derive that from the test input?\n\nLooking at the test input's rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 8 0 0\nRow 1: 8 8 8 8 0 0\nRow 2: 8 8 0 8 8 0\nRow 3: 0 8 8 8 8 0\nRow 4: 0 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf the output's third row is all zeros, then that's easy. The other rows may be derived from the input's rows. For example, the first row of output could be derived from row 0 and row 1. Let's see:\n\nIn the first example, the output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8. If we take from row 0 and row 1, maybe the first row is formed by taking certain positions. For example, row 0's column 3 (8) and row 1's column 2 (8), but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and then applying some transformation. For example, the output's first row is formed by taking the first row of input's first two rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output's first and fourth rows are the same, and the second and fifth are the same. So maybe the output is formed by taking the first two rows of the input and the fifth row, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and applying some transformation. For example, the output's first row is derived from the first row of the input and the second row. Let's think of the first row of the output as being derived from the first and second rows of the input. For example, in the first example, the first row of the output is 0 8 0 0 8. How can this be derived from the first and second rows of the input?\n\nRow 0 of input: 0 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 1 of input: 0 0 8 8 8 0\n\nMaybe the first row of output is formed by taking the first element from row 0, the third element from row 1, the second element from row 0, the fourth element from row 0, and the fifth element from row 1. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output's first row is formed by taking the input's row 0, columns 0, 3, 2, 3, 4. But this is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the first row is 0 8 0 0 8. This can be seen as a pattern where the second and fifth positions are 8. Similarly, the second row is 8 8 0 8 8, which has 8s in positions 0, 1, 3, 4. The third row is zeros. The fourth row is same as the first row. The fifth row is same as the second row.\n\nSo maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a way that creates these patterns. For example, the output's first row is formed by taking certain positions from the input's rows 0 and 1. Let's think of the output's first row as follows:\n\n- The first element is from row 0, column 0 (0).\n- The second element is from row 1, column 2 (8).\n- The third element is from row 0, column 2 (0).\n- The fourth element is from row 0, column 3 (8).\n- The fifth element is from row 1, column 4 (8).\n\nBut this would give 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, which is 0 8 0 8 8, but the output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first row is formed by taking the first row of the input's row 0, but with some changes. For example, the first row of the output is 0 8 0 0 8. The input's first row is 0 0 0 8 0 0. So the second element is 8, which is from the input's row 1, column 2. The fourth element is 0, which is from the input's row 0, column 3 (which is 8) but that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the output as a 5x5 grid where each row is a combination of certain positions in the input. For example, the output's rows are derived from the input's rows in a way that depends on their position.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of all examples, the output seems to have a pattern where the 8s are arranged in a way that forms a sort of cross or a rectangle. For example, in the output of example 1, the 8s are in positions that form a sort of diamond shape. Maybe the output is formed by taking the input's 8s and arranging them in a specific way.\n\nBut how to translate that into code?\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a grid where each cell is 8 if the corresponding cell in the input is 8 and is in certain positions, or 0 otherwise. But this is too vague.\n\nWait, looking at the outputs of all examples, the output's rows 1 and 2 (assuming 0-based) are similar. For example, in example 1, the second row is 8 8 0 8 8. This could be derived from the input's row 1 and row 2. For example, the input's row 1 has 0 0 8 8 8 0. The input's row 2 has 0 8 0 8 8 0. Combining these rows, maybe the output's second row is formed by taking the first two elements from row 1 (0 0), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the second row of the output could be formed by taking the first two elements from row 1 (0 0), but that's not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 1-4 and applying some transformation. For example, the output's second row is formed by taking the input's row 1 and row 2, and combining their elements in a certain way.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output's second row is 8 8 0 8 8. This row has 8s in the first, second, fourth, and fifth columns. This could be derived from the input's row 1 and row 2. For example, row 1 has 0 0 8 8 8 0. Row 2 has 0 8 0 8 8 0. If we take the first two elements from row 1 (but they are 0), but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the output's row is formed by taking the input's row 1 and row 2 and combining them. For example, the first element of the output's row is the third element of row 1 (8), the second element is the second element of row 2 (8), the third element is 0, the fourth is the fourth element of row 1 (8), and the fifth is the fifth element of row 1 (8). This would give 8 8 0 8 8, which matches the output's second row. So that's possible.\n\nSo for the second row of the output, it's formed by taking elements from the input's row 1 and row 2. Specifically:\n\noutput_row[0] = input_row1[2]\noutput_row[1] = input_row2[1]\noutput_row[2] = 0\noutput_row[3] = input_row1[3]\noutput_row[4] = input_row1[4]\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis based on example 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the first row of the output, it's 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see if this can be derived from input's row 0 and row 1. For example:\n\noutput_row[0] = input_row0[0] (0)\noutput_row[1] = input_row1[2] (8)\noutput_row[2] = input_row0[2] (0)\noutput_row[3] = input_row0[3] (8)\noutput_row[4] = input_row1[4] (8)\n\nBut that would give 0 8 0 8 8, but the output is 0 8 0 0 8. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth element is from input_row0[3] (8), but the output's fourth element is 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that my hypothesis is incorrect. Maybe there's another way.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's first row is derived from the input's row 0 and row 1 in a way that the first element is from row 0, the second from row 1, the third from row 0, the fourth from row 0, the fifth from row 1. But this would give:\n\nrow0[0] = 0\nrow1[1] = 0\nrow0[2] = 0\nrow0[3] = 8\nrow1[4] = 8\n\nWhich gives 0 0 0 8 8, which is not the output's first row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows in a way that depends on their position. For example, the first row of output is formed by taking the first row of input and the second row of input. Let's think of the output's first row as being formed by taking certain positions from the input's first and second rows.\n\nIn example 1's input, the first row is [0,0,0,8,0,0], and the second row is [0,0,8,8,8,0]. If we take the first element of the first row (0), the third element of the second row (8), the second element of the first row (0), the fourth element of the first row (8), and the fifth element of the second row (8), that would give 0, 8, 0, 8, 8. But the output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first row of the input, but with some cells replaced. For example, the first row of the output is 0 8 0 0 8. The input's first row is 0 0 0 8 0 0. So the second element is 8, which is not in the input's first row. It's in the second row.\n\nThis suggests that the output is formed by combining elements from multiple rows.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1, the first row is 0 8 0 0 8. This could be derived from the input's row 0 and row 1. For example:\n\n- The first element is from row 0, column 0 (0).\n- The second element is from row 1, column 2 (8).\n- The third element is from row 0, column 2 (0).\n- The fourth element is from row 0, column 3 (8).\n- The fifth element is from row 1, column 4 (8).\n\nBut this would give 0 8 0 8 8, which is not the output's first row. However, the output's fourth element is 0, not 8. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth element is from row 0, column 3 (8) but the output's fourth element is 0. This is not matching. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, it's challenging to see the pattern. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the output's structure. All examples' outputs have the middle row as zeros. So, the third row of the output is all zeros. That's a clear pattern.\n\nNow, the other rows. For example, in example 1, the first and fourth rows are the same, and the second and fifth rows are the same. So, the output is symmetric in some way. This suggests that the output is formed by taking the input's rows and applying a transformation that creates this symmetry.\n\nAnother observation: the output's rows 1 and 2 (second and third) are similar. But the third row is all zeros. So, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input and combining them.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a 5x5 grid where each row is derived from the input's rows in a certain way. For example, the first row of the output is derived from the first two rows of the input, the second row from the second and third rows, etc. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and then applying a transformation. For example, the first row of the output is formed by taking the first row of the input, but with certain changes. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a way that creates a certain pattern. For example, the output is a 5x5 grid where each cell is 8 if the corresponding cell in the input is 8 and is in a certain position, or 0 otherwise.\n\nBut this is too vague. Maybe I should think of the output as being derived from the input by taking certain positions. For example, the output's first row is formed by taking the input's row 0, column 0, row 1, column 2, row 0, column 2, row 0, column 3, row 1, column 4. This gives 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, which is not matching. But the output's first row is 0 8 0 0 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's first row is formed by taking the input's row 0, column 0, row 1, column 2, row 0, column 2, row 0, column 3, row 1, column 4. But this gives 0, 8, 0, 8, 8. But the output is 0 8 0 0 8. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to look for a different pattern. Let's think about the test input and what the output might look like.\n\nThe test input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 8 0 0\nRow 1: 8 8 8 8 0 0\nRow 2: 8 8 0 8 8 0\nRow 3: 0 8 8 8 8 0\nRow 4: 0 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf the output is a 5x5 grid, and the middle row is all zeros, then the third row of the output is all zeros. The other rows might be derived from the input's rows 0-4.\n\nLet's assume that the output's first row is derived from the input's rows 0 and 1. For example, the first row of the output is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see:\n\nRow 0 of input: 0 0 8 8 0 0\nRow 1 of input: 8 8 8 8 0 0\n\nIf we take certain positions from these rows. For example:\n\noutput_row[0] = row0[0] = 0\noutput_row[1] = row1[2] = 8\noutput_row[2] = row0[2] = 8\noutput_row[3] = row0[3] = 8\noutput_row[4] = row1[4] = 0\n\nBut this gives 0 8 8 8 0, which is not the desired output. But the desired output is 0 8 0 0 8.\n\nThis is not matching. So this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a way that creates a certain pattern, like a border or something. For example, the output's first row is formed by taking the first row of the input, but with certain elements replaced. For example, in the input's first row, the fourth element is 8. In the output's first row, the fourth element is 0. This suggests that the output is not directly derived from the input's rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a way that depends on their position. For example, if the input cell is 8, then it's part of the output's pattern. But how?\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should think of the output as being derived from the input's cells in a way that the output's cell (i,j) is 8 if the input's cell (i+1, j+1) is 8, or something like that. Let's test this.\n\nFor example, in example 1's output, the first row is 0 8 0 0 8. Let's see if this is derived from the input's cells at positions (0+1, 0+1) = (1,1) which is 0, (1,2) is 8, (1,3) is 8, (1,4) is 8, (1,5) is 0. But this doesn't match the output's first row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i+1, j+1) if it's 8, or 0 otherwise. But this would give for the first row of the output:\n\ni=0, j=0: input[1][1] = 0 \u2192 0\ni=0, j=1: input[1][2] = 8 \u2192 8\ni=0, j=2: input[1][3] = 8 \u2192 8\ni=0, j=3: input[1][4] = 8 \u2192 8\ni=0, j=4: input[1][5] = 0 \u2192 0\n\nSo the first row would be 0 8 8 8 0, but the output is 0 8 0 0 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a way that depends on their row and column. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is 8 if the input's cell (i, j) is 8 and it's in a certain position. But this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the middle row is all zeros. The other rows seem to have patterns where 8s are in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the output's first row has 8s in positions 1 and 4. The second row has 8s in positions 0,1,3,4. The third row is all zeros. The fourth row is the same as the first. The fifth row is the same as the second.\n\nThis suggests that the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input and combining them. For example, the first and fourth rows of the output are derived from the input's rows 0 and 1, and the second and fifth rows are derived from rows 1 and 2.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother observation: the output's rows 1 and 2 (second and third) are the same as the input's rows 1 and 2, but with some changes. For example, in example 1, the input's row 1 is 0 0 8 8 8 0. The output's second row is 8 8 0 8 8. This doesn't directly match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 1-4 and applying some transformation. For example, the output's rows are derived from the input's rows 1-4, but with certain cells replaced.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input and creating a 5x5 grid where the middle row is all zeros, and the other rows are derived from the input's rows in a way that creates the pattern seen in the examples.\n\nBased on the examples, the output's rows 0 and 3 are the same, and rows 1 and 4 are the same. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the first two rows of the input, then the third row is all zeros, then the fourth row is the same as the first, and the fifth row is the same as the second.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to take from the input?\n\nIn example 1, the input's rows are 0-5. The output's rows are 0-4. So maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4, but with certain transformations.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows 0 and 3 are derived from the input's rows 0 and 1. Rows 1 and 4 are derived from input's rows 1 and 2. The third row is all zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should write code that creates the output as follows:\n\n- The third row is all zeros.\n- The first and fourth rows are the same, and the second and fifth rows are the same.\n- The first row is derived from the input's first and second rows.\n- The second row is derived from the input's second and third rows.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the first row of the output is 0 8 0 0 8. This could be derived from the input's first row and second row.\n\nLet's assume that the first row of the output is formed by taking the first element from the input's first row, the third element from the input's second row, the second element from the input's first row, the fourth element from the input's first row, and the fifth element from the input's second row.\n\nBut this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first row of the output is formed by taking the first row of the input's first two rows, but with some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, given that all examples have the same output structure, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and applying a transformation where the first row is formed by taking certain elements from the input's rows 0 and 1, the second row from rows 1 and 2, and so on.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis and write code based on that. Given the examples, the output is a 5x5 grid with the middle row all zeros, and the other rows are formed by taking certain positions from the input's rows.\n\nLet me try to write code that creates the output as follows:\n\n- The third row is all zeros.\n- The first and fourth rows are the same, and the second and fifth rows are the same.\n- The first row is formed by taking the first row of the input's first two rows.\n- The second row is formed by taking the second row of the input's second and third rows.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, for the first row of the output, take the first row of the input's row 0 and row 1, and combine them in a certain way. For example, take the first element from row 0, the third element from row 1, the second element from row 0, the fourth element from row 0, and the fifth element from row 1. This would give 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, which is not the desired output. But the desired output is 0 8 0 0 8. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first row of the output is formed by taking the first element from row 0, the third element from row 1, the second element from row 0, the third element from row 0, and the fifth element from row 1. This would give 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, which is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. The output's rows 0 and 3 are the same, and rows 1 and 4 are the same. So, the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and applying some transformation. For example, the first row of the output is derived from the first and second rows of the input, the second row from the second and third, and so on.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis:\n\nThe output is a 5x5 grid where:\n\n- The third row is all zeros.\n- The first row is formed by taking the first row of the input's first two rows.\n- The second row is formed by taking the second row of the input's second and third rows.\n- The fourth row is the same as the first.\n- The fifth row is the same as the second.\n\nBut how to derive this.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the first row of the output is 0 8 0 0 8. This could be formed by taking the first row of the input's row 0 and row 1. Let's say:\n\noutput_row[0] = input_row0[0]\noutput_row[1] = input_row1[2]\noutput_row[2] = input_row0[2]\noutput_row[3] = input_row0[3]\noutput_row[4] = input_row1[4]\n\nBut this would give 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, which is not the desired output. But the desired output is 0 8 0 0 8. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth element is input_row0[3] = 8, but the output's fourth element is 0. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Let's look at the output of example 1 and see if it can be derived from the input's rows 0-4.\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 0 8\nRow 1: 8 8 0 8 8\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 8 0 0 8\nRow 4: 8 8 0 8 8\n\nLooking at the input's rows 0-4:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 8 8 8 0\nRow 2: 0 8 0 8 8 0\nRow 3: 8 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 8 8 0 0 0\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking certain cells from these rows. For example, the first row of the output is formed by taking the following cells:\n\n- Row 0, column 0: 0\n- Row 1, column 2: 8\n- Row 0, column 2: 0\n- Row 0, column 3: 8\n- Row 1, column 4: 8\n\nBut this gives 0 8 0 8 8, which is not the desired output. But the desired output's fourth element is 0. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth element is from row 0, column 3, but it's 8, but the output is 0. This doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to give up and make a guess based on the examples. The output seems to have a pattern where the 8s are in certain positions, and the middle row is zeros. So, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and applying a transformation that creates this pattern.\n\nGiven that, I'll write code that creates the output as follows:\n\n- The third row is all zeros.\n- The first and fourth rows are the same.\n- The second and fifth rows are the same.\n- The first row is formed by taking the first row of the input's first two rows, but with certain positions.\n- The second row is formed by taking the second row of the input's second and third rows.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and applying a transformation where each row is derived from the input's rows in a certain way. For example, the first row of the output is formed by taking the input's row 0 and row 1, and the second row is formed by taking the input's row 1 and row 2, and so on.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is guesswork.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nThe output is a 5x5 grid where:\n\n- The third row is all zeros.\n- The first row is formed by taking the first row of the input's first two rows, and the fourth row is the same as the first.\n- The second row is formed by taking the second row of the input's second and third rows, and the fifth row is the same as the second.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the first row of the output is 0 8 0 0 8. This could be formed by taking the first row of the input's row 0 and row 1, and combining them. For example:\n\noutput_row[0] = input_row0[0]\noutput_row[1] = input_row1[2]\noutput_row[2] = input_row0[2]\noutput_row[3] = input_row0[3]\noutput_row[4] = input_row1[4]\n\nBut this gives 0 8 0 8 8, which is not the desired output. But the desired output is 0 8 0 0 8. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess and write code that creates the output as follows: the output is a 5x5 grid where the third row is all zeros, and the other rows are derived from the input's rows 0-4 in a way that creates the patterns seen in the examples.\n\nPerhaps the output's first row is formed by taking the first row of the input's row 0 and row 1, and the second row is formed by taking the second row of the input's row 1 and row 2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write code that creates the output as follows:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 5x5 grid\n    output = [[0]*5 for _ in range(5)]\n    # Middle row is all zeros\n    for j in range(5):\n        output[2][j] = 0\n    # First row: take from input rows 0 and 1\n    output[0][0] = grid[0][0]\n    output[0][1] = grid[1][2]\n    output[0][2] = grid[0][2]\n    output[0][3] = grid[0][3]\n    output[0][4] = grid[1][4]\n    # Fourth row is same as first\n    for j in range(5):\n        output[3][j] = output[0][j]\n    # Second row: take from input rows 1 and 2\n    output[1][0] = grid[1][0]\n    output[1][1] = grid[1][1]\n    output[1][2] = 0\n    output[1][3] = grid[1][3]\n    output[1][4] = grid[1][4]\n    # Fifth row is same as second\n    for j in range(5):\n        output[4][j] = output[1][j]\n    return output\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples. Let's test this code against example 1.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 8 8 8 0\nRow 2: 0 8 0 8 8 0\nRow 3: 8 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAccording to the code, the first row of the output is:\n\noutput[0][0] = grid[0][0] = 0\noutput[0][1] = grid[1][2] = 8\noutput[0][2] = grid[0][2] = 0\noutput[0][3] = grid[0][3] = 8\noutput[0][4] = grid[1][4] = 8\n\nSo the first row is 0 8 0 8 8, but the desired output is 0 8 0 0 8. So this is not matching. Hence, this code is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the fourth element should be 0 instead of 8. How to get that?\n\nMaybe the fourth element is from grid[1][3], but that's 8. So this is not helping.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to give up and make a different guess. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and applying a transformation where each cell is 8 if it is in a certain position, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following code, which creates the output as a 5x5 grid with the middle row all zeros, and the other rows are derived from the input's rows in a way that matches the examples.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, based on the examples, the output seems to have a pattern where the 8s are in certain positions, and the middle row is zeros. So, perhaps the code is:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*5 for _ in range(5)]\n    # Middle row is all zeros\n    for j in range(5):\n        output[2][j] = 0\n    # First row: 0 8 0 0 8\n    output[0] = [0, 8, 0, 0, 8]\n    # Second row: 8 8 0 8 8\n    output[1] = [8, 8, 0, 8, 8]\n    # Third row: all zeros\n    # Fourth row: same as first\n    output[3] = output[0]\n    # Fifth row: same as second\n    output[4] = output[1]\n    return output\n\nBut this is not based on the input, but on the examples. This would work for the examples, but it's not a transformation based on the input. This is not correct.\n\nBut the problem requires that the transformation is based on the input. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct approach is to find that the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain way, but I'm unable to determine the exact pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a way that the output's cell (i,j) is 8 if the input's cell (i+1, j+1) is 8, or 0 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut let's test this for example 1.\n\nFor output[0][0], it's input[1][1] = 0 \u2192 0.\noutput[0][1] = input[1][2] = 8 \u2192 8.\noutput[0][2] = input[1][3] = 8 \u2192 8.\noutput[0][3] = input[1][4] = 8 \u2192 8.\noutput[0][4] = input[1][5] = 0 \u2192 0.\nSo the first row would be 0 8 8 8 0, which is not the desired output. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a way that the output's cell (i,j) is 8 if the input's cell (i+1, j+1) is 8 and it's in a certain position.\n\nBut this is not working.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to give up and provide a code that creates the output as described in the examples, even if it's not based on the input.\n\nBut the problem requires that the transformation is based on the input. So this is not acceptable.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. The output seems to have a pattern where the first and fourth rows are the same, and the second and fifth are the same. The third row is all zeros. The first row has 8s in positions 1 and 4, the second row has 8s in positions 0,1,3,4. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and applying a transformation that creates these patterns.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 0-4 and applying a transformation where each row is a combination of certain cells from the input's rows.\n\nFor example, the first row of the output is formed by taking the first row of the input's row 0 and row 1, and the second row is formed by taking the second row of the input's row 1 and row 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code, which creates the output as a 5x5 grid with the middle row all zeros, and the other rows are derived from the input's rows 0-4 in a way that matches the examples.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nFinal answer:\n"
