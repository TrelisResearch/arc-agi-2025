          "Analysis:\n\n- In training examples, input grids contain scattered colored points (values 1 to 4, ignoring 0 which is black).\n- Output grids reorganize these colored points into compact vertical bars at the left columns.\n- Each color seems assigned to a single column in the output:\n  - Example 1: colors 1,2,3,4 \u2192 columns 0,1,2,3 in output.\n  - Example 2: same pattern.\n  - Example 3: only colors 1,2,3,4 remain and aligned left bottom.\n- Rows appear filled from the bottom upward in each column with the corresponding color.\n- The vertical bars' heights equal the count of that color in the input.\n- The columns in output are always in order: 1,2,3,4 along columns 0,1,2,3.\n- Other columns and cells are zero.\n\nIn sum, the transformation extracts all nonzero colors (1-4), counts occurrences per color, and draws vertical \"bars\" of those counts aligned at left columns and bottom flush.\n\nFor the test input, it likely extracts colors 1 to 4 and builds the same bars but we do not output it here.\n\n---\n\nImplementation plan:\n\n- For colors 1,2,3,4:\n  - Count how many times each color appears in input grid.\n- Create an empty 10x10 zero grid.\n- For each color c in 1..4 with count k:\n  - Fill the column c-1 (0-based) bottom k cells with value c.\n- Return the filled grid.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Count occurrences of colors 1 to 4\n    counts = [0,0,0,0]  # index 0->color 1, index 3->color4\n    \n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if 1 <= val <=4:\n                counts[val-1] +=1\n                \n    # Create empty 10x10 grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # For each color c=1..4, fill column c-1 with that color vertically from bottom up\n    for color_index, count in enumerate(counts):\n        col = color_index\n        for i in range(count):\n            # row from bottom: 9 - i\n            transformed_grid[9 - i][col] = color_index + 1\n            \n    return transformed_grid\n```"
