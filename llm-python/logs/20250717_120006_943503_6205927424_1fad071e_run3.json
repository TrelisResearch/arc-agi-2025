    "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output is always a 1\u00d75 grid, and the values are 0 or 1. The output seems to be related to the positions of certain values in the input grid.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that the output seems to be determined by the positions of the value 2 in the input grid. The output seems to be a 1\u00d75 grid where each position corresponds to a column in the input grid, and the value is 1 if there are at least two 2s in that column, and 0 otherwise.\n\nLet me implement this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Count the number of 2s in each column\n    column_counts = [0] * 9\n    for row in grid:\n        for col in range(9):\n            if row[col] == 2:\n                column_counts[col] += 1\n    \n    # Create the output grid: 1 if column count >= 2, else 0\n    transformed_grid = [1 if count >= 2 else 0 for count in column_counts[:5]]\n    return [transformed_grid]\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Count the number of 2s in each column\n    column_counts = [0] * 9\n    for row in grid:\n        for col in range(9):\n            if row[col] == 2:\n                column_counts[col] += 1\n    \n    # Create the output grid: 1 if column count >= 2, else 0\n    transformed_grid = [1 if count >= 2 else 0 for count in column_counts[:5]]\n    return [transformed_grid]\n```",

The output seems to be related to the positions of certain values in the input grid.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that the output seems to be determined by the positions of the value 2 in the input grid. The output seems to be a 1\u00d75 grid where each position corresponds to a column in the input grid, and the value is 1 if there are at least two 2s in that column, and 0 otherwise.\n\nLet me implement this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Count the number of 2s in each column\n    column_counts = [0] * 9\n    for row in grid:\n        for col in range(9):\n            if row[col] == 2:\n                column_counts[col] += 1\n    \n    # Create the output grid: 1 if column count >= 2, else 0\n    transformed_grid = [1 if count >= 2 else 0 for count in column_counts[:5]]\n    return [transformed_grid]\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Count the number of 2s in each column\n    column_counts = [0] * 9\n    for row in grid:\n        for col in range(9):\n            if row[col] == 2:\n                column_counts[col] += 1\n    \n    # Create the output grid: 1 if column count >= 2, else 0\n    transformed_grid = [1 if count >= 2 else 0 for count in column_counts[:5]]\n    return [transformed_grid]\n```",
