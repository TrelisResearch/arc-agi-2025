Replacing `0` with `0`.\n2. Replacing `8` with `2`.\n\n### Implementation:\nLet's implement this hypothesis in Python.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [[2 if value == 8 else value for value in row] for row in grid]\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [[2 if value == 8 else value for value in row] for row in grid]\n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The function will iterate through the input grid and apply the observed transformations.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for value in row:\n            if value == 4:\n                new_row.append(2)\n            elif value == 5:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(value)\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each value in the input grid and applies the following rules:\n- If the value is 4, it is replaced with 2.\n- If the value is 5, it is replaced with 0.\n- If the value is anything else, it remains unchanged.\n\nThis transformation is a basic attempt to capture the observed patterns in the training examples.

Replacing `0` with `0`.\n2. Replacing `8` with `2`.\n\n### Implementation:\nLet's implement this hypothesis in Python.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [[2 if value == 8 else value for value in row] for row in grid]\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [[2 if value == 8 else value for value in row] for row in grid]\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
