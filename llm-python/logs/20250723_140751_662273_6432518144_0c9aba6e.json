The specific positions where 2 is replaced by 8 appear to be in a pattern that is consistent across examples but not identical.\n\nGiven these patterns, we can implement a transformation that replaces the number 2 with 8 in specific positions while keeping the bottom 7x4 section unchanged.\n\nHere's the Python function implementing this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Define the positions where 2 should be replaced with 8\n    replacement_positions = [\n        (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), \n        (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 1), (8, 2), \n        (9, 1), (9, 2), (10, 1), (10, 2), (11, 1), (11, 2), (12, 1), (12, 2)\n    ]\n    \n    # Create a copy of the input grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace the number 2 with 8 in the specified positions\n    for pos in replacement_positions:\n        row, col = pos\n        if grid[row][col] == 2:\n            transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis function replaces the number 2 with 8 in the specified positions while keeping the bottom 7x4 section unchanged.
