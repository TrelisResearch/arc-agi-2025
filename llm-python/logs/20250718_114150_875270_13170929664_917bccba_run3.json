              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid seems to be transforming the input grid by:\n   - Replacing certain values with 0s\n   - Creating new patterns where 3s and 2s are transformed into 0s and 3s\n   - Creating new patterns where 8s and 4s are transformed into 0s and 8s\n   - Creating new patterns where 6s are transformed into 0s and 6s\n\n2. There seems to be a pattern where:\n   - Values in the middle of the grid are transformed\n   - Values in the corners are preserved\n   - Values in the middle of rows and columns are transformed\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces certain values with 0s\n- Creates new patterns based on the position of the values\n- Preserves certain values in the corners\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation pattern\n    for row in range(12):\n        for col in range(12):\n            # If the cell is in the middle of the grid (not on the edge)\n            if 2 <= row <= 9 and 2 <= col <= 9:\n                # If the value is 3, replace with 0\n                if grid[row][col] == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 2, replace with 0 and 3\n                elif grid[row][col] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 8, replace with 0 and 8\n                elif grid[row][col] == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 4, replace with 0 and 4\n                elif grid[row][col] == 4:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 6, replace with 0 and 6\n                elif grid[row][col] == 6:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            # If the cell is in the middle of the grid (not on the edge)\n            elif 2 <= row <= 9 and 2 <= col <= 9:\n                # If the value is 3, replace with 0\n                if grid[row][col] == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 2, replace with 0 and 3\n                elif grid[row][col] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 8, replace with 0 and 8\n                elif grid[row][col] == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 4, replace with 0 and 4\n                elif grid[row][col] == 4:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 6, replace with 0 and 6\n                elif grid[row][col] == 6:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation pattern\n    for row in range(12):\n        for col in range(12):\n            # If the cell is in the middle of the grid (not on the edge)\n            if 2 <= row <= 9 and 2 <= col <= 9:\n                # If the value is 3, replace with 0\n                if grid[row][col] == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 2, replace with 0 and 3\n                elif grid[row][col] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 8, replace with 0 and 8\n                elif grid[row][col] == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 4, replace with 0 and 4\n                elif grid[row][col] == 4:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 6, replace with 0 and 6\n                elif grid[row][col] == 6:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            # If the cell is in the middle of the grid (not on the edge)\n            elif 2 <= row <= 9 and 2 <= col <= 9:\n                # If the value is 3, replace with 0\n                if grid[row][col] == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 2, replace with 0 and 3\n                elif grid[row][col] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 8, replace with 0 and 8\n                elif grid[row][col] == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 4, replace with 0 and 4\n                elif grid[row][col] == 4:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # If the value is 6, replace with 0 and 6\n                elif grid[row][col] == 6:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
