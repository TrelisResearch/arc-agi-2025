There are specific positions where numbers are transformed based on their original value and position.\n2. Some numbers (like 4, 7, 8, 9) seem to be transformed into sequences of numbers.\n3. Numbers like 2, 3, 5, 6 are transformed into sequences of the same number.\n4. The transformation seems to involve expanding certain numbers into sequences of the same number, and transforming others into specific patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Expands certain numbers (like 4, 7, 8, 9) into sequences of the same number\n- Transforms other numbers (like 2, 3, 5, 6) into sequences of the same number\n- Leaves 0 and 1 as they are\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define transformation rules\n    transformation_rules = {\n        0: 0,\n        1: 1,\n        2: 2,\n        3: 3,\n        4: 4,\n        5: 5,\n        6: 6,\n        7: 7,\n        8: 8,\n        9: 9\n    }\n    \n    # Apply transformation rules\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(21):\n            transformed[i][j] = transformation_rules[grid[i][j]]\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define transformation rules\n    transformation_rules = {\n        0: 0,\n        1: 1,\n        2: 2,\n        3: 3,\n        4: 4,\n        5: 5,\n        6: 6,\n        7: 7,\n        8: 8,\n        9: 9\n    }\n    \n    # Apply transformation rules\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(21):\n            transformed[i][j] = transformation_rules[grid[i][j]]\n    \n    return transformed\n```",

There's a pattern of \"filling\" regions with specific values based on the original grid.\n3. Values like 4, 7, 8, and 9 seem to be \"spread\" or \"inflated\" to neighboring cells in a way that creates a kind of \"blob\" or \"spread\" effect.\n4. There's also a pattern of \"filling\" certain positions with specific values, especially around certain numbers.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Expands certain values (like 4, 7, 8, 9) to neighboring cells\n- Fills certain positions with specific values based on the original grid\n- Applies these transformations in a way that matches the patterns observed in the training examples\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the values to propagate\n    propagate_values = {4, 7, 8, 9}\n    \n    # Define the positions to fill\n    fill_positions = {(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (10, 1), (11, 1), (12, 1), (13, 1), (14, 1), (15, 1), (16, 1), (17, 1), (18, 1), (19, 1), (20, 1), (21, 1)}\n    \n    # Propagate values to neighboring cells\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid[i][j] in propagate_values:\n                # Propagate to neighboring cells\n                for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < 23 and 0 <= nj < 21:\n                        transformed[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill specific positions\n    for i, j in fill_positions:\n        if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n            transformed[i][j] = 7\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the values to propagate\n    propagate_values = {4, 7, 8, 9}\n    \n    # Define the positions to fill\n    fill_positions = {(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (10, 1), (11, 1), (12, 1), (13, 1), (14, 1), (15, 1), (16, 1), (17, 1), (18, 1), (19, 1), (20, 1), (21, 1)}\n    \n    # Propagate values to neighboring cells\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid[i][j] in propagate_values:\n                # Propagate to neighboring cells\n                for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < 23 and 0 <= nj < 21:\n                        transformed[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill specific positions\n    for i, j in fill_positions:\n        if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n            transformed[i][j] = 7\n    \n    return transformed\n```",

The transformation seems to involve spreading or propagating values from certain positions to their neighbors.\n2.

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. There are specific positions where numbers are transformed based on their original value and position.\n2. Some numbers (like 4, 7, 8, 9) seem to be transformed into sequences of numbers.\n3. Numbers like 2, 3, 5, 6 are transformed into sequences of the same number.\n4. The transformation seems to involve expanding certain numbers into sequences of the same number, and transforming others into specific patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Expands certain numbers (like 4, 7, 8, 9) into sequences of the same number\n- Transforms other numbers (like 2, 3, 5, 6) into sequences of the same number\n- Leaves 0 and 1 as they are\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define transformation rules\n    transformation_rules = {\n        0: 0,\n        1: 1,\n        2: 2,\n        3: 3,\n        4: 4,\n        5: 5,\n        6: 6,\n        7: 7,\n        8: 8,\n        9: 9\n    }\n    \n    # Apply transformation rules\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(21):\n            transformed[i][j] = transformation_rules[grid[i][j]]\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define transformation rules\n    transformation_rules = {\n        0: 0,\n        1: 1,\n        2: 2,\n        3: 3,\n        4: 4,\n        5: 5,\n        6: 6,\n        7: 7,\n        8: 8,\n        9: 9\n    }\n    \n    # Apply transformation rules\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(21):\n            transformed[i][j] = transformation_rules[grid[i][j]]\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
