          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 12x10. The input has some numbers, and the output seems to have some numbers in different positions. Let me compare the input and output for that example.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, the first few rows have some numbers. The output has the same numbers in some positions but also adds new numbers. For instance, in the 6th row of the input, it's all zeros. In the output, the 6th row becomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. Then the 7th row in the output is 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 1 0 0. Wait, maybe there's some kind of mirroring or replication?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has some numbers in the third and fourth rows. The output seems to have those numbers copied to other rows. For example, the third row in the input is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output has the same row. But then in the seventh row of the output, there's 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0. So maybe some kind of vertical mirroring or replication?\n\nIn Example 3, the input has some numbers in the first few rows. The output seems to have some numbers in new positions. For example, the fourth row in the input is 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0. The output has that same row. But then in the fifth row of the output, there's 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe some kind of expansion or replication of certain patterns?\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is about copying certain patterns from the input to other positions. Let me think about possible patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have some numbers that are in the same positions as the input, but also new numbers. Maybe the transformation is to replicate certain patterns in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 6th row in the input is all zeros, but in the output, the 6th row has a 3 in the 7th column. Then the 7th row in the output has a 1 and 3 in the 6th and 7th columns. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are mirrored or duplicated in specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 2, the input has some numbers in the third row. The output has those numbers in the same row, but then in the seventh row, there's a 3 and 3, which might be a mirrored version of the third row's 3 and 3. Similarly, the fourth row in the input has 2 and 2, and in the output, the eighth row has 2 and 2. Maybe the pattern is that certain rows are mirrored or duplicated in other rows.\n\nAnother approach: look for positions where numbers are replicated. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 3 in the 7th column of row 6. The input's row 6 is all zeros. But maybe that 3 comes from some other part of the input. Wait, in the input, row 5 has a 7 and 2. In the output, row 6 has a 3, and row 7 has 1 and 3. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers are copied to certain positions based on their original positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding certain patterns. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 6, column 3. The output has a 5 in row 6, column 3. But in the output, row 7 has a 2 in column 4. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where numbers are copied to certain positions based on their original positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have numbers that are in the same positions as the input, but also some new numbers. Maybe the new numbers are generated based on the original numbers. For instance, in the output, the 6th row has a 3. Maybe that's derived from the input's row 5, which has a 7 and 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about mirroring certain patterns. For example, in Example 2, the third row has 3 and 3. The output's seventh row has 3 and 3. Maybe that's a mirrored version. Similarly, the fourth row in input has 2 and 2, and the eighth row in output has 2 and 2. So maybe the pattern is that certain rows are mirrored in other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replicating certain patterns in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3. That 3 might be a copy of a 3 from the input's row 5. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 3 in row 6, column 7. Maybe that's because the input's row 5 has a 7 and 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to copy certain patterns to specific positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7. Maybe that's because the input's row 5 has a 7 in column 4, and then that 7 is transformed into a 3. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a mirror image of certain parts of the grid. For example, in Example 2, the third row has 3 and 3, and the seventh row has 3 and 3. So maybe that's a vertical mirroring. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3's input and output. The input's row 6 has a 5 in column 3. The output's row 6 has the same. But in the output's row 7, there's a 2 in column 4. The input's row 4 has 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0. So maybe the 2 is copied to row 7. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand certain patterns. For example, in Example 3, the input's row 4 has 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0. The output's row 4 is the same. But then in the output's row 5, there's 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe the 1 comes from the input's row 6, column 3 (which is 5). But that's not matching.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the positions where numbers are present. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7. The input's row 5 has a 7 in column 4. Maybe that's a transformation where the 7 is converted to a 3? But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror certain numbers. For example, in Example 2, the third row has 3 and 3. The seventh row has 3 and 3. Maybe that's a vertical mirroring. But the input's third row is in the third row, and the output's seventh row is mirrored. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to copy certain numbers to specific positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7. That could be because the input's row 5 has a 7 in column 4. Maybe the 7 is transformed into a 3. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, if a number is in a certain row and column, then it's copied to another row and column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where certain patterns are replicated. For example, in Example 2, the third row has 3 and 3. The output's seventh row has 3 and 3. So maybe that's a vertical mirroring. Similarly, the fourth row in the input has 2 and 2, and the eighth row in the output has 2 and 2. So maybe the pattern is that the rows are mirrored in certain positions. For example, row 3 is mirrored in row 7, row 4 in row 8, etc.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nInput rows 3 and 4 have certain patterns. The output rows 7 and 8 have similar patterns. So maybe the rows are mirrored in the grid. For example, row 3 is mirrored in row 7 (which is 6 rows below?), but that depends on the grid size. Wait, the input is 12 rows. So row 3 is mirrored in row 9 (since 12 - 3 + 1 = 10, but maybe not). Alternatively, maybe the rows are mirrored in the middle. For example, row 3 and row 10 (since 12-3+1=10?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror certain parts of the grid. For example, in Example 2, the third row is copied to the seventh row, and the fourth row is copied to the eighth row. So maybe the pattern is that rows are mirrored in certain positions.\n\nBut how does that apply to other examples? Let's check Example 1. The output has some new rows. For example, row 6 in the output has a 3 in column 7. Maybe that's a copy of some other row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replicate certain patterns in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3. That could be a copy of the input's row 5, which has a 7 and 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where certain numbers are expanded. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 6, column 3. The output has that same 5. Then in row 7, there's a 2 in column 4. The input's row 4 has a 2 in column 5. Maybe that's a copy.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. For example, if a cell has a value, then certain other cells are set to that value based on their position.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where numbers are added. For example, in Example 1, the output has some new numbers in certain positions. Let me look at the output for Example 1:\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 \u2192 the 3 is in column 7.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 1 0 0 \u2192 the 1 and 3 are in columns 6 and 7.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 \u2192 the 4 and 4 are in columns 5 and 6.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 \u2192 1 in column 7.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 0 0 \u2192 7 and 2 in columns 7 and 8.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is to take certain numbers from the input and replicate them in specific positions. For example, the 3 in row 6, column 7 might be from the input's row 5, column 4 (which is 7), but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to create a grid where certain patterns are mirrored. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3, which is in the same column as the input's row 5's 7. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, if a number is in a certain position, then it's mirrored in another position. For instance, in Example 2, the third row has 3 and 3. The seventh row has 3 and 3. So maybe that's a vertical mirroring. The third row is mirrored in the seventh row. Similarly, the fourth row is mirrored in the eighth row.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each row i, there's a mirrored row at position (12 - i + 1) or something like that. But how?\n\nLet me think about the grid size. The input and output are 12x10. So rows are 0-11, columns 0-9.\n\nIn Example 2, the third row (index 2) has 3 and 3. The seventh row (index 6) has 3 and 3. 12 - 2 - 1 = 9? Not sure. Wait, maybe the mirrored row is 11 - i. For example, for row 2, 11-2=9. But that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's 12 - i -1. For row 2, 12-2-1=9. But in the output, the mirrored row is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are mirrored in the middle. For example, row 3 and row 9 (since 12/2 is 6, so 3 is 3 rows from the top, 9 is 3 rows from the bottom). But in Example 2, the output's row 7 is mirrored. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are mirrored in pairs. For example, row 3 and row 7. That's 3 and 7, which are 4 rows apart. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to copy certain patterns to other rows. For example, in Example 2, the third row is copied to the seventh row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the numbers in certain rows and replicate them in other rows. For example, in Example 2, the third row is copied to the seventh row. The fourth row is copied to the eighth row. So maybe the rows are mirrored in some way.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the transformation is to mirror certain rows. For example, for rows that have certain patterns, they are mirrored in other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the numbers in certain positions and replicate them in other positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 3 in row 6, column 7. Maybe that's because the input's row 5, column 4 is 7. But how does that relate?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where certain numbers are expanded. For example, in Example 3, the input's row 4 has 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0. The output's row 4 is the same. But then, in the output's row 5, there's 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe that's a copy of the input's row 6, column 3 (which is 5). But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take certain numbers and replicate them in specific positions. For example, in Example 3, the output's row 5 has a 1 in column 3. The input's row 6 has a 5 in column 3. So maybe that's a transformation where 5 becomes 1. But that's arbitrary.\n\nHmm, this is really challenging. Maybe I should look for patterns in the positions of the numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7. The input's row 5 has a 7 in column 4. Maybe that's a transformation where the 7 is replaced by 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror the numbers in certain ways. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7, which is the same as the input's row 5, column 4. But that's not a direct mirror. Wait, column 7 is 7, and column 4 is 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where the numbers are mirrored in certain positions. For example, in Example 2, the third row's 3 and 3 are mirrored in the seventh row. So maybe that's a vertical mirroring. If the grid is mirrored vertically, then row 3 would be mirrored in row 9 (since 12 - 3 - 1 = 8?), but that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take certain patterns and replicate them in other parts of the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 3 in row 6, column 7. That could be because the input has a 7 in row 5, column 4. Maybe the 7 is transformed into 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the numbers in certain positions and expand them. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 6, column 3. The output has a 5 in the same position. But in row 7, there's a 2 in column 4. The input's row 4 has a 2 in column 5. So maybe that's a copy of the input's row 4, column 5 to the output's row 7, column 4. But how?\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. For example, for each cell (i,j), if the cell has a value, then certain other cells are set to that value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where certain patterns are mirrored in specific ways. For example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row. So for each row i, the mirrored row is at position 12 - i - 1. Let's check:\n\nFor row 2 (third row), 12 - 2 - 1 = 9. But the mirrored row is 6. That doesn't fit. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirrored row is 12 - i. For row 2, 12-2=10. But the output's row 6 is not 10. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror certain rows. For example, rows 3 and 7 are mirrored. So row 3 is mirrored in row 7. So for each cell (i,j), if it's in row 3, then the mirrored cell is in row 7, same column. But how?\n\nIn Example 2, the third row has 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The seventh row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0. So the third row's columns 2 and 3 (3 and 3) are mirrored to the seventh row's columns 6 and 7 (3 and 3). So the mirrored positions are (i,j) and (i', j'), where i' is 7 and j' is 6 - j? Or something like that.\n\nWait, for the third row, columns 2 and 3 are 3 and 3. In the seventh row, columns 6 and 7 are 3 and 3. So the j positions are mirrored around the middle of the columns. Since there are 10 columns, the middle is between 4 and 5. So for column j in row 3, the mirrored column would be 9 - j. Let's check:\n\nFor j=2: 9-2=7. But in the seventh row, the mirrored column is 6. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's 9 - j - 1. For j=2: 9-2-1=6. Yes, that would give 6. So the mirrored column is 9-j-1 = 8-j. So for row 3, column 2 (j=2) is mirrored to row 7, column 8-2=6. Which matches the example.\n\nSimilarly, for j=3: 8-3=5. But in the seventh row, the 3 is at column 7. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirrored column is 9-j. For j=2, 9-2=7. But in the seventh row, the 3 is at column 6. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirrored column is 9 - j. For j=2, 9-2=7, but in the seventh row, the column is 6. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirrored row is 7, and the mirrored column is 9 - j. For j=2: 9-2=7. But the seventh row's column is 6. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of mirroring certain parts of the grid. For example, in Example 2, the third and seventh rows are mirrored in a certain way. Similarly, the fourth and eighth rows are mirrored.\n\nBut how to implement that in code?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take certain rows and mirror them in other rows. For example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row. So for each cell (i,j) in row 3, we copy it to row 7, column 9-j. But how?\n\nIf that's the case, then for each cell in row 3, we would copy it to row 7, column 9-j. Let's check:\n\nIn row 3, column 2 is 3. Copy to row 7, column 9-2=7. But in the output, row 7, column 7 is 1. Wait, that doesn't match. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirrored row is 7, and the mirrored column is 9-j. For row 3, column 2 (value 3) is mirrored to row 7, column 9-2=7. But in the output's row 7, column 7 is 1. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: look for the positions where the numbers are present in the output and see if they are related to the input. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7. The input's row 5 has a 7 in column 4. Maybe there's a pattern where the number in the input's row i, column j is transformed into a number in row i+1, column j+3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the 7 in row 5, column 4 is replaced with a 3 in row 6, column 7. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where certain patterns are replicated. For example, the output's row 6 has a 3, which is the same as the input's row 5, column 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand certain patterns. For example, in Example 3, the input's row 4 has 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0. The output's row 4 is the same. But in the output's row 5, there's 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe that 1 is derived from the input's row 6, column 3 (which is 5). But that's not clear.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of mirroring and replication. For example, certain rows are mirrored in other rows, and certain columns are mirrored in other columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to copy certain patterns to new positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7, which is the same as the input's row 5, column 4. But how?\n\nAnother approach: think of the transformation as a combination of the following steps:\n\n1. For each cell in the input grid, if it's a certain value, then certain other cells are set to that value.\n2. Or, for each cell, if it's in a certain position, then it's copied to another position.\n\nBut without seeing more examples, it's hard to find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where certain numbers are replicated in certain ways. For example, in Example 2, the third row is copied to the seventh row. So the code could be to copy rows 3 and 7, 4 and 8, etc.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to copy certain rows to other positions. For example, in Example 2, the third row is copied to the seventh row. Similarly, the fourth row is copied to the eighth row. So the code could be to mirror certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to mirror?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to copy certain rows to other rows based on their position. For example, rows 3 and 7 are mirrored, rows 4 and 8 are mirrored, etc.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each row i, if i is 3, then copy it to row 7. Similarly for row 4 to row 8, etc.\n\nBut how to implement that?\n\nFor example, in code:\n\nfor i in range(12):\n    if i == 2:  # row 3 (0-based is 2)\n        copy_row = 6  # row 7 (0-based is 6)\n        for j in range(10):\n            output[copy_row][j] = input[i][j]\n    elif i == 3:\n        copy_row = 7\n        for j in range(10):\n            output[copy_row][j] = input[i][j]\n    # and so on for other rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to copy?\n\nIn Example 2, the input's rows 2 (third row) and 3 (fourth row) are copied to rows 6 (seventh row) and 7 (eighth row). So for i=2, copy to 6; for i=3, copy to 7.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe for rows 2 and 3, copy them to rows 6 and 7. But that's just for Example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are mirrored in the middle of the grid. For example, row 2 is mirrored in row 9 (since 12-2-1=9), but in Example 2, the mirrored row is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take certain rows and mirror them in the grid. For example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row. So the code would be to copy row 2 to row 6.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to copy?\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of mirroring certain rows and columns, and replication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror the grid vertically. For example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row. So the code would be to mirror the grid vertically, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother idea: look for the positions where the numbers are added. In Example 1, the output has new numbers in rows 6,7,8,9,10. For example, row 6 has a 3, row 7 has 1 and 3, row 8 has 4 and 4, row 9 has 1, row 10 has 7 and 2.\n\nThese numbers seem to be derived from the input's rows. For example, row 6's 3 might be from row 5's 7. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7. That could be because the input's row 5 has a 7 in column 4. So 7 is transformed into 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with their mirrored values. For example, 7 becomes 3, 2 becomes 1, etc. But that's arbitrary.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, maybe I should try to implement a transformation that mirrors certain rows and columns, as seen in the examples.\n\nFor example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row. So the code would copy row 2 to row 6, and row 3 to row 7.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the sixth row is all zeros, but in the output, it has a 3. Maybe that's a copy of some other row.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror the grid vertically. For example, the first row is mirrored in the last row, the second row in the second last, etc. But in Example 2, the third row is not mirrored in the ninth row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror the grid horizontally. For example, the first column is mirrored in the last column. But in Example 2, the third row has 3 in column 2, and the seventh row has 3 in column 6. So that's a mirror around the middle column.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each cell (i,j), the mirrored cell is (i, 9-j). So for j=2, the mirrored column is 9-2=7. But in Example 2, the seventh row has 3 in column 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirrored column is 9-j-1. For j=2, 9-2-1=6, which matches the seventh row's column 6.\n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if it's in a certain row, it's mirrored to (i, 9-j-1).\n\nBut how does this apply to the examples?\n\nIn Example 2, the third row (i=2) has 3 in column 2. The mirrored column is 9-2-1=6. So the mirrored cell is (2,6). But in the output, the seventh row (i=6) has 3 in column 6. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Given the time, I'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to mirror certain rows and columns. For example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row, and the fourth row is mirrored in the eighth row. So the code would copy row 2 to row 6, and row 3 to row 7.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the sixth row is all zeros, but in the output, it has a 3. Maybe that's a copy of some other row.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe the code would look like this:\n\n- For each row i in the input, if i is in [2,3], copy it to row 6 and 7 respectively.\n\nBut this is just for Example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is to mirror certain rows. For example, for rows 2 and 3, copy them to rows 6 and 7.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, the code could be to mirror the grid vertically, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother approach: look for the output in Example 1. The output has some new numbers in certain positions. For example, in row 6, column 7 is 3. In the input, row 5, column 4 is 7. Maybe the 3 is derived from 7 by subtracting 4? 7-4=3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the 3 is the same as the input's row 5, column 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in the output, the 3 in row 6, column 7 is the same as the input's row 5, column 4. So the code would copy the input's row 5, column 4 to the output's row 6, column 7.\n\nBut how to determine this pattern?\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I'll try to write a function that mirrors certain rows and columns based on the examples.\n\nFor example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row. So the code could be to mirror rows 2 and 3 to rows 6 and 7.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the sixth row is all zeros, but in the output, it has a 3. Maybe that's a copy of some other row.\n\nBut I'm not sure. So perhaps the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Mirror rows 2 and 3 to rows 6 and 7\n    for i in range(10):\n        transformed[6][i] = grid[2][i]\n        transformed[7][i] = grid[3][i]\n    # Mirror other rows if needed\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just for Example 2. However, this would not handle the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror the grid vertically, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 6, column 3. The output has the same. But in row 7, there's a 2 in column 4. The input's row 4 has a 2 in column 5. So maybe the code is to copy certain rows.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: the transformation is to mirror certain rows and columns. For example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row. So the code would copy row 2 to row 6, and row 3 to row 7.\n\nFor the other examples, I'll assume that similar mirroring is happening.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Mirror rows 2 and 3 to rows 6 and 7\n    for j in range(10):\n        transformed[6][j] = grid[2][j]\n        transformed[7][j] = grid[3][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would only handle Example 2. However, this might not be correct for other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to mirror the entire grid vertically. For example, each row i is mirrored in row 11 - i.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 2. For row 2 (third row), the mirrored row would be 11-2=9. But in the output, the mirrored row is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror the grid horizontally. For example, each column j is mirrored in column 9-j.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, in Example 2, the third row has 3 in column 2. The mirrored column would be 9-2=7. So the mirrored cell would be in column 7. But in the output's seventh row, column 7 is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that mirrors certain rows as seen in Example 2, and see if it works for the test input.\n\nBut the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 3 3 8 8 0 0 0\n\nThe output for this would need to be generated by the transformation. If the transformation is to mirror certain rows, then the third row (index 2) is 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So the mirrored row would be row 6 (index 6). But in the test input, row 6 is all zeros. So the code would copy the third row to row 6, which is 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. But the test input's row 6 is all zeros, so the transformed grid would have that row as 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. But I don't know what the actual output should be.\n\nBut since the test input is not part of the training examples, I can't know. So I have to make a guess based on the training examples.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the code that mirrors certain rows as seen in the examples.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the correct transformation is to mirror certain rows and columns. For example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row, and the fourth row in the eighth row. So the code would copy those rows.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Copy row 2 to row 6\n    for j in range(10):\n        transformed[6][j] = grid[2][j]\n    # Copy row 3 to row 7\n    for j in range(10):\n        transformed[7][j] = grid[3][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would handle Example 2. However, it might not handle other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has new rows. So perhaps this code is not sufficient.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code and see.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 12x10. The input has some numbers, and the output seems to have some numbers in different positions. Let me compare the input and output for that example.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, the first few rows have some numbers. The output has the same numbers in some positions but also adds new numbers. For instance, in the 6th row of the input, it's all zeros. In the output, the 6th row becomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. Then the 7th row in the output is 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 1 0 0. Wait, maybe there's some kind of mirroring or replication?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has some numbers in the third and fourth rows. The output seems to have those numbers copied to other rows. For example, the third row in the input is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output has the same row. But then in the seventh row of the output, there's 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0. So maybe some kind of vertical mirroring or replication?\n\nIn Example 3, the input has some numbers in the first few rows. The output seems to have some numbers in new positions. For example, the fourth row in the input is 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0. The output has that same row. But then in the fifth row of the output, there's 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe some kind of expansion or replication of certain patterns?\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is about copying certain patterns from the input to other positions. Let me think about possible patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have some numbers that are in the same positions as the input, but also new numbers. Maybe the transformation is to replicate certain patterns in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 6th row in the input is all zeros, but in the output, the 6th row has a 3 in the 7th column. Then the 7th row in the output has a 1 and 3 in the 6th and 7th columns. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are mirrored or duplicated in specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 2, the input has some numbers in the third row. The output has those numbers in the same row, but then in the seventh row, there's a 3 and 3, which might be a mirrored version of the third row's 3 and 3. Similarly, the fourth row in the input has 2 and 2, and in the output, the eighth row has 2 and 2. Maybe the pattern is that certain rows are mirrored or duplicated in other rows.\n\nAnother approach: look for positions where numbers are replicated. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 3 in the 7th column of row 6. The input's row 6 is all zeros. But maybe that 3 comes from some other part of the input. Wait, in the input, row 5 has a 7 and 2. In the output, row 6 has a 3, and row 7 has 1 and 3. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers are copied to certain positions based on their original positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding certain patterns. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 6, column 3. The output has a 5 in row 6, column 3. But in the output, row 7 has a 2 in column 4. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where numbers are copied to certain positions based on their original positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have numbers that are in the same positions as the input, but also some new numbers. Maybe the new numbers are generated based on the original numbers. For instance, in the output, the 6th row has a 3. Maybe that's derived from the input's row 5, which has a 7 and 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about mirroring certain patterns. For example, in Example 2, the third row has 3 and 3. The output's seventh row has 3 and 3. Maybe that's a mirrored version. Similarly, the fourth row in input has 2 and 2, and the eighth row in output has 2 and 2. So maybe the pattern is that certain rows are mirrored in other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replicating certain patterns in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3. That 3 might be a copy of a 3 from the input's row 5. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 3 in row 6, column 7. Maybe that's because the input's row 5 has a 7 and 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to copy certain patterns to specific positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7. Maybe that's because the input's row 5 has a 7 in column 4, and then that 7 is transformed into a 3. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a mirror image of certain parts of the grid. For example, in Example 2, the third row has 3 and 3, and the seventh row has 3 and 3. So maybe that's a vertical mirroring. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3's input and output. The input's row 6 has a 5 in column 3. The output's row 6 has the same. But in the output's row 7, there's a 2 in column 4. The input's row 4 has 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0. So maybe the 2 is copied to row 7. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand certain patterns. For example, in Example 3, the input's row 4 has 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0. The output's row 4 is the same. But then in the output's row 5, there's 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe the 1 comes from the input's row 6, column 3 (which is 5). But that's not matching.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the positions where numbers are present. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7. The input's row 5 has a 7 in column 4. Maybe that's a transformation where the 7 is converted to a 3? But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror certain numbers. For example, in Example 2, the third row has 3 and 3. The seventh row has 3 and 3. Maybe that's a vertical mirroring. But the input's third row is in the third row, and the output's seventh row is mirrored. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to copy certain numbers to specific positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7. That could be because the input's row 5 has a 7 in column 4. Maybe the 7 is transformed into a 3. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, if a number is in a certain row and column, then it's copied to another row and column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where certain patterns are replicated. For example, in Example 2, the third row has 3 and 3. The output's seventh row has 3 and 3. So maybe that's a vertical mirroring. Similarly, the fourth row in the input has 2 and 2, and the eighth row in the output has 2 and 2. So maybe the pattern is that the rows are mirrored in certain positions. For example, row 3 is mirrored in row 7, row 4 in row 8, etc.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nInput rows 3 and 4 have certain patterns. The output rows 7 and 8 have similar patterns. So maybe the rows are mirrored in the grid. For example, row 3 is mirrored in row 7 (which is 6 rows below?), but that depends on the grid size. Wait, the input is 12 rows. So row 3 is mirrored in row 9 (since 12 - 3 + 1 = 10, but maybe not). Alternatively, maybe the rows are mirrored in the middle. For example, row 3 and row 10 (since 12-3+1=10?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror certain parts of the grid. For example, in Example 2, the third row is copied to the seventh row, and the fourth row is copied to the eighth row. So maybe the pattern is that rows are mirrored in certain positions.\n\nBut how does that apply to other examples? Let's check Example 1. The output has some new rows. For example, row 6 in the output has a 3 in column 7. Maybe that's a copy of some other row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replicate certain patterns in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3. That could be a copy of the input's row 5, which has a 7 and 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where certain numbers are expanded. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 6, column 3. The output has that same 5. Then in row 7, there's a 2 in column 4. The input's row 4 has a 2 in column 5. Maybe that's a copy.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. For example, if a cell has a value, then certain other cells are set to that value based on their position.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where numbers are added. For example, in Example 1, the output has some new numbers in certain positions. Let me look at the output for Example 1:\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 \u2192 the 3 is in column 7.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 1 0 0 \u2192 the 1 and 3 are in columns 6 and 7.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 \u2192 the 4 and 4 are in columns 5 and 6.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 \u2192 1 in column 7.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 0 0 \u2192 7 and 2 in columns 7 and 8.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is to take certain numbers from the input and replicate them in specific positions. For example, the 3 in row 6, column 7 might be from the input's row 5, column 4 (which is 7), but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to create a grid where certain patterns are mirrored. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3, which is in the same column as the input's row 5's 7. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, if a number is in a certain position, then it's mirrored in another position. For instance, in Example 2, the third row has 3 and 3. The seventh row has 3 and 3. So maybe that's a vertical mirroring. The third row is mirrored in the seventh row. Similarly, the fourth row is mirrored in the eighth row.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each row i, there's a mirrored row at position (12 - i + 1) or something like that. But how?\n\nLet me think about the grid size. The input and output are 12x10. So rows are 0-11, columns 0-9.\n\nIn Example 2, the third row (index 2) has 3 and 3. The seventh row (index 6) has 3 and 3. 12 - 2 - 1 = 9? Not sure. Wait, maybe the mirrored row is 11 - i. For example, for row 2, 11-2=9. But that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's 12 - i -1. For row 2, 12-2-1=9. But in the output, the mirrored row is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are mirrored in the middle. For example, row 3 and row 9 (since 12/2 is 6, so 3 is 3 rows from the top, 9 is 3 rows from the bottom). But in Example 2, the output's row 7 is mirrored. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are mirrored in pairs. For example, row 3 and row 7. That's 3 and 7, which are 4 rows apart. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to copy certain patterns to other rows. For example, in Example 2, the third row is copied to the seventh row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the numbers in certain rows and replicate them in other rows. For example, in Example 2, the third row is copied to the seventh row. The fourth row is copied to the eighth row. So maybe the rows are mirrored in some way.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the transformation is to mirror certain rows. For example, for rows that have certain patterns, they are mirrored in other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the numbers in certain positions and replicate them in other positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 3 in row 6, column 7. Maybe that's because the input's row 5, column 4 is 7. But how does that relate?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where certain numbers are expanded. For example, in Example 3, the input's row 4 has 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0. The output's row 4 is the same. But then, in the output's row 5, there's 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe that's a copy of the input's row 6, column 3 (which is 5). But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take certain numbers and replicate them in specific positions. For example, in Example 3, the output's row 5 has a 1 in column 3. The input's row 6 has a 5 in column 3. So maybe that's a transformation where 5 becomes 1. But that's arbitrary.\n\nHmm, this is really challenging. Maybe I should look for patterns in the positions of the numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7. The input's row 5 has a 7 in column 4. Maybe that's a transformation where the 7 is replaced by 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror the numbers in certain ways. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7, which is the same as the input's row 5, column 4. But that's not a direct mirror. Wait, column 7 is 7, and column 4 is 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where the numbers are mirrored in certain positions. For example, in Example 2, the third row's 3 and 3 are mirrored in the seventh row. So maybe that's a vertical mirroring. If the grid is mirrored vertically, then row 3 would be mirrored in row 9 (since 12 - 3 - 1 = 8?), but that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take certain patterns and replicate them in other parts of the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 3 in row 6, column 7. That could be because the input has a 7 in row 5, column 4. Maybe the 7 is transformed into 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the numbers in certain positions and expand them. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 6, column 3. The output has a 5 in the same position. But in row 7, there's a 2 in column 4. The input's row 4 has a 2 in column 5. So maybe that's a copy of the input's row 4, column 5 to the output's row 7, column 4. But how?\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. For example, for each cell (i,j), if the cell has a value, then certain other cells are set to that value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where certain patterns are mirrored in specific ways. For example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row. So for each row i, the mirrored row is at position 12 - i - 1. Let's check:\n\nFor row 2 (third row), 12 - 2 - 1 = 9. But the mirrored row is 6. That doesn't fit. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirrored row is 12 - i. For row 2, 12-2=10. But the output's row 6 is not 10. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror certain rows. For example, rows 3 and 7 are mirrored. So row 3 is mirrored in row 7. So for each cell (i,j), if it's in row 3, then the mirrored cell is in row 7, same column. But how?\n\nIn Example 2, the third row has 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The seventh row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0. So the third row's columns 2 and 3 (3 and 3) are mirrored to the seventh row's columns 6 and 7 (3 and 3). So the mirrored positions are (i,j) and (i', j'), where i' is 7 and j' is 6 - j? Or something like that.\n\nWait, for the third row, columns 2 and 3 are 3 and 3. In the seventh row, columns 6 and 7 are 3 and 3. So the j positions are mirrored around the middle of the columns. Since there are 10 columns, the middle is between 4 and 5. So for column j in row 3, the mirrored column would be 9 - j. Let's check:\n\nFor j=2: 9-2=7. But in the seventh row, the mirrored column is 6. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's 9 - j - 1. For j=2: 9-2-1=6. Yes, that would give 6. So the mirrored column is 9-j-1 = 8-j. So for row 3, column 2 (j=2) is mirrored to row 7, column 8-2=6. Which matches the example.\n\nSimilarly, for j=3: 8-3=5. But in the seventh row, the 3 is at column 7. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirrored column is 9-j. For j=2, 9-2=7. But in the seventh row, the 3 is at column 6. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirrored column is 9 - j. For j=2, 9-2=7, but in the seventh row, the column is 6. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirrored row is 7, and the mirrored column is 9 - j. For j=2: 9-2=7. But the seventh row's column is 6. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of mirroring certain parts of the grid. For example, in Example 2, the third and seventh rows are mirrored in a certain way. Similarly, the fourth and eighth rows are mirrored.\n\nBut how to implement that in code?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take certain rows and mirror them in other rows. For example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row. So for each cell (i,j) in row 3, we copy it to row 7, column 9-j. But how?\n\nIf that's the case, then for each cell in row 3, we would copy it to row 7, column 9-j. Let's check:\n\nIn row 3, column 2 is 3. Copy to row 7, column 9-2=7. But in the output, row 7, column 7 is 1. Wait, that doesn't match. So that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirrored row is 7, and the mirrored column is 9-j. For row 3, column 2 (value 3) is mirrored to row 7, column 9-2=7. But in the output's row 7, column 7 is 1. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: look for the positions where the numbers are present in the output and see if they are related to the input. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7. The input's row 5 has a 7 in column 4. Maybe there's a pattern where the number in the input's row i, column j is transformed into a number in row i+1, column j+3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the 7 in row 5, column 4 is replaced with a 3 in row 6, column 7. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where certain patterns are replicated. For example, the output's row 6 has a 3, which is the same as the input's row 5, column 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand certain patterns. For example, in Example 3, the input's row 4 has 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0. The output's row 4 is the same. But in the output's row 5, there's 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe that 1 is derived from the input's row 6, column 3 (which is 5). But that's not clear.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of mirroring and replication. For example, certain rows are mirrored in other rows, and certain columns are mirrored in other columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to copy certain patterns to new positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7, which is the same as the input's row 5, column 4. But how?\n\nAnother approach: think of the transformation as a combination of the following steps:\n\n1. For each cell in the input grid, if it's a certain value, then certain other cells are set to that value.\n2. Or, for each cell, if it's in a certain position, then it's copied to another position.\n\nBut without seeing more examples, it's hard to find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where certain numbers are replicated in certain ways. For example, in Example 2, the third row is copied to the seventh row. So the code could be to copy rows 3 and 7, 4 and 8, etc.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to copy certain rows to other positions. For example, in Example 2, the third row is copied to the seventh row. Similarly, the fourth row is copied to the eighth row. So the code could be to mirror certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to mirror?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to copy certain rows to other rows based on their position. For example, rows 3 and 7 are mirrored, rows 4 and 8 are mirrored, etc.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each row i, if i is 3, then copy it to row 7. Similarly for row 4 to row 8, etc.\n\nBut how to implement that?\n\nFor example, in code:\n\nfor i in range(12):\n    if i == 2:  # row 3 (0-based is 2)\n        copy_row = 6  # row 7 (0-based is 6)\n        for j in range(10):\n            output[copy_row][j] = input[i][j]\n    elif i == 3:\n        copy_row = 7\n        for j in range(10):\n            output[copy_row][j] = input[i][j]\n    # and so on for other rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to copy?\n\nIn Example 2, the input's rows 2 (third row) and 3 (fourth row) are copied to rows 6 (seventh row) and 7 (eighth row). So for i=2, copy to 6; for i=3, copy to 7.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe for rows 2 and 3, copy them to rows 6 and 7. But that's just for Example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are mirrored in the middle of the grid. For example, row 2 is mirrored in row 9 (since 12-2-1=9), but in Example 2, the mirrored row is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take certain rows and mirror them in the grid. For example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row. So the code would be to copy row 2 to row 6.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to copy?\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of mirroring certain rows and columns, and replication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror the grid vertically. For example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row. So the code would be to mirror the grid vertically, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother idea: look for the positions where the numbers are added. In Example 1, the output has new numbers in rows 6,7,8,9,10. For example, row 6 has a 3, row 7 has 1 and 3, row 8 has 4 and 4, row 9 has 1, row 10 has 7 and 2.\n\nThese numbers seem to be derived from the input's rows. For example, row 6's 3 might be from row 5's 7. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's row 6 has a 3 in column 7. That could be because the input's row 5 has a 7 in column 4. So 7 is transformed into 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with their mirrored values. For example, 7 becomes 3, 2 becomes 1, etc. But that's arbitrary.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, maybe I should try to implement a transformation that mirrors certain rows and columns, as seen in the examples.\n\nFor example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row. So the code would copy row 2 to row 6, and row 3 to row 7.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the sixth row is all zeros, but in the output, it has a 3. Maybe that's a copy of some other row.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror the grid vertically. For example, the first row is mirrored in the last row, the second row in the second last, etc. But in Example 2, the third row is not mirrored in the ninth row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror the grid horizontally. For example, the first column is mirrored in the last column. But in Example 2, the third row has 3 in column 2, and the seventh row has 3 in column 6. So that's a mirror around the middle column.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each cell (i,j), the mirrored cell is (i, 9-j). So for j=2, the mirrored column is 9-2=7. But in Example 2, the seventh row has 3 in column 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirrored column is 9-j-1. For j=2, 9-2-1=6, which matches the seventh row's column 6.\n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if it's in a certain row, it's mirrored to (i, 9-j-1).\n\nBut how does this apply to the examples?\n\nIn Example 2, the third row (i=2) has 3 in column 2. The mirrored column is 9-2-1=6. So the mirrored cell is (2,6). But in the output, the seventh row (i=6) has 3 in column 6. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Given the time, I'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to mirror certain rows and columns. For example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row, and the fourth row is mirrored in the eighth row. So the code would copy row 2 to row 6, and row 3 to row 7.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the sixth row is all zeros, but in the output, it has a 3. Maybe that's a copy of some other row.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe the code would look like this:\n\n- For each row i in the input, if i is in [2,3], copy it to row 6 and 7 respectively.\n\nBut this is just for Example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is to mirror certain rows. For example, for rows 2 and 3, copy them to rows 6 and 7.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, the code could be to mirror the grid vertically, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother approach: look for the output in Example 1. The output has some new numbers in certain positions. For example, in row 6, column 7 is 3. In the input, row 5, column 4 is 7. Maybe the 3 is derived from 7 by subtracting 4? 7-4=3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the 3 is the same as the input's row 5, column 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in the output, the 3 in row 6, column 7 is the same as the input's row 5, column 4. So the code would copy the input's row 5, column 4 to the output's row 6, column 7.\n\nBut how to determine this pattern?\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I'll try to write a function that mirrors certain rows and columns based on the examples.\n\nFor example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row. So the code could be to mirror rows 2 and 3 to rows 6 and 7.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the sixth row is all zeros, but in the output, it has a 3. Maybe that's a copy of some other row.\n\nBut I'm not sure. So perhaps the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Mirror rows 2 and 3 to rows 6 and 7\n    for i in range(10):\n        transformed[6][i] = grid[2][i]\n        transformed[7][i] = grid[3][i]\n    # Mirror other rows if needed\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just for Example 2. However, this would not handle the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror the grid vertically, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 6, column 3. The output has the same. But in row 7, there's a 2 in column 4. The input's row 4 has a 2 in column 5. So maybe the code is to copy certain rows.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: the transformation is to mirror certain rows and columns. For example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row. So the code would copy row 2 to row 6, and row 3 to row 7.\n\nFor the other examples, I'll assume that similar mirroring is happening.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Mirror rows 2 and 3 to rows 6 and 7\n    for j in range(10):\n        transformed[6][j] = grid[2][j]\n        transformed[7][j] = grid[3][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would only handle Example 2. However, this might not be correct for other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to mirror the entire grid vertically. For example, each row i is mirrored in row 11 - i.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 2. For row 2 (third row), the mirrored row would be 11-2=9. But in the output, the mirrored row is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to mirror the grid horizontally. For example, each column j is mirrored in column 9-j.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, in Example 2, the third row has 3 in column 2. The mirrored column would be 9-2=7. So the mirrored cell would be in column 7. But in the output's seventh row, column 7 is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that mirrors certain rows as seen in Example 2, and see if it works for the test input.\n\nBut the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 3 3 8 8 0 0 0\n\nThe output for this would need to be generated by the transformation. If the transformation is to mirror certain rows, then the third row (index 2) is 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So the mirrored row would be row 6 (index 6). But in the test input, row 6 is all zeros. So the code would copy the third row to row 6, which is 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. But the test input's row 6 is all zeros, so the transformed grid would have that row as 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. But I don't know what the actual output should be.\n\nBut since the test input is not part of the training examples, I can't know. So I have to make a guess based on the training examples.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the code that mirrors certain rows as seen in the examples.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the correct transformation is to mirror certain rows and columns. For example, in Example 2, the third row is mirrored in the seventh row, and the fourth row in the eighth row. So the code would copy those rows.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Copy row 2 to row 6\n    for j in range(10):\n        transformed[6][j] = grid[2][j]\n    # Copy row 3 to row 7\n    for j in range(10):\n        transformed[7][j] = grid[3][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would handle Example 2. However, it might not handle other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has new rows. So perhaps this code is not sufficient.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code and see.\n"
