          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. Let's start with Example 1.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input is a 17x17 grid, and the output is also 17x17. The first example's input has some numbers, and the output has some changes. Let me check some positions.\n\nFor instance, in the first row of the input, the numbers are 0 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for the first row is 0 4 0 0 8 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 9 0 0. So the 6th element (index 5) in the input was 0, but in the output it's 9. Also, the 9th element (index 8) was 0, but in output it's 7. Then, the 15th element (index 14) was 0, but in output it's 9.\n\nHmm, maybe there's some kind of replacement or pattern based on positions. Let me check other rows. For example, the second row of input is 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 4 0. The output for this row is 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 9 4 0. So the 14th element (index 13) was 0, but in output it's 9. The 16th element (index 15) was 4, which remains 4. Wait, but in the output, the 15th element (index 14) is 9. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 9 or 7 based on some rule.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has some rows with 0s and 1s, and the output has numbers like 8, 4, 1, etc. For example, in the first input row of Example 2, the output is 8 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the original input was 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output changed the 5th element (index 4) to 4, and the 9th element (index 8) to 1. Then, the 13th element (index 12) was 6 in the input, but in output it's 0. Wait, no, the input for Example 2's first row is 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 8 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the fifth element (index 4) became 4, and the ninth (index 8) became 1. Then, the 13th element (index 12) was 0 in input and 0 in output. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with specific numbers based on their positions.\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input is all zeros except for some positions. The output has 3s in certain positions. For example, the first input row is all zeros, but the output's first row is 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. So the third element (index 2) is 3, and the ninth (index 8) is 7. Then, in the next rows, similar patterns. For example, the third input row is all zeros, but the output is 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. So maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, numbers are placed based on their row and column.\n\nLooking at Example 4. The input is a 7x7 grid (but the problem says 17x17, but maybe the examples are smaller). The input has some 6s and 5s. The output replaces some 0s with 6s and 5s. For example, the fourth row of input is 0 0 0 6 0 0 0, and the output is the same. But the seventh row of input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0, and the output is same. But in the first three rows, the input is all zeros, and the output is 6s in the fourth column. So maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the value is set based on the row or column.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain positions with specific values based on their coordinates. For example, in Example 3, the third column (index 2) is set to 3 in some rows, and the ninth column (index 8) is set to 7. But in Example 4, the fourth column (index 3) is set to 6 in some rows, and fifth column (index 4) is set to 5 in others. So maybe the pattern is that for certain positions (like (row, column) where row is even or odd, or column is even or odd), certain values are placed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, in Example 3, the output seems to have 3s in the third column and 7s in the ninth column for certain rows. But in Example 4, the fourth column is filled with 6s in some rows, and fifth column with 5s in others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. For example, in Example 3, the third column is set to 3 in all rows, and the ninth column is set to 7. But in Example 4, the fourth column is set to 6 in some rows, and fifth column to 5 in others.\n\nBut how to generalize this for 17x17 grid? Let's think again.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has rows where in the third column (index 2) there's a 3 in the second input row (row 1?), but the output has 3 in that position. Wait, the input for Example 3 is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n\nSo the pattern here is that for certain rows and columns, specific values are placed. For example, in rows 1 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), the third column (index 2) is 3, and the ninth column (index 8) is 7. Then, in row 3 (assuming 0-based?), the third column is 3 again, but the ninth is 7. Then, in row 4 (input row 4?), the third column is 3 again, and ninth is 7. Then, in row 5 (input row 5?), the third column is 3? Wait, no. Wait, in the input for row 5, the third column is 0, but in the output, it's 4. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices.\n\nWait, in the input for row 4 (assuming 0-based index 4?), the third column (index 2) is 3. But in the output, the third column is 3 again. But for row 5 (input row 5?), the third column is 0, but the output is 4. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the pattern is different. Let me check the input and output for Example 3.\n\nLooking at the output for row 5 (input row 5?), the output is 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. Wait, the input for row 5 (assuming 0-based index 4) is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. So the third column (index 2) was 0 in input, but in output it's 4. So that's different. So maybe the pattern is not based on the input value but on the position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell, if the row is even or odd, or column is even or odd, then certain values are placed. For example, in Example 3, the third column (index 2) is set to 3 for rows 1, 2, 3, 4 (assuming 0-based?), but in row 5, it's 4. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2, or something like that. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at Example 4 again. The input is 7x7 grid, but the output is 7x7. The input has some 6s and 5s. The output seems to replace some 0s with 6s and 5s. For example, in the fourth row of input, the fourth column is 6, and in the output, it's the same. But for the seventh row, the fourth column is 5, and the output is same. But for the first three rows, the fourth column is 6. So maybe the pattern is that for certain positions, the value is set to 6 if the row is less than 4, and 5 otherwise. But how does this apply to the 17x17 grid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if i is in a certain range, or j is in a certain range, then the value is set to a certain number. For example, in Example 3, the third column (j=2) is set to 3 for certain rows, and the ninth column (j=8) is set to 7 for others. But in Example 4, the fourth column (j=3) is set to 6 for rows 0-3, and 5 for rows 4-6.\n\nBut how to generalize this for 17x17 grid? Maybe the pattern is that certain positions are filled with specific values based on their row and column indices. For example, in Example 3, for rows 0-3, column 2 is 3, and column 8 is 7. For rows 4-6, column 2 is 4, column 8 is 7. Then, for rows 7-8, column 2 is 4, column 8 is 8. For rows 9-11, column 2 is 5, column 8 is 5. So maybe the pattern is that for each row, certain columns are filled with specific values based on the row number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2, and if j is even, set to 7 in column 8. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced with specific values based on their position. For example, in Example 3, the third column (index 2) is set to 3 in rows 0-3, then 4 in rows 4-6, then 5 in rows 7-11. Similarly, column 8 is set to 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5.\n\nBut how to find a general rule for this. Maybe the pattern is that for each row, certain columns are filled with values based on the row's index. For example, in Example 3, the third column (index 2) is filled with 3 for rows 0-3, then 4 for rows 4-6, then 5 for rows 7-11. Similarly for column 8.\n\nBut how to find this in code. For example, for each row i, if i is in a certain range, set column 2 to a certain value. But this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the third column (index 2) for all rows is 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5. So maybe for each row, the value in column 2 is 3 if row < 4, 4 if row < 8, 5 otherwise. Similarly for column 8, the value is 7 for rows 0-5, then 7 for 6-7, then 8 for 8-9, then 5 for 10-11.\n\nThis seems too arbitrary, but perhaps that's the pattern. But how to generalize this for the 17x17 grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the third column is filled with 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5. So for rows 0-3 (4 rows), it's 3. Then rows 4-7 (4 rows), it's 4. Then rows 8-11 (4 rows), it's 5. So maybe for column 2, the value is 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for 4-7, 5 for 8-11. Similarly for column 8, it's 7 for rows 0-5, then 7 for 6-7, then 8 for 8-9, then 5 for 10-11.\n\nBut how to find this in code. It's possible that for certain columns, the values are set based on the row's index. For example, for column 2, the value is 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for rows 4-7, 5 for rows 8-11.\n\nBut how to determine this for the 17x17 grid. Maybe the pattern is that for each column, the value is determined by some function of the row index. But this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 4, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 6 for rows 0-3, and 5 for rows 4-6. So maybe for column 3, the value is 6 for rows 0-3, 5 for 4-6. Similarly for other columns.\n\nBut how to generalize this. It's possible that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row index. For example, in Example 3, column 2 is filled with 3 for the first four rows, 4 for the next four, and 5 for the next four. So for column 2, the value is 3 if row <4, 4 if row <8, 5 if row >=8.\n\nBut how to find this for the 17x17 grid. Maybe the pattern is that for certain columns, the value is set to a certain number based on the row's index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2, or something like that. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain cells, the value is determined by the row and column. For example, in Example 3, the third column (index 2) is set to 3 in the first four rows, then 4 in the next four, then 5 in the next four. Similarly, column 8 is set to 7 in the first six rows, then 8 in the next two, then 5 in the next two. So for column 2, the value depends on the row's index. For example:\n\nFor column 2:\n- if row is in 0-3: 3\n- if row is in 4-7: 4\n- if row is in 8-11: 5\n\nFor column 8:\n- if row is in 0-5: 7\n- if row is in 6-7: 7\n- if row is in 8-9: 8\n- if row is in 10-11: 5\n\nBut how to find this in code. It seems like the pattern is that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row's index. But how to determine which columns and which values to use.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), the value is determined by some function of i and j. For example, in Example 3, the third column (j=2) is set to 3 for rows 0-3, then 4 for rows 4-7, then 5 for rows 8-11. So for j=2, the value is 3 + (i//4). But that's just a guess.\n\nBut how to find this for the test input. The test input is a 17x17 grid. So for each cell (i,j), maybe the value is determined by some function of i and j. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again. The output has some 9s and 7s. For example, in the first row, the 6th element (index 5) is 9. The 9th element (index 8) is 7. The 15th element (index 14) is 9. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are set to 9 or 7 based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if j is even, then set to 9 or 7 based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain positions (like (i,j) where i is even and j is even), the value is set to a certain number. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), the value is set to 9 if i is even and j is even, or something like that. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the third column (j=2) is filled with values that increase as the row increases. So maybe the value for column j is determined by the row's index. For example, for column 2, the value is 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for rows 4-7, 5 for rows 8-11. Similarly for column 8, the value is 7 for rows 0-5, 7 for 6-7, 8 for 8-9, 5 for 10-11.\n\nThis suggests that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row's index. So, perhaps the transformation is that for each column, the value is set to a certain value based on the row's index. For example, for column 2, the value is 3 for rows 0-3, then 4 for rows 4-7, then 5 for rows 8-11. This would mean that for each row, the value in column 2 is 3 + (row // 4). But how to determine which columns and which values.\n\nBut how to apply this to the test input. The test input is a 17x17 grid. So for each cell (i,j), if j is 2, then the value is 3 + (i // 4). Similarly for other columns. But this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain columns, the value is set to 3, 4, 5, etc., based on the row's index. For example, in Example 3, column 2 has 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for 4-7, 5 for 8-11. So for column 2, the value is 3 + (i // 4). Similarly for column 8, it's 7 for rows 0-5, then 7 for 6-7, then 8 for 8-9, then 5 for 10-11. So for column 8, the value is 7 for rows 0-5, 7 for 6-7, then 8 for 8-9, and 5 for 10-11. This seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize this. It's possible that the transformation is that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row's index. However, without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), the value is set to 3 if j is 2 and i is even, 4 if j is 2 and i is odd, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 4, the output for rows 0-3 has 6 in column 3, and rows 4-6 have 5 in column 3. So for column 3, the value is 6 if row <4, 5 otherwise. So for column 3, the value is 6 for rows 0-3, and 5 for rows 4-6.\n\nThis suggests that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row's index. So, for example, for column 3, the value is 6 for rows 0-3, and 5 for rows 4-6. So for each column, the value depends on the row's index.\n\nIf this is the case, then perhaps the transformation is that for each column j, the value in row i is determined by some function of i. For example, in Example 3, column 2 has values that increase as the row increases. So for column 2, the value is 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for 4-7, 5 for 8-11. So for each row i, the value for column 2 is 3 + (i // 4). Similarly, for column 8, the value is 7 for rows 0-5, 7 for 6-7, 8 for 8-9, 5 for 10-11. This seems like a pattern where the value for column j is determined by some rule based on the row's index.\n\nBut how to determine which columns are being modified and what the rules are. This seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2, and if i is odd, set to 4 in column 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain positions, the value is set to 9 or 7 based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output has 9 in certain positions. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: look for the most common transformation across all examples. For example, in Example 3, the output has certain columns filled with specific values. In Example 4, certain columns are filled with specific values. Perhaps the pattern is that for certain columns, the value is set to a fixed number based on the row's index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is even, then set to 3, and if j is odd, set to 7. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2, and if i is odd, set to 4 in column 2. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for certain positions, the value is set to 9 or 7 based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output has 9 in certain positions. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, it's challenging to find a consistent pattern across all examples. However, looking at Example 3, the output seems to have certain columns filled with specific values based on the row's index. For example, column 2 is filled with values that increase as the row increases, and column 8 is filled with values that change in a specific way.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row's index. For example, in Example 3, column 2 is filled with 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for rows 4-7, 5 for rows 8-11. Similarly, column 8 is filled with 7 for rows 0-5, 7 for rows 6-7, 8 for rows 8-9, 5 for rows 10-11.\n\nSo, for each column j, there is a function that determines the value based on the row i. But how to determine which columns and which functions to apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2, then the value is 3 + (i // 4). For j=8, the value is 7 for i < 6, 8 for i=8-9, and 5 for i >=10. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this in code for the 17x17 grid. For example, for each cell (i,j), if j is 2, then set to 3 + (i // 4). Similarly for j=8.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis based on the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), the value is determined by the row and column indices. For example, in Example 3, the value is 3 for column 2 and row 0-3, and 4 for row 4-7, etc.\n\nBut how to generalize this for the test input. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to look for patterns where certain columns are filled with specific values based on the row's index.\n\nFor example, in Example 3, the third column (j=2) is filled with values that increase as the row increases. So for j=2, the value is 3 + (i // 4). Similarly, for j=8, the value is 7 for i < 6, 8 for i=8-9, and 5 for i >=10.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to apply this to. For example, in Example 3, columns 2 and 8 are being modified. In Example 4, column 3 and 4 are being modified.\n\nThis suggests that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row's index. But without more examples, it's hard to know which columns and which functions to apply.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is that for each column j, the value is set to a certain value based on the row's index. For example, for j=2, the value is 3 + (i // 4). For j=8, the value is 7 for i < 6, 8 for i=8-9, and 5 for i >=10.\n\nBut how to implement this in code. It's possible that for each column j, there's a certain pattern based on the row index i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is even, then set to 3, and if j is odd, set to 7. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2, and 7 in column 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement a transformation that for certain columns, the value is set based on the row's index. For example, for column 2, set to 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for rows 4-7, 5 for rows 8-11. Similarly for column 8.\n\nBut how to handle this for the 17x17 grid. For example, for column 2, the value would be 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for 4-7, 5 for 8-11, 6 for 12-15, 7 for 16-16 (since 17 rows). But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to apply this to. For example, in Example 3, columns 2 and 8 are modified. In Example 4, columns 3 and 4 are modified.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is that for certain columns, the value is set based on the row's index. But without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), the value is set to 9 if i is even and j is even, or something like that.\n\nBut given the time, I need to make an educated guess and write code that implements the pattern observed in the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the output has certain columns filled with specific values. For example, column 2 is filled with 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5. This suggests that for column 2, the value is 3 for the first 4 rows, 4 for the next 4 rows, and 5 for the next 4 rows. So for each row i, the value for column 2 is 3 + (i // 4). Similarly, for column 8, the value is 7 for the first 6 rows, 7 for the next 2 rows, 8 for the next 2 rows, and 5 for the next 2 rows.\n\nSo, for column 2, the value is 3 + (i // 4). For column 8, the value is 7 for i < 6, 7 for i=6-7, 8 for i=8-9, 5 for i=10-11.\n\nBut how to generalize this. For the 17x17 grid, the code would need to check for each cell (i,j) if it's in one of the special columns (like 2, 8, etc.) and apply the corresponding value based on the row.\n\nBut how to know which columns are special. This is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 8, then the value is determined by the row's index. For example, for j=2, the value is 3 + (i // 4), and for j=8, it's 7 for i < 6, 7 for i=6-7, 8 for i=8-9, 5 for i=10-11.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, the code could be written to handle these special columns. For example, for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 8, then set the value based on the row's index. For other columns, leave as is.\n\nBut how to handle the other examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 9 in certain positions. This suggests that other columns may also be modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each column j, the value is set to 3 if j is 2, 7 if j is 8, and 9 if j is 5, etc.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for certain columns (like 2 and 8), the value is set based on the row's index. For example, in Example 3, column 2 has values that increase as the row increases, and column 8 has values that change in a certain way.\n\nSo, the code could be written as follows:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\n- If j == 2, then the value is 3 + (i // 4)\n- If j == 8, then the value is 7 if i < 6, 7 if i=6-7, 8 if i=8-9, 5 if i >=10\n- Else, leave as is.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples. However, this may not cover all cases, but it's the best I can do.\n\nBut wait, in Example 4, the fourth column (j=3) is filled with 6 for rows 0-3, and 5 for rows 4-6. So for j=3, the value is 6 for i <4, 5 otherwise.\n\nSo, this suggests that for other columns, the value is also determined by the row's index. But how to determine which columns and what values.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Perhaps the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2, and if i is odd, set to 4 in column 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if j is even, then set to 3, and if j is odd, set to 7. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row's index. For example, for column 2, the value is 3 + (i // 4), and for column 8, the value is 7 for i < 6, 8 for i=8-9, 5 for i >=10.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(17)] for _ in range(17)]\n    for i in range(17):\n        for j in range(17):\n            if j == 2:\n                # For column 2, value is 3 + (i // 4)\n                transformed[i][j] = 3 + (i // 4)\n            elif j == 8:\n                # For column 8, value is 7 for i <6, 7 for i=6-7, 8 for i=8-9, 5 for i >=10\n                if i < 6:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 7\n                elif 6 <= i <= 7:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 7\n                elif 8 <= i <= 9:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 5\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples. However, this may not work for all cases. For example, in Example 1, the output has 9 in certain positions, which this code would not handle.\n\nBut given the examples provided, this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. Let's start with Example 1.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input is a 17x17 grid, and the output is also 17x17. The first example's input has some numbers, and the output has some changes. Let me check some positions.\n\nFor instance, in the first row of the input, the numbers are 0 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for the first row is 0 4 0 0 8 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 9 0 0. So the 6th element (index 5) in the input was 0, but in the output it's 9. Also, the 9th element (index 8) was 0, but in output it's 7. Then, the 15th element (index 14) was 0, but in output it's 9.\n\nHmm, maybe there's some kind of replacement or pattern based on positions. Let me check other rows. For example, the second row of input is 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 4 0. The output for this row is 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 9 4 0. So the 14th element (index 13) was 0, but in output it's 9. The 16th element (index 15) was 4, which remains 4. Wait, but in the output, the 15th element (index 14) is 9. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 9 or 7 based on some rule.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has some rows with 0s and 1s, and the output has numbers like 8, 4, 1, etc. For example, in the first input row of Example 2, the output is 8 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the original input was 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output changed the 5th element (index 4) to 4, and the 9th element (index 8) to 1. Then, the 13th element (index 12) was 6 in the input, but in output it's 0. Wait, no, the input for Example 2's first row is 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 8 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the fifth element (index 4) became 4, and the ninth (index 8) became 1. Then, the 13th element (index 12) was 0 in input and 0 in output. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with specific numbers based on their positions.\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input is all zeros except for some positions. The output has 3s in certain positions. For example, the first input row is all zeros, but the output's first row is 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. So the third element (index 2) is 3, and the ninth (index 8) is 7. Then, in the next rows, similar patterns. For example, the third input row is all zeros, but the output is 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. So maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, numbers are placed based on their row and column.\n\nLooking at Example 4. The input is a 7x7 grid (but the problem says 17x17, but maybe the examples are smaller). The input has some 6s and 5s. The output replaces some 0s with 6s and 5s. For example, the fourth row of input is 0 0 0 6 0 0 0, and the output is the same. But the seventh row of input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0, and the output is same. But in the first three rows, the input is all zeros, and the output is 6s in the fourth column. So maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the value is set based on the row or column.\n\nPutting this together, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain positions with specific values based on their coordinates. For example, in Example 3, the third column (index 2) is set to 3 in some rows, and the ninth column (index 8) is set to 7. But in Example 4, the fourth column (index 3) is set to 6 in some rows, and fifth column (index 4) is set to 5 in others. So maybe the pattern is that for certain positions (like (row, column) where row is even or odd, or column is even or odd), certain values are placed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, in Example 3, the output seems to have 3s in the third column and 7s in the ninth column for certain rows. But in Example 4, the fourth column is filled with 6s in some rows, and fifth column with 5s in others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. For example, in Example 3, the third column is set to 3 in all rows, and the ninth column is set to 7. But in Example 4, the fourth column is set to 6 in some rows, and fifth column to 5 in others.\n\nBut how to generalize this for 17x17 grid? Let's think again.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has rows where in the third column (index 2) there's a 3 in the second input row (row 1?), but the output has 3 in that position. Wait, the input for Example 3 is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n\nSo the pattern here is that for certain rows and columns, specific values are placed. For example, in rows 1 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), the third column (index 2) is 3, and the ninth column (index 8) is 7. Then, in row 3 (assuming 0-based?), the third column is 3 again, but the ninth is 7. Then, in row 4 (input row 4?), the third column is 3 again, and ninth is 7. Then, in row 5 (input row 5?), the third column is 3? Wait, no. Wait, in the input for row 5, the third column is 0, but in the output, it's 4. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices.\n\nWait, in the input for row 4 (assuming 0-based index 4?), the third column (index 2) is 3. But in the output, the third column is 3 again. But for row 5 (input row 5?), the third column is 0, but the output is 4. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the pattern is different. Let me check the input and output for Example 3.\n\nLooking at the output for row 5 (input row 5?), the output is 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. Wait, the input for row 5 (assuming 0-based index 4) is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. So the third column (index 2) was 0 in input, but in output it's 4. So that's different. So maybe the pattern is not based on the input value but on the position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell, if the row is even or odd, or column is even or odd, then certain values are placed. For example, in Example 3, the third column (index 2) is set to 3 for rows 1, 2, 3, 4 (assuming 0-based?), but in row 5, it's 4. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2, or something like that. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at Example 4 again. The input is 7x7 grid, but the output is 7x7. The input has some 6s and 5s. The output seems to replace some 0s with 6s and 5s. For example, in the fourth row of input, the fourth column is 6, and in the output, it's the same. But for the seventh row, the fourth column is 5, and the output is same. But for the first three rows, the fourth column is 6. So maybe the pattern is that for certain positions, the value is set to 6 if the row is less than 4, and 5 otherwise. But how does this apply to the 17x17 grid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if i is in a certain range, or j is in a certain range, then the value is set to a certain number. For example, in Example 3, the third column (j=2) is set to 3 for certain rows, and the ninth column (j=8) is set to 7 for others. But in Example 4, the fourth column (j=3) is set to 6 for rows 0-3, and 5 for rows 4-6.\n\nBut how to generalize this for 17x17 grid? Maybe the pattern is that certain positions are filled with specific values based on their row and column indices. For example, in Example 3, for rows 0-3, column 2 is 3, and column 8 is 7. For rows 4-6, column 2 is 4, column 8 is 7. Then, for rows 7-8, column 2 is 4, column 8 is 8. For rows 9-11, column 2 is 5, column 8 is 5. So maybe the pattern is that for each row, certain columns are filled with specific values based on the row number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2, and if j is even, set to 7 in column 8. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced with specific values based on their position. For example, in Example 3, the third column (index 2) is set to 3 in rows 0-3, then 4 in rows 4-6, then 5 in rows 7-11. Similarly, column 8 is set to 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5.\n\nBut how to find a general rule for this. Maybe the pattern is that for each row, certain columns are filled with values based on the row's index. For example, in Example 3, the third column (index 2) is filled with 3 for rows 0-3, then 4 for rows 4-6, then 5 for rows 7-11. Similarly for column 8.\n\nBut how to find this in code. For example, for each row i, if i is in a certain range, set column 2 to a certain value. But this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the third column (index 2) for all rows is 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5. So maybe for each row, the value in column 2 is 3 if row < 4, 4 if row < 8, 5 otherwise. Similarly for column 8, the value is 7 for rows 0-5, then 7 for 6-7, then 8 for 8-9, then 5 for 10-11.\n\nThis seems too arbitrary, but perhaps that's the pattern. But how to generalize this for the 17x17 grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the third column is filled with 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5. So for rows 0-3 (4 rows), it's 3. Then rows 4-7 (4 rows), it's 4. Then rows 8-11 (4 rows), it's 5. So maybe for column 2, the value is 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for 4-7, 5 for 8-11. Similarly for column 8, it's 7 for rows 0-5, then 7 for 6-7, then 8 for 8-9, then 5 for 10-11.\n\nBut how to find this in code. It's possible that for certain columns, the values are set based on the row's index. For example, for column 2, the value is 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for rows 4-7, 5 for rows 8-11.\n\nBut how to determine this for the 17x17 grid. Maybe the pattern is that for each column, the value is determined by some function of the row index. But this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 4, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 6 for rows 0-3, and 5 for rows 4-6. So maybe for column 3, the value is 6 for rows 0-3, 5 for 4-6. Similarly for other columns.\n\nBut how to generalize this. It's possible that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row index. For example, in Example 3, column 2 is filled with 3 for the first four rows, 4 for the next four, and 5 for the next four. So for column 2, the value is 3 if row <4, 4 if row <8, 5 if row >=8.\n\nBut how to find this for the 17x17 grid. Maybe the pattern is that for certain columns, the value is set to a certain number based on the row's index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2, or something like that. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain cells, the value is determined by the row and column. For example, in Example 3, the third column (index 2) is set to 3 in the first four rows, then 4 in the next four, then 5 in the next four. Similarly, column 8 is set to 7 in the first six rows, then 8 in the next two, then 5 in the next two. So for column 2, the value depends on the row's index. For example:\n\nFor column 2:\n- if row is in 0-3: 3\n- if row is in 4-7: 4\n- if row is in 8-11: 5\n\nFor column 8:\n- if row is in 0-5: 7\n- if row is in 6-7: 7\n- if row is in 8-9: 8\n- if row is in 10-11: 5\n\nBut how to find this in code. It seems like the pattern is that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row's index. But how to determine which columns and which values to use.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), the value is determined by some function of i and j. For example, in Example 3, the third column (j=2) is set to 3 for rows 0-3, then 4 for rows 4-7, then 5 for rows 8-11. So for j=2, the value is 3 + (i//4). But that's just a guess.\n\nBut how to find this for the test input. The test input is a 17x17 grid. So for each cell (i,j), maybe the value is determined by some function of i and j. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again. The output has some 9s and 7s. For example, in the first row, the 6th element (index 5) is 9. The 9th element (index 8) is 7. The 15th element (index 14) is 9. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are set to 9 or 7 based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if j is even, then set to 9 or 7 based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain positions (like (i,j) where i is even and j is even), the value is set to a certain number. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), the value is set to 9 if i is even and j is even, or something like that. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the third column (j=2) is filled with values that increase as the row increases. So maybe the value for column j is determined by the row's index. For example, for column 2, the value is 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for rows 4-7, 5 for rows 8-11. Similarly for column 8, the value is 7 for rows 0-5, 7 for 6-7, 8 for 8-9, 5 for 10-11.\n\nThis suggests that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row's index. So, perhaps the transformation is that for each column, the value is set to a certain value based on the row's index. For example, for column 2, the value is 3 for rows 0-3, then 4 for rows 4-7, then 5 for rows 8-11. This would mean that for each row, the value in column 2 is 3 + (row // 4). But how to determine which columns and which values.\n\nBut how to apply this to the test input. The test input is a 17x17 grid. So for each cell (i,j), if j is 2, then the value is 3 + (i // 4). Similarly for other columns. But this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain columns, the value is set to 3, 4, 5, etc., based on the row's index. For example, in Example 3, column 2 has 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for 4-7, 5 for 8-11. So for column 2, the value is 3 + (i // 4). Similarly for column 8, it's 7 for rows 0-5, then 7 for 6-7, then 8 for 8-9, then 5 for 10-11. So for column 8, the value is 7 for rows 0-5, 7 for 6-7, then 8 for 8-9, and 5 for 10-11. This seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize this. It's possible that the transformation is that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row's index. However, without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), the value is set to 3 if j is 2 and i is even, 4 if j is 2 and i is odd, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 4, the output for rows 0-3 has 6 in column 3, and rows 4-6 have 5 in column 3. So for column 3, the value is 6 if row <4, 5 otherwise. So for column 3, the value is 6 for rows 0-3, and 5 for rows 4-6.\n\nThis suggests that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row's index. So, for example, for column 3, the value is 6 for rows 0-3, and 5 for rows 4-6. So for each column, the value depends on the row's index.\n\nIf this is the case, then perhaps the transformation is that for each column j, the value in row i is determined by some function of i. For example, in Example 3, column 2 has values that increase as the row increases. So for column 2, the value is 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for 4-7, 5 for 8-11. So for each row i, the value for column 2 is 3 + (i // 4). Similarly, for column 8, the value is 7 for rows 0-5, 7 for 6-7, 8 for 8-9, 5 for 10-11. This seems like a pattern where the value for column j is determined by some rule based on the row's index.\n\nBut how to determine which columns are being modified and what the rules are. This seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2, and if i is odd, set to 4 in column 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain positions, the value is set to 9 or 7 based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output has 9 in certain positions. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: look for the most common transformation across all examples. For example, in Example 3, the output has certain columns filled with specific values. In Example 4, certain columns are filled with specific values. Perhaps the pattern is that for certain columns, the value is set to a fixed number based on the row's index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is even, then set to 3, and if j is odd, set to 7. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2, and if i is odd, set to 4 in column 2. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for certain positions, the value is set to 9 or 7 based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output has 9 in certain positions. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, it's challenging to find a consistent pattern across all examples. However, looking at Example 3, the output seems to have certain columns filled with specific values based on the row's index. For example, column 2 is filled with values that increase as the row increases, and column 8 is filled with values that change in a specific way.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row's index. For example, in Example 3, column 2 is filled with 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for rows 4-7, 5 for rows 8-11. Similarly, column 8 is filled with 7 for rows 0-5, 7 for rows 6-7, 8 for rows 8-9, 5 for rows 10-11.\n\nSo, for each column j, there is a function that determines the value based on the row i. But how to determine which columns and which functions to apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2, then the value is 3 + (i // 4). For j=8, the value is 7 for i < 6, 8 for i=8-9, and 5 for i >=10. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this in code for the 17x17 grid. For example, for each cell (i,j), if j is 2, then set to 3 + (i // 4). Similarly for j=8.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis based on the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), the value is determined by the row and column indices. For example, in Example 3, the value is 3 for column 2 and row 0-3, and 4 for row 4-7, etc.\n\nBut how to generalize this for the test input. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to look for patterns where certain columns are filled with specific values based on the row's index.\n\nFor example, in Example 3, the third column (j=2) is filled with values that increase as the row increases. So for j=2, the value is 3 + (i // 4). Similarly, for j=8, the value is 7 for i < 6, 8 for i=8-9, and 5 for i >=10.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to apply this to. For example, in Example 3, columns 2 and 8 are being modified. In Example 4, column 3 and 4 are being modified.\n\nThis suggests that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row's index. But without more examples, it's hard to know which columns and which functions to apply.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is that for each column j, the value is set to a certain value based on the row's index. For example, for j=2, the value is 3 + (i // 4). For j=8, the value is 7 for i < 6, 8 for i=8-9, and 5 for i >=10.\n\nBut how to implement this in code. It's possible that for each column j, there's a certain pattern based on the row index i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is even, then set to 3, and if j is odd, set to 7. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2, and 7 in column 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement a transformation that for certain columns, the value is set based on the row's index. For example, for column 2, set to 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for rows 4-7, 5 for rows 8-11. Similarly for column 8.\n\nBut how to handle this for the 17x17 grid. For example, for column 2, the value would be 3 for rows 0-3, 4 for 4-7, 5 for 8-11, 6 for 12-15, 7 for 16-16 (since 17 rows). But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to apply this to. For example, in Example 3, columns 2 and 8 are modified. In Example 4, columns 3 and 4 are modified.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is that for certain columns, the value is set based on the row's index. But without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), the value is set to 9 if i is even and j is even, or something like that.\n\nBut given the time, I need to make an educated guess and write code that implements the pattern observed in the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the output has certain columns filled with specific values. For example, column 2 is filled with 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5. This suggests that for column 2, the value is 3 for the first 4 rows, 4 for the next 4 rows, and 5 for the next 4 rows. So for each row i, the value for column 2 is 3 + (i // 4). Similarly, for column 8, the value is 7 for the first 6 rows, 7 for the next 2 rows, 8 for the next 2 rows, and 5 for the next 2 rows.\n\nSo, for column 2, the value is 3 + (i // 4). For column 8, the value is 7 for i < 6, 7 for i=6-7, 8 for i=8-9, 5 for i=10-11.\n\nBut how to generalize this. For the 17x17 grid, the code would need to check for each cell (i,j) if it's in one of the special columns (like 2, 8, etc.) and apply the corresponding value based on the row.\n\nBut how to know which columns are special. This is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 8, then the value is determined by the row's index. For example, for j=2, the value is 3 + (i // 4), and for j=8, it's 7 for i < 6, 7 for i=6-7, 8 for i=8-9, 5 for i=10-11.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, the code could be written to handle these special columns. For example, for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 8, then set the value based on the row's index. For other columns, leave as is.\n\nBut how to handle the other examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 9 in certain positions. This suggests that other columns may also be modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each column j, the value is set to 3 if j is 2, 7 if j is 8, and 9 if j is 5, etc.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for certain columns (like 2 and 8), the value is set based on the row's index. For example, in Example 3, column 2 has values that increase as the row increases, and column 8 has values that change in a certain way.\n\nSo, the code could be written as follows:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\n- If j == 2, then the value is 3 + (i // 4)\n- If j == 8, then the value is 7 if i < 6, 7 if i=6-7, 8 if i=8-9, 5 if i >=10\n- Else, leave as is.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples. However, this may not cover all cases, but it's the best I can do.\n\nBut wait, in Example 4, the fourth column (j=3) is filled with 6 for rows 0-3, and 5 for rows 4-6. So for j=3, the value is 6 for i <4, 5 otherwise.\n\nSo, this suggests that for other columns, the value is also determined by the row's index. But how to determine which columns and what values.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Perhaps the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 3 in column 2, and if i is odd, set to 4 in column 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each cell (i,j), if j is even, then set to 3, and if j is odd, set to 7. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for certain columns, the value is determined by the row's index. For example, for column 2, the value is 3 + (i // 4), and for column 8, the value is 7 for i < 6, 8 for i=8-9, 5 for i >=10.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(17)] for _ in range(17)]\n    for i in range(17):\n        for j in range(17):\n            if j == 2:\n                # For column 2, value is 3 + (i // 4)\n                transformed[i][j] = 3 + (i // 4)\n            elif j == 8:\n                # For column 8, value is 7 for i <6, 7 for i=6-7, 8 for i=8-9, 5 for i >=10\n                if i < 6:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 7\n                elif 6 <= i <= 7:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 7\n                elif 8 <= i <= 9:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 5\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples. However, this may not work for all cases. For example, in Example 1, the output has 9 in certain positions, which this code would not handle.\n\nBut given the examples provided, this is the best I can do.\n"
