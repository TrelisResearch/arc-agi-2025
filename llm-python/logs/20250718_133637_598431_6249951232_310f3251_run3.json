          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is two rows:\n0 0\n0 7\n\nAnd the output is a 6x6 grid. Looking at the output, it seems like there's some repetition. The first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0, then the second row is 0 7 0 7 0 7. Then the third row is same as first, fourth same as second, and so on. So maybe the input is being used to generate a pattern that repeats every two rows. But how does the input relate to the output?\n\nWait, the input has two rows. The output has 6 rows. Maybe the input is being expanded in some way. Let's think about the output rows. The first two rows are alternating between 2 and 0, and 0 and 7. Then the same pattern repeats. So maybe the input is being used as a pattern that's repeated multiple times. But how?\n\nAnother thing: the input has two rows. The output has 6 rows. So maybe the input is being used to generate a pattern that's repeated three times. For example, the first two rows of the output are the same as the input's two rows, but modified. Wait, the input's first row is 0 0, and the output's first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So maybe each cell in the input is being expanded into a pattern. For example, the input's cell (0,0) is 0, which becomes 2 0 2 0 2 0 in the first row. But that's not exactly matching. Wait, maybe the input is a pattern that's being used to generate a larger grid by expanding each cell into a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a pattern that's used to create a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value. For example, in Example 1, the input has two rows. The output is 6 rows. So maybe the input is being used as a base pattern that's repeated multiple times. Let me think about the output for Example 1. The first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. The second is 0 7 0 7 0 7. Then the third row is same as first, fourth same as second, etc. So the output is alternating between two rows, each repeated three times. So the input's two rows are being expanded into three copies each. But how does the input's values translate into the output's values?\n\nIn the input, the first row is 0 0. The output's first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So maybe the input's value 0 is being replaced by 2 in some way. But how? Maybe the input is a pattern that's being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if the input has a cell with value 0, then in the output, it's replaced by 2 in even positions and 0 in odd? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2. The input is three rows:\n\n0 0 0\n0 0 6\n6 0 0\n\nThe output is a 9x9 grid. Looking at the output, it seems that the input's rows are being expanded into three copies each. For example, the first row of the input is 0 0 0. The output's first three rows are:\n\n0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\n0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6\n6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n\nSo the first row of the input is 0 0 0. The output's first row is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So maybe each cell in the input is being expanded into a pattern. For example, the input's cell (0,0) is 0, which becomes 0 in the output's first row, but then there's a 2 in the next positions. Hmm, maybe the input is a pattern that's being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on their position. For example, if the input has a value of 0, then in the output, it's replaced by 2 in even columns and 0 in odd? Or maybe the input is being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by 2 if it's 0, and 7 if it's 7. But that's not matching the first example.\n\nWait, in example 1, the input has 0 and 7. The output has 2 and 7. So maybe the input's value is being transformed in some way. For example, 0 becomes 2, and 7 remains 7. But why would that be? Also, in example 2, the input has 0, 0, 6. The output has 0, 2, 0, etc. So maybe 0 becomes 2, and 6 remains 6. But in example 3, the input has 0 and 8. The output has 2 and 8. So that seems to fit. So maybe the transformation is that any cell with value 0 is replaced by 2, and other values are left as is. But then how does that explain the output structure?\n\nBut looking at example 1's output, the first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So the first row of the input is 0 0. So each cell in the input is being expanded into a pattern. For example, each 0 in the input is replaced by a 2 in the output's first row, but the output's first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. Wait, that's not matching. Because the input's first row is two cells, but the output's first row is six cells. So maybe the input is being used as a pattern that's being expanded into a larger grid. For example, each cell in the input is expanded into three cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a pattern that's being used to generate a grid where each cell is repeated multiple times. For example, in example 1, the input has two rows. The output has six rows. So maybe the input is being used as a base pattern that's repeated three times. But the output's rows are alternating between two patterns. So maybe the input is being used to generate a grid where each row is repeated multiple times. For example, the first two rows of the output are the same as the input's two rows, but with some modification. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a pattern that's being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if the input has a cell with value 0, then in the output, it's replaced by 2 in even positions and 0 in odd. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 2's input:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 6\nRow 2: 6 0 0\n\nThe output is a 9x9 grid. The first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow 1: 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6\nRow 2: 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n\nSo each row of the input is being expanded into three rows. For example, the first input row (0 0 0) becomes three rows. The first row of the output is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So each cell in the input is being expanded into three cells. For example, the first cell (0,0) is 0, which becomes 0 in the first position of the output row, then 2 in the second, then 0 in the third? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the input is being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain pattern. For example, if the input cell is 0, then in the output, it's replaced by 0 followed by 2 and 0, but that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 3x3 grid. But that's not matching the size. For example, example 1's input is 2x2, and the output is 6x6. So 2x2 becomes 6x6. That's a 3x3 expansion. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1. The output is 6 rows. Each row is 6 elements. The input is 2 rows. So maybe the output is generated by repeating the input's rows in some pattern. For example, the output is the input's rows repeated three times, but with some modifications. But the first row of the output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. The input's first row is 0 0. So maybe each cell in the input is being expanded into three cells. For example, the first row of the input is 0 0. So each cell is expanded into 2 0 2 0 2 0. Wait, that's 6 elements. So maybe each cell in the input is replaced by a pattern of 2 0 2 0 2 0, but that's not matching. Wait, the input has two cells, and the output has six cells in the first row. So maybe each input cell is expanded into three cells. For example, 0 becomes 2 0 2. Then the first row of the input is 0 0, so the first row of the output is 2 0 2 2 0 2. But the actual output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is repeated in a certain way. For example, the input is a pattern that's being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, in example 1, the input has two rows. The output is 6 rows. So maybe the input is being used as a base pattern that's repeated three times. For example, the first two rows of the output are the same as the input's rows, but modified. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's output: the first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. The second row is 0 7 0 7 0 7. The third row is same as first. Fourth same as second. So the output is a pattern that alternates between two rows, each repeated three times. So the input's two rows are being expanded into three copies each. But how does that relate to the input's values?\n\nIn the input, the first row is 0 0. The output's first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So maybe each cell in the input is being replaced by a pattern that alternates between 2 and 0. For example, if the input cell is 0, then in the output, it's replaced by 2 in even positions and 0 in odd. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is expanded into a 3x3 grid. But that would make the output size larger. However, the input's size is 2x2, and the output is 6x6. So 2x2 becomes 6x6. That's not a 3x3 expansion. Wait, 2*3=6. So maybe each cell in the input is expanded into three cells in each direction. So the input's rows are being repeated three times, and each cell is expanded into three cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if the cell is in an even row or column, it's 2, else 0. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's input:\n\nInput is 5 rows. The output is 15 rows. So maybe the input's rows are being repeated three times. But the output is 15 rows, which is 5*3. So that's possible. For example, the input has 5 rows, and the output has 5*3=15 rows. But how does that work with the example?\n\nIn example 3's input, the first row is 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n\nSo the first row of the input is 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first three rows are different. So maybe the input is being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a pattern. For example, if the input cell is 0, then in the output, it's replaced by 2 in certain positions and 0 in others. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is expanded into a 3x3 pattern. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has rows that alternate between two patterns. The first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. The second row is 0 7 0 7 0 7. Then the same pattern repeats. So the output is generated by repeating the input's rows, but with some transformation. For example, the input's first row is 0 0, which becomes the first two rows of the output, but with 2 and 0. Wait, no. The first row of the output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. The input's first row is 0 0. So maybe each cell in the input is expanded into three cells. For example, 0 becomes 2 0 2, but then the first row is 0 0, so the first row of the output is 2 0 2 2 0 2. But that's not matching the actual output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is being used as a pattern that's being repeated in a certain way. For example, the input's rows are being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if the input cell is 0, then in the output, the cell is 2 if it's in an even row or column. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 2. The input has three rows. The output has nine rows. Each input row is expanded into three rows. For example, the first input row is 0 0 0, which becomes three rows. The first row of the output is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. The second row is 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. The third row is 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0. So each input row is being expanded into three rows. But how?\n\nLooking at the first input row (0 0 0), the output's first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow 1: 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6\nRow 2: 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n\nSo the first input row is 0 0 0. The output's first three rows are generated by taking the input's row and expanding it into three rows. For example, the first row of the output is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So the input's cell (0,0) is 0, which becomes 0 in the first position of the output row. Then, the next cell is 0, which becomes 2 in the second position. Then 0 becomes 0 in third, then 2 in fourth, etc. This seems like a pattern where the input's cell is replaced by a pattern of 0 2 0 2 0 2... but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if the cell is 0, then in the output, it's replaced by 2 if it's in an even column, and 0 otherwise. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2's output, the first row of the output is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. This seems like the input's row is being expanded into three copies, but with some alternating values. For example, the input's row is 0 0 0. The output's first row is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So maybe each cell in the input is expanded into three cells. For example, 0 becomes 0, 2, 0. But that's not matching the first row. Alternatively, maybe the input's row is being expanded into a pattern where each cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern. For example, 0 becomes 0 2 0, and then repeated. But the input has three cells, so the output row would be 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. That matches the first row of the output. So that seems to fit.\n\nSo for example, each cell in the input is replaced by a 3-cell pattern. For example:\n\nIf the input cell is 0, then it's replaced by 0 2 0.\n\nIf the input cell is 6, then it's replaced by 6 0 0.\n\nWait, but in example 2's output, the second row is 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. So the input's second row is 0 0 6. So each cell is replaced by 0 0 6? But that would make the output row 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. Which matches the second row of the output. Similarly, the third row of the input is 6 0 0. So each cell is replaced by 6 0 0, leading to the third row of the output as 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0. Which matches the third row of the output.\n\nSo this seems to be a possible pattern. So the transformation is that each cell in the input is replaced by a 3-cell pattern. For example:\n\nIf the input cell is 0, then it's replaced by 0 2 0.\n\nIf the input cell is 6, then it's replaced by 6 0 0.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the input's first row is 0 0. The output's first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So according to this pattern, each 0 would be replaced by 0 2 0. So the first row would be 0 2 0 0 2 0. But the actual output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So that doesn't match. Hmm. So this approach works for example 2, but not example 1. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the input is being expanded into three rows and three columns. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is expanded into a 3x3 grid. But that would make the output size larger. For example, if the input is 2x2, the output is 6x6. Which is 3 times larger in each dimension. So perhaps the input is being expanded by a factor of 3 in both directions.\n\nBut how? For example, in example 1, the input is 2x2. The output is 6x6. So each input cell is expanded into a 3x3 grid. But that would mean that each cell in the input becomes a 3x3 block. But that's not matching the output. For example, the first row of the output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. If each input cell is expanded into a 3x3 block, then the first row would have 2x3=6 cells. So the first input row is 0 0. So each cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern. But the first row of the output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So that would mean that each 0 is replaced by 2 0 2. But then the first row would be 2 0 2 2 0 2. Which doesn't match the output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is being used as a pattern that's repeated in a certain way. For example, the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if the cell is in an even row or column, it's 2, else 0. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output: the first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. The second row is 0 7 0 7 0 7. So the first row has 2 in even positions (columns 0, 2, 4), and 0 in odd positions. The second row has 0 in even positions and 7 in odd. So perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's values and using them to determine the value in the output grid. For example, if the input cell is 0, then in the output, it's 2 if the column is even, else 0. If the input cell is 7, then in the output, it's 0 if the column is even, else 7. But how does that work for the input's rows?\n\nIn example 1, the input has two rows. The output has six rows. So maybe the input is being expanded into three copies of each row. For example, the input's first row is 0 0. The output's first three rows are generated by taking the input's first row and applying the pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the input is being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position in the output grid. For example, if the output cell is at (i,j), then the value is determined by the input's cell (i//3, j//3), but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output, the first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So the first row is alternating between 2 and 0. The second row is 0 7 0 7 0 7. So the first row is generated by the input's first row (0 0), and the second row by the input's second row (0 7). So maybe for each row in the output, it's generated by taking the input's row and applying a pattern. For example, if the input's row is [a, b], then the output's row is [a', b', a', b', a', b'] where a' is 2 if a is 0, else 0. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the input's row is being used to generate a row in the output by repeating it three times, but with some transformation. For example, the input's first row is [0, 0], and the output's first row is [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], which is like [2, 0] repeated three times. So maybe the input's row is transformed into a pattern that is repeated three times. For example, if the input's row is [0, 0], then the output row is [2, 0] repeated three times. But how does that work?\n\nIn example 1's output, the first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. Which is [2, 0] repeated three times. So the input's row is [0, 0], and the output row is [2, 0] repeated three times. But why would 0 become 2 and 0 become 0? Maybe the input's value is used to determine the value in the output's row. For example, if the input's value is 0, then the output's value is 2 if it's in an even position, 0 otherwise. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the input's value is used to determine the value in the output's row. For example, if the input's value is 0, then the output's value is 2 for even positions and 0 for odd. If the input's value is 7, then the output's value is 0 for even positions and 7 for odd. This would explain example 1's output.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. For example 1, input row 0 is [0, 0]. The output row 0 is [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]. So each cell in the input is expanded into three cells. For the first input cell (0), which is 0, the output cells are 2, 0, 2. So for even positions (0, 2, 4), it's 2, and for odd positions (1, 3, 5), it's 0. That seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, the second input row is [0, 7]. The output row is [0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7]. So for each input cell, the output cells are 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7. So for the input cell 0, which is 0, the output is 0 for even positions and 7 for odd. Wait, that's not matching. Because the input cell 0 is 0, and the output for the first cell is 0, which is even position (0), then 7 for the next cell (position 1, which is odd), then 0 for position 2 (even), etc. So this would imply that the input's value determines the value for the output's cells based on their position. For example, if the input cell is 0, then in the output, the cell's value is 2 if the position is even, else 0. If the input cell is 7, then the output's cell is 0 if even, else 7. \n\nBut how does this fit with example 2? Let's look at example 2's input. The input has rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 6\nRow 2: 6 0 0\n\nThe output is a 9x9 grid. The first three rows of the output are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow 1: 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6\nRow 2: 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n\nSo for row 0 of the input (0 0 0), the output row 0 is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So each input cell is expanded into three cells. The first input cell is 0, so the first three cells are 0, 2, 0. The second input cell is 0, so the next three cells are 0, 2, 0. The third input cell is 0, so the next three cells are 0, 2, 0. But that would make the row 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. Which matches. So this seems to fit.\n\nFor row 1 of the input, which is 0 0 6. The output row 1 is 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. So each input cell is expanded into three cells. The first input cell is 0, so the first three cells are 0, 0, 6? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, the output row is 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. So for the first input cell (0), the output cells are 0, 0, 6. But that doesn't fit the previous pattern. So maybe there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the input's value determines the value for the output's cell, and the position in the output's row determines whether it's even or odd. For example, if the input cell is 0, then in the output, the cell is 2 if the position is even, else 0. If the input cell is 6, then in the output, the cell is 6 if the position is even, else 0. But that would explain example 1 and example 2.\n\nLet's test this. For example 1's input row 0: 0 0. The output row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So each input cell is 0. For each position in the output row, if it's even, 2; else 0. So the first position (0) is even, so 2. Position 1 is odd, 0. Position 2 even, 2. Etc. So that fits.\n\nFor example 2's input row 0: 0 0 0. The output row is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So for each input cell (0), the output is 0 in even positions, 2 in odd. Wait, no. The first cell in the output row is 0. But according to the rule, if the input cell is 0, the output is 2 in even positions and 0 in odd. But the first cell is even (position 0), so it should be 2. But the output is 0. So this contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the previous idea is incorrect. So what's different here?\n\nLooking at example 2's output row 0: 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. The first cell is 0. But according to the previous hypothesis, if the input cell is 0, then it should be 2. But it's 0. So that doesn't fit. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nSo maybe the rule is different. Let's think again.\n\nIn example 1's input row 0 is 0 0. The output row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So the first cell is 2. The second is 0, third is 2, fourth 0, etc. So for each input cell, the output is 2 in even positions, 0 in odd. But the input cell is 0, so the output is 2 in even positions, 0 in odd. So the first input cell (0) is replaced by a pattern of 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0. But how does that fit with the input's row being 0 0? Maybe each input cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern. So the input row has two cells, and the output row has 6 cells. So each input cell is replaced by 3 cells. For example, the first input cell (0) is replaced by 2 0 2, and the second input cell (0) is replaced by 2 0 2. So the output row would be 2 0 2 2 0 2. But the actual output row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's row is being used to generate the output row by repeating it three times, but with some transformation. For example, the input row is [0, 0], and the output row is [2, 0] repeated three times. So the output row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. That fits. So for each input row, the output row is generated by taking the input row and replacing each cell with a pattern that is repeated three times. For example, if the input cell is 0, then it is replaced by 2 0. If the input cell is 7, it is replaced by 0 7. But how does this work with the input's row?\n\nIn example 1's input row 0 is [0, 0]. So the output row is [2 0] repeated three times: 2 0 2 0 2 0. Which matches.\n\nIn example 2's input row 0 is [0, 0, 0]. The output row 0 is [0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0]. So each input cell is replaced by [0 2 0]. But wait, the input row is three cells, and the output row is nine cells. So each input cell is replaced by three cells. So the input cell 0 is replaced by 0 2 0, and the next cell 0 is replaced by 0 2 0, and the third cell 0 is replaced by 0 2 0. So the output row would be 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. Which matches the example.\n\nIn example 2's input row 1 is [0, 0, 6]. The output row 1 is [0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6]. So each input cell is replaced by [0 0 6]. But how? Wait, the input cell is 0, replaced by 0 0 6? That doesn't make sense. Or perhaps each input cell is replaced by a pattern based on its value. For example, if the input cell is 0, then it's replaced by [0, 0, 6]? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input cell is replaced by a pattern of [value, value, value]. But in example 2's input row 1, the output row is [0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6]. So each input cell is replaced by [value, value, value]. For example, the first input cell is 0, replaced by 0 0 0, but the output is 0 0 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 7\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 2 0 2 0 2 0\nRow 1: 0 7 0 7 0 7\nRow 2: 2 0 2 0 2 0\nRow 3: 0 7 0 7 0 7\nRow 4: 2 0 2 0 2 0\nRow 5: 0 7 0 7 0 7\n\nSo for each input row, the output is the same row repeated three times, but with some transformation. For example, the first input row is [0, 0], and the output rows are [2 0 2 0 2 0], [0 7 0 7 0 7], etc. Wait, no. The first input row is [0, 0], and the output rows are the same as the first two rows of the output. So perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and repeating it three times in rows, and for each row, applying a transformation based on the input's value.\n\nFor example, if the input row is [a, b], then the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: [a', b', a', b', a', b'] where a' is 2 if a is 0, else 0, and b' is 2 if b is 0, else 0. But in example 1, the first input row is [0, 0], and the output row is [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each input cell, the output is generated by repeating it three times, but with a certain pattern. For example, if the input cell is 0, then it's replaced by 2, 0, 2. If the input cell is 7, then it's replaced by 0, 7, 0. So for the first input row [0, 0], the output row would be 2 0 2 0 2 0. Which fits. For the second input row [0, 7], the output row would be 0 7 0 7 0 7. Which fits.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. Each input cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern based on its value. For example:\n\n- If the input cell is 0, the pattern is 2, 0, 2.\n- If the input cell is 7, the pattern is 0, 7, 0.\n- If the input cell is 6, the pattern is 6, 0, 6.\n- If the input cell is 8, the pattern is 2, 8, 2.\n- If the input cell is 4, the pattern is 0, 4, 0.\n\nWait, let's check example 2's input. The input row 0 is [0, 0, 0]. The output row is [0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0]. So each input cell is replaced by 0 2 0. But according to the previous pattern, 0 should be replaced by 2 0 2. So this doesn't fit. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nBut in example 2's output row 0, the first input cell is 0, which is replaced by 0 2 0. So this suggests that the pattern for 0 is different. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern depends on the row in the output. For example, the first row of the output is generated by replacing each input cell with 2 0 2, the second row with 0 7 0, and so on. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each input cell, the output is generated by repeating the cell's value three times, but with a certain transformation. For example, if the input cell is 0, it's replaced by 2 0 2. If the input cell is 7, it's replaced by 0 7 0. For example, in example 1's input row 0, the output row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So each input cell is replaced by 2 0 2. For the second input row [0, 7], each input cell is replaced by 0 7 0. So the output row is 0 7 0 7 0 7. Which matches.\n\nIn example 2's input row 0 is [0, 0, 0]. So each input cell is replaced by 0 2 0. But according to the previous pattern, it should be 2 0 2. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, example 2's output row 0 is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So each input cell is replaced by 0 2 0. But that would mean that the input cell 0 is replaced by 0 2 0. So the pattern for 0 is 0 2 0. But in example 1, the input cell 0 is replaced by 2 0 2. This is conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that there's a different pattern for different cells. But that's not possible. So I must be missing something.\n\nLet me look at example 3's input:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for example, the first input row is 0 0 0 0 0. The output rows 0-2 are:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n\nSo each input cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern. For example, the first input cell (0) is replaced by 2 0 0 in row 0, but in row 1 it's replaced by 2 8 0. So this suggests that the pattern depends on the row in the output.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. This can be seen as a pattern where the value is 2 if the column is even, 0 otherwise. But the input's value is 0. So maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if the value is 0, the output is 2 if the column is even, 0 otherwise. If the value is 7, the output is 0 if the column is even, 7 otherwise.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2's input row 0 is [0, 0, 0], and the output row is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So for each column in the output, if it's even, the value is 0, and if it's odd, 2. But that would mean that the input cell is 0, and the output is 0 for even columns and 2 for odd. But in example 1, the input cell is 0, and the output is 2 for even columns and 0 for odd. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's output row 0, the first column is even (0), so it's 2, then odd (1) is 0, even (2) is 2, etc. So for input cell 0, the output is 2 for even columns, 0 for odd. For input cell 7, the output is 0 for even, 7 for odd.\n\nIn example 2's input row 0 is [0, 0, 0], and the output row is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So the first column is even (0), value is 0. Second column is odd (1), value is 2. Third column is even (2), value is 0. Fourth column is odd (3), value is 2. So this suggests that the input cell is 0, and the output is 0 for even columns and 2 for odd. But that's not matching the previous example.\n\nThis is conflicting. So perhaps the transformation depends on the row in the output. For example, even rows use one pattern, odd rows use another.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is replaced by a value based on its position in the output grid. For example, if the output cell is at (i,j), then the value is determined by the input cell (i//3, j//3), but with some transformation.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is replaced by a value based on its position in the output grid. For example, if the output cell is in an even row or column, it's 2, else 0. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 3x3 grid, but with some transformation. For example, if the input cell is 0, the 3x3 grid is filled with 2 in even positions and 0 in odd. But this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples, I think the most plausible pattern is that each input cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern based on its value. For example:\n\n- If the input cell is 0, the pattern is 2 0 2.\n- If the input cell is 7, the pattern is 0 7 0.\n- If the input cell is 6, the pattern is 6 0 6.\n- If the input cell is 8, the pattern is 2 8 2.\n- If the input cell is 4, the pattern is 0 4 0.\n\nThis would explain example 1 and example 2. Let's test this.\n\nExample 1's input row 0 is [0, 0]. The output row is [2 0 2 0 2 0], which is each input cell replaced by 2 0 2. So the first input cell is 0, replaced by 2 0 2, and the second input cell is 0, replaced by 2 0 2. But the output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So this would be 2 0 2 followed by 0 2 0? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe each input cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern, but the pattern is repeated for each input cell. So for input row [0, 0], the output row is [2 0 2, 2 0 2] concatenated, which is 2 0 2 2 0 2. But the actual output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to look for a pattern where the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 3x3 grid, but with a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is replaced by a 3x3 grid. For example, each input cell is replaced by a 3x3 grid where the center is the input cell's value, and the surrounding cells are 2 or 0 based on their position.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each input cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern based on its value. For example:\n\n- For input value 0: the pattern is 2 0 2.\n- For input value 7: the pattern is 0 7 0.\n- For input value 6: the pattern is 6 0 6.\n- For input value 8: the pattern is 2 8 2.\n- For other values, perhaps the pattern is value 0  value 0.\n\nBut this is not clear. However, given the examples, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each cell in the input grid, expand it into three cells in the output grid, where each cell is determined by the input cell's value. For example, if the input cell is 0, the output cells are 2, 0, 2. If it's 7, it's 0, 7, 0. And so on.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nThe input is a 2D list. The output must be a 6x6 grid. Wait, no. The output must be a 6x6 grid, but the input can be any size. Wait, the problem says that the input is a grid, and the output must be 6x6. But the training examples have input grids of varying sizes. For example, example 1 has input of 2x2, and output is 6x6. So the transformation must take any input grid and produce a 6x6 output.\n\nSo the input grid can be of any size, and the output is always 6x6.\n\nSo the transformation must take the input grid and produce a 6x6 grid. How?\n\nPerhaps the input is a pattern that is repeated in a certain way to create the 6x6 grid.\n\nBut how? For example, in example 1, the input is 2x2, and the output is 6x6. So perhaps the input is expanded into 3 rows and 3 columns, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the input is used to generate a 6x6 grid by expanding each cell into a 3x3 grid. But that would make the output size larger. For example, if the input is 2x2, the output would be 6x6.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about example 1. The input is 2x2. The output is 6x6. So each cell in the input is replaced by a 3x3 grid. So the input's 2x2 grid becomes 3*2=6 rows and 3*2=6 columns. So each input cell is replaced by a 3x3 block. But how?\n\nFor example, the input cell (0,0) is 0. The 3x3 block would be:\n\n2 0 2\n0 0 0\n2 0 2\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, the output for example 1's first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So this would suggest that the first row of the output is the first row of the 3x3 blocks from the input cells.\n\nBut this is getting too complex. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each input cell is expanded into a 3x3 block, and the output is generated by expanding each cell into a 3x3 block, and then taking the first 3 rows and 3 columns of the expanded grid.\n\nBut this is not clear. Alternatively, the input is expanded into a 3x3 grid, and the output is the first 3 rows and 3 columns of this expanded grid. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the input is expanded into a 3x3 grid, and the output is the first 3 rows and 3 columns of this expanded grid. But how?\n\nGiven that the output is always 6x6, perhaps the input is expanded into a 3x3 grid, and then this is repeated twice to form 6x6. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll try to write code that takes the input and for each cell, generates a 3x3 block, and then the output is formed by taking the first 3 rows and 3 columns of this expanded grid. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the input is expanded into a 3x3 grid, and the output is formed by repeating this 3x3 grid three times. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that the examples are not consistent, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor each cell in the input, generate a 3x3 block. The value in the block is determined by the input cell's value. For example, if the input cell is 0, the block is:\n\n2 0 2\n0 0 0\n2 0 2\n\nIf the input cell is 7, the block is:\n\n0 7 0\n7 7 7\n0 7 0\n\nBut this is just a guess. Then, the output is formed by taking the first 3 rows and 3 columns of this expanded grid. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the input is expanded into a 3x3 grid, and the output is formed by taking the first 3 rows and 3 columns of this expanded grid. But this would make the output size 3x3, not 6x6.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each input cell is replaced by a 3x3 block, and the output is formed by expanding the input grid into a 3x3 grid, and then repeating it twice to form 6x6.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given that, I'll try to write code that for each input cell, replaces it with a 3x3 block, and then the output is the first 3 rows and 3 columns of this expanded grid. But this is not working for example 1.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into three cells in each direction. For example, if the input is 2x2, the output is 6x6. So each input cell is expanded into 3 cells in each direction. So the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 3x3 grid, and then the output is the first 3 rows and 3 columns of this expanded grid.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nThe output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 3x3 block. For example, if the input is 2x2, the output is 6x6. Each input cell is replaced by a 3x3 block. The value in the block is determined by the input cell's value. For example, if the input cell is 0, the block is filled with 2 in even positions and 0 in odd. If the input cell is 7, the block is filled with 0 in even positions and 7 in odd.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThe code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 6x6 grid\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(6)] for _ in range(6)]\n    # For each cell in the input grid\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            # Determine the value of the input cell\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            # Expand this cell into a 3x3 block\n            for x in range(3):\n                for y in range(3):\n                    # Calculate the position in the output grid\n                    # The input cell is at (i,j), and the output is 6x6\n                    # So the block starts at (i*3, j*3)\n                    output_row = i * 3 + x\n                    output_col = j * 3 + y\n                    # Determine the value for this position\n                    if val == 0:\n                        if x % 2 == 0 and y % 2 == 0:\n                            output[output_row][output_col] = 2\n                        elif x % 2 == 1 and y % 2 == 1:\n                            output[output_row][output_col] = 0\n                        else:\n                            output[output_row][output_col] = 0\n                    elif val == 7:\n                        if x % 2 == 0 and y % 2 == 0:\n                            output[output_row][output_col] = 0\n                        elif x % 2 == 1 and y % 2 == 1:\n                            output[output_row][output_col] = 7\n                        else:\n                            output[output_row][output_col] = 0\n                    else:\n                        # For other values, assume the value is the same as input\n                        output[output_row][output_col] = val\n    return output\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, this code would generate a 6x6 grid based on the input. For example, in example 1, the input is 2x2. The output would be 6x6, with each input cell expanded into a 3x3 block.\n\nBut this is not matching the examples. For example, in example 1, the first input cell is 0. The block would be:\n\nFor x=0, y=0: 2\nx=0, y=1: 0\nx=0, y=2: 2\nx=1, y=0: 0\nx=1, y=1: 0\nx=1, y=2: 0\nx=2, y=0: 2\nx=2, y=1: 0\nx=2, y=2: 2\n\nSo the block would be:\n\n2 0 2\n0 0 0\n2 0 2\n\nBut the first row of the output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So this would be the first block (i=0, j=0) and the second block (i=0, j=1). The first block's first row is 2 0 2, the second block's first row is 2 0 2. So the first row of the output would be 2 0 2 2 0 2, which doesn't match the example. So this approach is not correct.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not be correct, but it's the best I can think of based on the examples.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is two rows:\n0 0\n0 7\n\nAnd the output is a 6x6 grid. Looking at the output, it seems like there's some repetition. The first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0, then the second row is 0 7 0 7 0 7. Then the third row is same as first, fourth same as second, and so on. So maybe the input is being used to generate a pattern that repeats every two rows. But how does the input relate to the output?\n\nWait, the input has two rows. The output has 6 rows. Maybe the input is being expanded in some way. Let's think about the output rows. The first two rows are alternating between 2 and 0, and 0 and 7. Then the same pattern repeats. So maybe the input is being used as a pattern that's repeated multiple times. But how?\n\nAnother thing: the input has two rows. The output has 6 rows. So maybe the input is being used to generate a pattern that's repeated three times. For example, the first two rows of the output are the same as the input's two rows, but modified. Wait, the input's first row is 0 0, and the output's first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So maybe each cell in the input is being expanded into a pattern. For example, the input's cell (0,0) is 0, which becomes 2 0 2 0 2 0 in the first row. But that's not exactly matching. Wait, maybe the input is a pattern that's being used to generate a larger grid by expanding each cell into a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a pattern that's used to create a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value. For example, in Example 1, the input has two rows. The output is 6 rows. So maybe the input is being used as a base pattern that's repeated multiple times. Let me think about the output for Example 1. The first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. The second is 0 7 0 7 0 7. Then the third row is same as first, fourth same as second, etc. So the output is alternating between two rows, each repeated three times. So the input's two rows are being expanded into three copies each. But how does the input's values translate into the output's values?\n\nIn the input, the first row is 0 0. The output's first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So maybe the input's value 0 is being replaced by 2 in some way. But how? Maybe the input is a pattern that's being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if the input has a cell with value 0, then in the output, it's replaced by 2 in even positions and 0 in odd? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2. The input is three rows:\n\n0 0 0\n0 0 6\n6 0 0\n\nThe output is a 9x9 grid. Looking at the output, it seems that the input's rows are being expanded into three copies each. For example, the first row of the input is 0 0 0. The output's first three rows are:\n\n0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\n0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6\n6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n\nSo the first row of the input is 0 0 0. The output's first row is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So maybe each cell in the input is being expanded into a pattern. For example, the input's cell (0,0) is 0, which becomes 0 in the output's first row, but then there's a 2 in the next positions. Hmm, maybe the input is a pattern that's being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on their position. For example, if the input has a value of 0, then in the output, it's replaced by 2 in even columns and 0 in odd? Or maybe the input is being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by 2 if it's 0, and 7 if it's 7. But that's not matching the first example.\n\nWait, in example 1, the input has 0 and 7. The output has 2 and 7. So maybe the input's value is being transformed in some way. For example, 0 becomes 2, and 7 remains 7. But why would that be? Also, in example 2, the input has 0, 0, 6. The output has 0, 2, 0, etc. So maybe 0 becomes 2, and 6 remains 6. But in example 3, the input has 0 and 8. The output has 2 and 8. So that seems to fit. So maybe the transformation is that any cell with value 0 is replaced by 2, and other values are left as is. But then how does that explain the output structure?\n\nBut looking at example 1's output, the first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So the first row of the input is 0 0. So each cell in the input is being expanded into a pattern. For example, each 0 in the input is replaced by a 2 in the output's first row, but the output's first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. Wait, that's not matching. Because the input's first row is two cells, but the output's first row is six cells. So maybe the input is being used as a pattern that's being expanded into a larger grid. For example, each cell in the input is expanded into three cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a pattern that's being used to generate a grid where each cell is repeated multiple times. For example, in example 1, the input has two rows. The output has six rows. So maybe the input is being used as a base pattern that's repeated three times. But the output's rows are alternating between two patterns. So maybe the input is being used to generate a grid where each row is repeated multiple times. For example, the first two rows of the output are the same as the input's two rows, but with some modification. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a pattern that's being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if the input has a cell with value 0, then in the output, it's replaced by 2 in even positions and 0 in odd. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 2's input:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 6\nRow 2: 6 0 0\n\nThe output is a 9x9 grid. The first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow 1: 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6\nRow 2: 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n\nSo each row of the input is being expanded into three rows. For example, the first input row (0 0 0) becomes three rows. The first row of the output is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So each cell in the input is being expanded into three cells. For example, the first cell (0,0) is 0, which becomes 0 in the first position of the output row, then 2 in the second, then 0 in the third? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the input is being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain pattern. For example, if the input cell is 0, then in the output, it's replaced by 0 followed by 2 and 0, but that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 3x3 grid. But that's not matching the size. For example, example 1's input is 2x2, and the output is 6x6. So 2x2 becomes 6x6. That's a 3x3 expansion. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1. The output is 6 rows. Each row is 6 elements. The input is 2 rows. So maybe the output is generated by repeating the input's rows in some pattern. For example, the output is the input's rows repeated three times, but with some modifications. But the first row of the output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. The input's first row is 0 0. So maybe each cell in the input is being expanded into three cells. For example, the first row of the input is 0 0. So each cell is expanded into 2 0 2 0 2 0. Wait, that's 6 elements. So maybe each cell in the input is replaced by a pattern of 2 0 2 0 2 0, but that's not matching. Wait, the input has two cells, and the output has six cells in the first row. So maybe each input cell is expanded into three cells. For example, 0 becomes 2 0 2. Then the first row of the input is 0 0, so the first row of the output is 2 0 2 2 0 2. But the actual output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is repeated in a certain way. For example, the input is a pattern that's being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, in example 1, the input has two rows. The output is 6 rows. So maybe the input is being used as a base pattern that's repeated three times. For example, the first two rows of the output are the same as the input's rows, but modified. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's output: the first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. The second row is 0 7 0 7 0 7. The third row is same as first. Fourth same as second. So the output is a pattern that alternates between two rows, each repeated three times. So the input's two rows are being expanded into three copies each. But how does that relate to the input's values?\n\nIn the input, the first row is 0 0. The output's first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So maybe each cell in the input is being replaced by a pattern that alternates between 2 and 0. For example, if the input cell is 0, then in the output, it's replaced by 2 in even positions and 0 in odd. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is expanded into a 3x3 grid. But that would make the output size larger. However, the input's size is 2x2, and the output is 6x6. So 2x2 becomes 6x6. That's not a 3x3 expansion. Wait, 2*3=6. So maybe each cell in the input is expanded into three cells in each direction. So the input's rows are being repeated three times, and each cell is expanded into three cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if the cell is in an even row or column, it's 2, else 0. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's input:\n\nInput is 5 rows. The output is 15 rows. So maybe the input's rows are being repeated three times. But the output is 15 rows, which is 5*3. So that's possible. For example, the input has 5 rows, and the output has 5*3=15 rows. But how does that work with the example?\n\nIn example 3's input, the first row is 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n\nSo the first row of the input is 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first three rows are different. So maybe the input is being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a pattern. For example, if the input cell is 0, then in the output, it's replaced by 2 in certain positions and 0 in others. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is expanded into a 3x3 pattern. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has rows that alternate between two patterns. The first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. The second row is 0 7 0 7 0 7. Then the same pattern repeats. So the output is generated by repeating the input's rows, but with some transformation. For example, the input's first row is 0 0, which becomes the first two rows of the output, but with 2 and 0. Wait, no. The first row of the output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. The input's first row is 0 0. So maybe each cell in the input is expanded into three cells. For example, 0 becomes 2 0 2, but then the first row is 0 0, so the first row of the output is 2 0 2 2 0 2. But that's not matching the actual output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is being used as a pattern that's being repeated in a certain way. For example, the input's rows are being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if the input cell is 0, then in the output, the cell is 2 if it's in an even row or column. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 2. The input has three rows. The output has nine rows. Each input row is expanded into three rows. For example, the first input row is 0 0 0, which becomes three rows. The first row of the output is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. The second row is 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. The third row is 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0. So each input row is being expanded into three rows. But how?\n\nLooking at the first input row (0 0 0), the output's first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow 1: 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6\nRow 2: 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n\nSo the first input row is 0 0 0. The output's first three rows are generated by taking the input's row and expanding it into three rows. For example, the first row of the output is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So the input's cell (0,0) is 0, which becomes 0 in the first position of the output row. Then, the next cell is 0, which becomes 2 in the second position. Then 0 becomes 0 in third, then 2 in fourth, etc. This seems like a pattern where the input's cell is replaced by a pattern of 0 2 0 2 0 2... but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if the cell is 0, then in the output, it's replaced by 2 if it's in an even column, and 0 otherwise. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2's output, the first row of the output is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. This seems like the input's row is being expanded into three copies, but with some alternating values. For example, the input's row is 0 0 0. The output's first row is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So maybe each cell in the input is expanded into three cells. For example, 0 becomes 0, 2, 0. But that's not matching the first row. Alternatively, maybe the input's row is being expanded into a pattern where each cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern. For example, 0 becomes 0 2 0, and then repeated. But the input has three cells, so the output row would be 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. That matches the first row of the output. So that seems to fit.\n\nSo for example, each cell in the input is replaced by a 3-cell pattern. For example:\n\nIf the input cell is 0, then it's replaced by 0 2 0.\n\nIf the input cell is 6, then it's replaced by 6 0 0.\n\nWait, but in example 2's output, the second row is 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. So the input's second row is 0 0 6. So each cell is replaced by 0 0 6? But that would make the output row 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. Which matches the second row of the output. Similarly, the third row of the input is 6 0 0. So each cell is replaced by 6 0 0, leading to the third row of the output as 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0. Which matches the third row of the output.\n\nSo this seems to be a possible pattern. So the transformation is that each cell in the input is replaced by a 3-cell pattern. For example:\n\nIf the input cell is 0, then it's replaced by 0 2 0.\n\nIf the input cell is 6, then it's replaced by 6 0 0.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the input's first row is 0 0. The output's first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So according to this pattern, each 0 would be replaced by 0 2 0. So the first row would be 0 2 0 0 2 0. But the actual output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So that doesn't match. Hmm. So this approach works for example 2, but not example 1. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the input is being expanded into three rows and three columns. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is expanded into a 3x3 grid. But that would make the output size larger. For example, if the input is 2x2, the output is 6x6. Which is 3 times larger in each dimension. So perhaps the input is being expanded by a factor of 3 in both directions.\n\nBut how? For example, in example 1, the input is 2x2. The output is 6x6. So each input cell is expanded into a 3x3 grid. But that would mean that each cell in the input becomes a 3x3 block. But that's not matching the output. For example, the first row of the output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. If each input cell is expanded into a 3x3 block, then the first row would have 2x3=6 cells. So the first input row is 0 0. So each cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern. But the first row of the output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So that would mean that each 0 is replaced by 2 0 2. But then the first row would be 2 0 2 2 0 2. Which doesn't match the output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is being used as a pattern that's repeated in a certain way. For example, the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if the cell is in an even row or column, it's 2, else 0. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output: the first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. The second row is 0 7 0 7 0 7. So the first row has 2 in even positions (columns 0, 2, 4), and 0 in odd positions. The second row has 0 in even positions and 7 in odd. So perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's values and using them to determine the value in the output grid. For example, if the input cell is 0, then in the output, it's 2 if the column is even, else 0. If the input cell is 7, then in the output, it's 0 if the column is even, else 7. But how does that work for the input's rows?\n\nIn example 1, the input has two rows. The output has six rows. So maybe the input is being expanded into three copies of each row. For example, the input's first row is 0 0. The output's first three rows are generated by taking the input's first row and applying the pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the input is being used to generate a grid where each cell is replaced by a certain value based on its position in the output grid. For example, if the output cell is at (i,j), then the value is determined by the input's cell (i//3, j//3), but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output, the first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So the first row is alternating between 2 and 0. The second row is 0 7 0 7 0 7. So the first row is generated by the input's first row (0 0), and the second row by the input's second row (0 7). So maybe for each row in the output, it's generated by taking the input's row and applying a pattern. For example, if the input's row is [a, b], then the output's row is [a', b', a', b', a', b'] where a' is 2 if a is 0, else 0. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the input's row is being used to generate a row in the output by repeating it three times, but with some transformation. For example, the input's first row is [0, 0], and the output's first row is [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], which is like [2, 0] repeated three times. So maybe the input's row is transformed into a pattern that is repeated three times. For example, if the input's row is [0, 0], then the output row is [2, 0] repeated three times. But how does that work?\n\nIn example 1's output, the first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. Which is [2, 0] repeated three times. So the input's row is [0, 0], and the output row is [2, 0] repeated three times. But why would 0 become 2 and 0 become 0? Maybe the input's value is used to determine the value in the output's row. For example, if the input's value is 0, then the output's value is 2 if it's in an even position, 0 otherwise. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the input's value is used to determine the value in the output's row. For example, if the input's value is 0, then the output's value is 2 for even positions and 0 for odd. If the input's value is 7, then the output's value is 0 for even positions and 7 for odd. This would explain example 1's output.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. For example 1, input row 0 is [0, 0]. The output row 0 is [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]. So each cell in the input is expanded into three cells. For the first input cell (0), which is 0, the output cells are 2, 0, 2. So for even positions (0, 2, 4), it's 2, and for odd positions (1, 3, 5), it's 0. That seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, the second input row is [0, 7]. The output row is [0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7]. So for each input cell, the output cells are 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7. So for the input cell 0, which is 0, the output is 0 for even positions and 7 for odd. Wait, that's not matching. Because the input cell 0 is 0, and the output for the first cell is 0, which is even position (0), then 7 for the next cell (position 1, which is odd), then 0 for position 2 (even), etc. So this would imply that the input's value determines the value for the output's cells based on their position. For example, if the input cell is 0, then in the output, the cell's value is 2 if the position is even, else 0. If the input cell is 7, then the output's cell is 0 if even, else 7. \n\nBut how does this fit with example 2? Let's look at example 2's input. The input has rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 6\nRow 2: 6 0 0\n\nThe output is a 9x9 grid. The first three rows of the output are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow 1: 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6\nRow 2: 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n\nSo for row 0 of the input (0 0 0), the output row 0 is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So each input cell is expanded into three cells. The first input cell is 0, so the first three cells are 0, 2, 0. The second input cell is 0, so the next three cells are 0, 2, 0. The third input cell is 0, so the next three cells are 0, 2, 0. But that would make the row 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. Which matches. So this seems to fit.\n\nFor row 1 of the input, which is 0 0 6. The output row 1 is 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. So each input cell is expanded into three cells. The first input cell is 0, so the first three cells are 0, 0, 6? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, the output row is 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. So for the first input cell (0), the output cells are 0, 0, 6. But that doesn't fit the previous pattern. So maybe there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the input's value determines the value for the output's cell, and the position in the output's row determines whether it's even or odd. For example, if the input cell is 0, then in the output, the cell is 2 if the position is even, else 0. If the input cell is 6, then in the output, the cell is 6 if the position is even, else 0. But that would explain example 1 and example 2.\n\nLet's test this. For example 1's input row 0: 0 0. The output row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So each input cell is 0. For each position in the output row, if it's even, 2; else 0. So the first position (0) is even, so 2. Position 1 is odd, 0. Position 2 even, 2. Etc. So that fits.\n\nFor example 2's input row 0: 0 0 0. The output row is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So for each input cell (0), the output is 0 in even positions, 2 in odd. Wait, no. The first cell in the output row is 0. But according to the rule, if the input cell is 0, the output is 2 in even positions and 0 in odd. But the first cell is even (position 0), so it should be 2. But the output is 0. So this contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the previous idea is incorrect. So what's different here?\n\nLooking at example 2's output row 0: 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. The first cell is 0. But according to the previous hypothesis, if the input cell is 0, then it should be 2. But it's 0. So that doesn't fit. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nSo maybe the rule is different. Let's think again.\n\nIn example 1's input row 0 is 0 0. The output row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So the first cell is 2. The second is 0, third is 2, fourth 0, etc. So for each input cell, the output is 2 in even positions, 0 in odd. But the input cell is 0, so the output is 2 in even positions, 0 in odd. So the first input cell (0) is replaced by a pattern of 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0. But how does that fit with the input's row being 0 0? Maybe each input cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern. So the input row has two cells, and the output row has 6 cells. So each input cell is replaced by 3 cells. For example, the first input cell (0) is replaced by 2 0 2, and the second input cell (0) is replaced by 2 0 2. So the output row would be 2 0 2 2 0 2. But the actual output row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's row is being used to generate the output row by repeating it three times, but with some transformation. For example, the input row is [0, 0], and the output row is [2, 0] repeated three times. So the output row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. That fits. So for each input row, the output row is generated by taking the input row and replacing each cell with a pattern that is repeated three times. For example, if the input cell is 0, then it is replaced by 2 0. If the input cell is 7, it is replaced by 0 7. But how does this work with the input's row?\n\nIn example 1's input row 0 is [0, 0]. So the output row is [2 0] repeated three times: 2 0 2 0 2 0. Which matches.\n\nIn example 2's input row 0 is [0, 0, 0]. The output row 0 is [0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0]. So each input cell is replaced by [0 2 0]. But wait, the input row is three cells, and the output row is nine cells. So each input cell is replaced by three cells. So the input cell 0 is replaced by 0 2 0, and the next cell 0 is replaced by 0 2 0, and the third cell 0 is replaced by 0 2 0. So the output row would be 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. Which matches the example.\n\nIn example 2's input row 1 is [0, 0, 6]. The output row 1 is [0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6]. So each input cell is replaced by [0 0 6]. But how? Wait, the input cell is 0, replaced by 0 0 6? That doesn't make sense. Or perhaps each input cell is replaced by a pattern based on its value. For example, if the input cell is 0, then it's replaced by [0, 0, 6]? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input cell is replaced by a pattern of [value, value, value]. But in example 2's input row 1, the output row is [0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6]. So each input cell is replaced by [value, value, value]. For example, the first input cell is 0, replaced by 0 0 0, but the output is 0 0 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0\n0 7\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 2 0 2 0 2 0\nRow 1: 0 7 0 7 0 7\nRow 2: 2 0 2 0 2 0\nRow 3: 0 7 0 7 0 7\nRow 4: 2 0 2 0 2 0\nRow 5: 0 7 0 7 0 7\n\nSo for each input row, the output is the same row repeated three times, but with some transformation. For example, the first input row is [0, 0], and the output rows are [2 0 2 0 2 0], [0 7 0 7 0 7], etc. Wait, no. The first input row is [0, 0], and the output rows are the same as the first two rows of the output. So perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and repeating it three times in rows, and for each row, applying a transformation based on the input's value.\n\nFor example, if the input row is [a, b], then the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: [a', b', a', b', a', b'] where a' is 2 if a is 0, else 0, and b' is 2 if b is 0, else 0. But in example 1, the first input row is [0, 0], and the output row is [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each input cell, the output is generated by repeating it three times, but with a certain pattern. For example, if the input cell is 0, then it's replaced by 2, 0, 2. If the input cell is 7, then it's replaced by 0, 7, 0. So for the first input row [0, 0], the output row would be 2 0 2 0 2 0. Which fits. For the second input row [0, 7], the output row would be 0 7 0 7 0 7. Which fits.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. Each input cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern based on its value. For example:\n\n- If the input cell is 0, the pattern is 2, 0, 2.\n- If the input cell is 7, the pattern is 0, 7, 0.\n- If the input cell is 6, the pattern is 6, 0, 6.\n- If the input cell is 8, the pattern is 2, 8, 2.\n- If the input cell is 4, the pattern is 0, 4, 0.\n\nWait, let's check example 2's input. The input row 0 is [0, 0, 0]. The output row is [0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0]. So each input cell is replaced by 0 2 0. But according to the previous pattern, 0 should be replaced by 2 0 2. So this doesn't fit. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nBut in example 2's output row 0, the first input cell is 0, which is replaced by 0 2 0. So this suggests that the pattern for 0 is different. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern depends on the row in the output. For example, the first row of the output is generated by replacing each input cell with 2 0 2, the second row with 0 7 0, and so on. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each input cell, the output is generated by repeating the cell's value three times, but with a certain transformation. For example, if the input cell is 0, it's replaced by 2 0 2. If the input cell is 7, it's replaced by 0 7 0. For example, in example 1's input row 0, the output row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So each input cell is replaced by 2 0 2. For the second input row [0, 7], each input cell is replaced by 0 7 0. So the output row is 0 7 0 7 0 7. Which matches.\n\nIn example 2's input row 0 is [0, 0, 0]. So each input cell is replaced by 0 2 0. But according to the previous pattern, it should be 2 0 2. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, example 2's output row 0 is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So each input cell is replaced by 0 2 0. But that would mean that the input cell 0 is replaced by 0 2 0. So the pattern for 0 is 0 2 0. But in example 1, the input cell 0 is replaced by 2 0 2. This is conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that there's a different pattern for different cells. But that's not possible. So I must be missing something.\n\nLet me look at example 3's input:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for example, the first input row is 0 0 0 0 0. The output rows 0-2 are:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n\nSo each input cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern. For example, the first input cell (0) is replaced by 2 0 0 in row 0, but in row 1 it's replaced by 2 8 0. So this suggests that the pattern depends on the row in the output.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. This can be seen as a pattern where the value is 2 if the column is even, 0 otherwise. But the input's value is 0. So maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if the value is 0, the output is 2 if the column is even, 0 otherwise. If the value is 7, the output is 0 if the column is even, 7 otherwise.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2's input row 0 is [0, 0, 0], and the output row is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So for each column in the output, if it's even, the value is 0, and if it's odd, 2. But that would mean that the input cell is 0, and the output is 0 for even columns and 2 for odd. But in example 1, the input cell is 0, and the output is 2 for even columns and 0 for odd. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's output row 0, the first column is even (0), so it's 2, then odd (1) is 0, even (2) is 2, etc. So for input cell 0, the output is 2 for even columns, 0 for odd. For input cell 7, the output is 0 for even, 7 for odd.\n\nIn example 2's input row 0 is [0, 0, 0], and the output row is 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0. So the first column is even (0), value is 0. Second column is odd (1), value is 2. Third column is even (2), value is 0. Fourth column is odd (3), value is 2. So this suggests that the input cell is 0, and the output is 0 for even columns and 2 for odd. But that's not matching the previous example.\n\nThis is conflicting. So perhaps the transformation depends on the row in the output. For example, even rows use one pattern, odd rows use another.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is replaced by a value based on its position in the output grid. For example, if the output cell is at (i,j), then the value is determined by the input cell (i//3, j//3), but with some transformation.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is replaced by a value based on its position in the output grid. For example, if the output cell is in an even row or column, it's 2, else 0. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 3x3 grid, but with some transformation. For example, if the input cell is 0, the 3x3 grid is filled with 2 in even positions and 0 in odd. But this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples, I think the most plausible pattern is that each input cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern based on its value. For example:\n\n- If the input cell is 0, the pattern is 2 0 2.\n- If the input cell is 7, the pattern is 0 7 0.\n- If the input cell is 6, the pattern is 6 0 6.\n- If the input cell is 8, the pattern is 2 8 2.\n- If the input cell is 4, the pattern is 0 4 0.\n\nThis would explain example 1 and example 2. Let's test this.\n\nExample 1's input row 0 is [0, 0]. The output row is [2 0 2 0 2 0], which is each input cell replaced by 2 0 2. So the first input cell is 0, replaced by 2 0 2, and the second input cell is 0, replaced by 2 0 2. But the output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So this would be 2 0 2 followed by 0 2 0? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe each input cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern, but the pattern is repeated for each input cell. So for input row [0, 0], the output row is [2 0 2, 2 0 2] concatenated, which is 2 0 2 2 0 2. But the actual output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to look for a pattern where the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 3x3 grid, but with a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is replaced by a 3x3 grid. For example, each input cell is replaced by a 3x3 grid where the center is the input cell's value, and the surrounding cells are 2 or 0 based on their position.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each input cell is replaced by a 3-cell pattern based on its value. For example:\n\n- For input value 0: the pattern is 2 0 2.\n- For input value 7: the pattern is 0 7 0.\n- For input value 6: the pattern is 6 0 6.\n- For input value 8: the pattern is 2 8 2.\n- For other values, perhaps the pattern is value 0  value 0.\n\nBut this is not clear. However, given the examples, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each cell in the input grid, expand it into three cells in the output grid, where each cell is determined by the input cell's value. For example, if the input cell is 0, the output cells are 2, 0, 2. If it's 7, it's 0, 7, 0. And so on.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nThe input is a 2D list. The output must be a 6x6 grid. Wait, no. The output must be a 6x6 grid, but the input can be any size. Wait, the problem says that the input is a grid, and the output must be 6x6. But the training examples have input grids of varying sizes. For example, example 1 has input of 2x2, and output is 6x6. So the transformation must take any input grid and produce a 6x6 output.\n\nSo the input grid can be of any size, and the output is always 6x6.\n\nSo the transformation must take the input grid and produce a 6x6 grid. How?\n\nPerhaps the input is a pattern that is repeated in a certain way to create the 6x6 grid.\n\nBut how? For example, in example 1, the input is 2x2, and the output is 6x6. So perhaps the input is expanded into 3 rows and 3 columns, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the input is used to generate a 6x6 grid by expanding each cell into a 3x3 grid. But that would make the output size larger. For example, if the input is 2x2, the output would be 6x6.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about example 1. The input is 2x2. The output is 6x6. So each cell in the input is replaced by a 3x3 grid. So the input's 2x2 grid becomes 3*2=6 rows and 3*2=6 columns. So each input cell is replaced by a 3x3 block. But how?\n\nFor example, the input cell (0,0) is 0. The 3x3 block would be:\n\n2 0 2\n0 0 0\n2 0 2\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, the output for example 1's first row is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So this would suggest that the first row of the output is the first row of the 3x3 blocks from the input cells.\n\nBut this is getting too complex. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each input cell is expanded into a 3x3 block, and the output is generated by expanding each cell into a 3x3 block, and then taking the first 3 rows and 3 columns of the expanded grid.\n\nBut this is not clear. Alternatively, the input is expanded into a 3x3 grid, and the output is the first 3 rows and 3 columns of this expanded grid. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the input is expanded into a 3x3 grid, and the output is the first 3 rows and 3 columns of this expanded grid. But how?\n\nGiven that the output is always 6x6, perhaps the input is expanded into a 3x3 grid, and then this is repeated twice to form 6x6. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll try to write code that takes the input and for each cell, generates a 3x3 block, and then the output is formed by taking the first 3 rows and 3 columns of this expanded grid. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the input is expanded into a 3x3 grid, and the output is formed by repeating this 3x3 grid three times. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that the examples are not consistent, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor each cell in the input, generate a 3x3 block. The value in the block is determined by the input cell's value. For example, if the input cell is 0, the block is:\n\n2 0 2\n0 0 0\n2 0 2\n\nIf the input cell is 7, the block is:\n\n0 7 0\n7 7 7\n0 7 0\n\nBut this is just a guess. Then, the output is formed by taking the first 3 rows and 3 columns of this expanded grid. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the input is expanded into a 3x3 grid, and the output is formed by taking the first 3 rows and 3 columns of this expanded grid. But this would make the output size 3x3, not 6x6.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each input cell is replaced by a 3x3 block, and the output is formed by expanding the input grid into a 3x3 grid, and then repeating it twice to form 6x6.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given that, I'll try to write code that for each input cell, replaces it with a 3x3 block, and then the output is the first 3 rows and 3 columns of this expanded grid. But this is not working for example 1.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into three cells in each direction. For example, if the input is 2x2, the output is 6x6. So each input cell is expanded into 3 cells in each direction. So the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 3x3 grid, and then the output is the first 3 rows and 3 columns of this expanded grid.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nThe output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 3x3 block. For example, if the input is 2x2, the output is 6x6. Each input cell is replaced by a 3x3 block. The value in the block is determined by the input cell's value. For example, if the input cell is 0, the block is filled with 2 in even positions and 0 in odd. If the input cell is 7, the block is filled with 0 in even positions and 7 in odd.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThe code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 6x6 grid\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(6)] for _ in range(6)]\n    # For each cell in the input grid\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            # Determine the value of the input cell\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            # Expand this cell into a 3x3 block\n            for x in range(3):\n                for y in range(3):\n                    # Calculate the position in the output grid\n                    # The input cell is at (i,j), and the output is 6x6\n                    # So the block starts at (i*3, j*3)\n                    output_row = i * 3 + x\n                    output_col = j * 3 + y\n                    # Determine the value for this position\n                    if val == 0:\n                        if x % 2 == 0 and y % 2 == 0:\n                            output[output_row][output_col] = 2\n                        elif x % 2 == 1 and y % 2 == 1:\n                            output[output_row][output_col] = 0\n                        else:\n                            output[output_row][output_col] = 0\n                    elif val == 7:\n                        if x % 2 == 0 and y % 2 == 0:\n                            output[output_row][output_col] = 0\n                        elif x % 2 == 1 and y % 2 == 1:\n                            output[output_row][output_col] = 7\n                        else:\n                            output[output_row][output_col] = 0\n                    else:\n                        # For other values, assume the value is the same as input\n                        output[output_row][output_col] = val\n    return output\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, this code would generate a 6x6 grid based on the input. For example, in example 1, the input is 2x2. The output would be 6x6, with each input cell expanded into a 3x3 block.\n\nBut this is not matching the examples. For example, in example 1, the first input cell is 0. The block would be:\n\nFor x=0, y=0: 2\nx=0, y=1: 0\nx=0, y=2: 2\nx=1, y=0: 0\nx=1, y=1: 0\nx=1, y=2: 0\nx=2, y=0: 2\nx=2, y=1: 0\nx=2, y=2: 2\n\nSo the block would be:\n\n2 0 2\n0 0 0\n2 0 2\n\nBut the first row of the output is 2 0 2 0 2 0. So this would be the first block (i=0, j=0) and the second block (i=0, j=1). The first block's first row is 2 0 2, the second block's first row is 2 0 2. So the first row of the output would be 2 0 2 2 0 2, which doesn't match the example. So this approach is not correct.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not be correct, but it's the best I can think of based on the examples.\n"
