This means that a lower (later) colour is free to overwrite the\n    pixels of a higher (earlier) colour, while the reverse is impossible \u2013\n    exactly how the examples behave.\n\n    The algorithm never touches any of the originally coloured pixels,\n    therefore all pixels that were present in the input stay unchanged.\n\n    The procedure is completely generic \u2013 nothing in it depends on the\n    concrete sizes or colour sets of the three training tasks, so the same\n    function can be applied to the unseen test grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    import numpy as np\n\n    g = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = g.shape\n    res = g.copy()\n\n    # store the coordinates that belong to the *original* picture \u2013 we never touch them\n    originals = {(r, c) for r in range(h) for c in range(w) if g[r, c] != 0}\n\n    # eight queen directions\n    directions = [(-1,  0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1),\n                  (-1,  1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, -1)]\n\n    # colours in descending order\n    colours = sorted({v for v in g.flatten() if v}, reverse=True)\n\n    for colour in colours:\n        # all *original* positions of this colour\n        seeds = [(r, c) for r, c in originals if g[r, c] == colour]\n\n        for r0, c0 in seeds:\n            for dr, dc in directions:\n                r, c = r0 + dr, c0 + dc\n                # walk until we leave the grid or hit the first coloured cell\n                while 0 <= r < h and 0 <= c < w and res[r, c] == 0:\n                    r += dr\n                    c += dc\n                # now either off the board or on the first non-blank cell\n                if 0 <= r < h and 0 <= c < w and res[r, c] == colour:\n                    # draw the segment (excluding the two endpoints)\n                    rr, cc = r0 + dr, c0 + dc\n                    while (rr, cc) != (r, c):\n                        # we are allowed to overwrite colours that were drawn\n                        # earlier (they are larger) but never an original pixel\n                        if (rr, cc) not in originals:\n                            res[rr, cc] = colour\n                        rr += dr\n                        cc += dc\n\n    return res.tolist()",

This means that a lower (later) colour is free to overwrite the\n    pixels of a higher (earlier) colour, while the reverse is impossible \u2013\n    exactly how the examples behave.\n\n    The algorithm never touches any of the originally coloured pixels,\n    therefore all pixels that were present in the input stay unchanged.\n\n    The procedure is completely generic \u2013 nothing in it depends on the\n    concrete sizes or colour sets of the three training tasks, so the same\n    function can be applied to the unseen test grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    import numpy as np\n\n    g = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = g.shape\n    res = g.copy()\n\n    # store the coordinates that belong to the *original* picture \u2013 we never touch them\n    originals = {(r, c) for r in range(h) for c in range(w) if g[r, c] != 0}\n\n    # eight queen directions\n    directions = [(-1,  0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1),\n                  (-1,  1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, -1)]\n\n    # colours in descending order\n    colours = sorted({v for v in g.flatten() if v}, reverse=True)\n\n    for colour in colours:\n        # all *original* positions of this colour\n        seeds = [(r, c) for r, c in originals if g[r, c] == colour]\n\n        for r0, c0 in seeds:\n            for dr, dc in directions:\n                r, c = r0 + dr, c0 + dc\n                # walk until we leave the grid or hit the first coloured cell\n                while 0 <= r < h and 0 <= c < w and res[r, c] == 0:\n                    r += dr\n                    c += dc\n                # now either off the board or on the first non-blank cell\n                if 0 <= r < h and 0 <= c < w and res[r, c] == colour:\n                    # draw the segment (excluding the two endpoints)\n                    rr, cc = r0 + dr, c0 + dc\n                    while (rr, cc) != (r, c):\n                        # we are allowed to overwrite colours that were drawn\n                        # earlier (they are larger) but never an original pixel\n                        if (rr, cc) not in originals:\n                            res[rr, cc] = colour\n                        rr += dr\n                        cc += dc\n\n    return res.tolist()\n```"
