I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns that might help me create a transformation function.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems there are several possible transformations happening:\n\n1. Color (value) changes - numbers change in the output grid\n2. Shape and position changes - some shapes appear in different positions or sizes\n3. Size changes - some shapes appear larger, smaller, or in different proportions\n4. Orientation changes - some shapes might be rotated or reflected\n5. Positioning changes - shapes might be moved to different parts of the grid\n\nI notice that some shapes in the input grid are being transformed into different shapes in the output grid. For example, in Example 1, the 4s form a large border, which are then modified. The 2s form a vertical strip that's moved to the right.\n\nI'm not able to see a clear, consistent transformation pattern that applies to all training examples. However, I can implement some observations I can make:\n\nFirst, let's look for patterns in the first example (Example 1):\n\nInput:\n4s form a border around the edge\n2s form a vertical strip next to the 4s\n1s form a horizontal strip at the bottom\n\nOutput:\n3s and 2s are moved around\n1s are moved to the top\n2s are moved to the right\n\nIn Example 2:\n8s form a border around the edge\n3s form a vertical strip next to the 8s\n3s form a horizontal strip at the bottom\n5s form a vertical strip at the right edge\n\nOutput:\n5s are moved to the top\n3s are moved to the right\n3s are moved to the bottom\n8s are moved to the right\n\nIn Example 3:\n0s form a border around the edge\n4s form a vertical strip next to the 0s\n6s form a vertical strip next to the 4s\n3s form a vertical strip next to the 6s\n\nOutput:\n8s are moved to the top\n3s are moved to the right\n6s are moved to the bottom\n4s are moved to the right\n\nBased on these observations, I can attempt a transformation function that tries to detect and move certain shapes to new positions.\n\nI'll implement the following steps:\n\n1. Find the outermost border (values that are not part of any inner shape)\n2. Identify vertical strips (contiguous columns of values) that are adjacent to the border\n3. Identify horizontal strips (contiguous rows of values) that are adjacent to the border\n4. Move certain values to new positions based on their position relative to the border\n\nI'll implement this as a function that attempts to perform these operations. The function will not handle all cases perfectly, but it will attempt to move values based on the patterns observed.\n\nHere's my attempt at a transformation function based on these observations:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    transformed_grid = [[grid[row][col] for col in range(cols)] for row in range(rows)]\n    \n    # Find outermost border\n    border_values = set()\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if grid[row][col] != 0 and grid[row][col] != 4 and grid[row][col] != 6:\n                border_values.add(grid[row][col])\n    \n    # Try to move values based on their position relative to the border\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if grid[row][col] == 2 and (row < 2 or row > rows - 5 or col == 1):\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 3\n            if grid[row][col] == 3 and (row < 2 or row > rows - 5 or col > 1):\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n            if grid[row][col] == 4 and (row < 2 or row > rows - 5 or col == 1):\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            if grid[row][col] == 6 and (row < 2 or row > rows - 5 or col > 1):\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"
