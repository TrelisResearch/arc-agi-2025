          "Analysis:\n\n- The input grids are always 10 rows x 2 columns.\n- Each input has a single blue cell (value 1) at the last row, first column.\n- The output grids are also 10 rows x 2 columns, but with multiple blue cells arranged in a pattern.\n- The blue cells (value 1) in outputs form a zigzag or wave-like pattern along the two columns.\n- Output 1 has a checker pattern: alternating blue cells on both columns, starting at row 0 in col 0.\n- Output 2 shifts the blue cells diagonally: they move from col 0 to col 1 and back in a stepped diagonal.\n- Output 3 has a sharper diagonal line that zigzags more steeply between columns.\n- The input always only has the blue cell at bottom-left and the rest zero (black).\n- The output uses blue cells to create a zigzag wave vertically spanning all rows.\n- The hollow cells remain black (0).\n- The color in the input at bottom-left is always 1, suggesting the \"start\" or pivot point.\n- The outputs seem to create different zigzag patterns depending on training example but always spread out to fill 10 rows x 2 columns in some diagonal/wave pattern.\n- The test input again has blue cell at bottom-left corner, so the function likely needs to produce a similar zigzag pattern as output.\n\nWithout obvious additional metadata, we can produce a function that produces a zigzag pattern of blue cells (color 1) over 10 rows x 2 cols, starting at bottom-left.\n\nA simple hypothesis pattern would be:\n\n- For rows 0 to 9:\n  - If row is even, color (row, 0) blue (1)\n  - If row is odd, color (row, 1) blue (1)\n\nThis matches Output 1 exactly. It may be a safe baseline solution.\n\nAlternatively, to incorporate zigzag diagonals as seen in Outputs 2 and 3, we can produce a wave pattern:\n\n- For rows 0 to 9:\n  - col = row % 2\n\nMore complex patterns would need more info or input variants; we only have blue cell at bottom-left, so no differences to identify distinct patterns.\n\nThus I will implement the simplest consistent pattern found in Output 1:\n\n- Output grid cells = 0 or 1 (black or blue)\n- For each row:\n  - If row % 2 == 0: col 0 is blue (1)\n  - else: col 1 is blue (1)\n\nThis always produces a 10x2 grid as required.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create output grid 10 rows x 2 cols, all zeros\n    height, width = 10, 2\n    output = [[0]*width for _ in range(height)]\n    \n    # Fill blue cells in zigzag pattern as seen in Output 1\n    for row in range(height):\n        col = 0 if row % 2 == 0 else 1\n        output[row][col] = 1\n    \n    return output\n```"

              "The training examples share these features:\n\n- Each input grid is 10 rows by 1 column (10\u00d71).\n- There is exactly one colored cell (blue) in each input, always at the bottom row (index 9).\n- The output grids are all 10 rows by 2 columns (10\u00d72).\n- The output grids contain a diagonal or zigzag pattern of blue cells.\n- The diagonal pattern shifts horizontally in a particular way depending on the position of the blue cell in the input.\n\nFrom the three examples:\n\n- In Input 1, the blue cell is at row 9, col 0. Output 1 forms a vertical checkerboard pattern for 10 rows and 2 columns, starting with blue at (0,0).\n- In Input 2, the blue cell is at row 9, col 0 or col 1 (not fully clear since input width is 1?). Based on the image, seems the blue square is at bottom left of a grid wider than one column (since Input 2 input grid is wider). The output forms a more diagonal pattern from top left to bottom right.\n- In Input 3, the blue is similarly a single cell at bottom left. The output again forms a diagonal zigzag path of blue squares.\n\nHypothesis:\n- The output grid is always 10\u00d72.\n- The blue cell in the input marks the starting point (almost always at bottom left).\n- The output highlights a blue zigzag line starting from top to bottom, changing columns every row, alternating between column 0 and 1 depending on parity of the row.\n- The exact positioning corresponds to mapping each input row's marker (blue cell) into a path that alternates columns vertically.\n\nPlan to implement:\n- Create a 10\u00d72 grid initialized with 0 (black).\n- Produce a zigzag diagonal from top row (0) to bottom (9).\n- For even rows, blue cell at col 0; for odd rows, blue cell at col 1.\n- This matches output 1's checkerboard pattern.\n- For outputs 2 and 3, the pattern is slightly shifted diagonally, so I'll shift the starting column depending on the position of the blue cell in the input.\n- Since input blue cell is always at row 9 at col 0, just do the alternating columns pattern.\n\nSince the goal is a reasonable transformation covering the examples, I will implement the alternating columns pattern:\n\n- If the blue cell in the input is at the bottom left (row 9, col 0), output will be:\n  - For row in 0 to 9:\n    - If row even, output[row][0] = blue\n    - If row odd, output[row][1] = blue\n\nThis matches output 1 perfectly.\n\nFor other inputs, slight diagonal shifts are observed, but since the input in all cases seems to place the blue cell bottom-left, this simple alternating pattern fits well.\n\nI will implement this logic.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize output grid 10x2 with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Blue color value is detected from input grid (value > 0)\n    # Assume blue color is the color present in input at bottom row\n    blue = None\n    for val in grid[-1]:\n        if val != 0:\n            blue = val\n            break\n    if blue is None:\n        blue = 1  # default fallback if no color found\n    \n    # For rows 0 to 9, place blue in column 0 if even row, else column 1\n    for r in range(10):\n        c = 0 if r % 2 == 0 else 1\n        output[r][c] = blue\n    \n    return output\n```"

              "Let's analyze the examples carefully:\n\n**Grid size:**  \nAll inputs are 10x2 grids (10 rows, 2 columns). Outputs are also 10x2 grids.\n\n**Observation of input blue (non-zero) pixels:**  \n- Input 1: One blue pixel at bottom-left (row 9, col 0)  \n- Input 2: One blue pixel at bottom-left (row 9, col 0)  \n- Input 3: One blue pixel at bottom-left (row 9, col 0)\n\nSo, all inputs have a single blue pixel at bottom-left corner (position (9,0)).\n\n---\n\n**Observation of outputs:**  \nAll outputs spread blue pixels over the grid in a pattern.\n\n- Output 1: Blue pixels alternate by row along column 0 (at even rows), column 1 filled at odd rows with blue. It forms a checkerboard pattern vertically. Essentially, the entire grid columns 0 & 1 form a checkerboard pattern starting with blue at (0,0).\n\n- Output 2: Blue pixels form a zigzag pattern across the two columns:\n  - Row 0, col 0 blue\n  - Row 1, col 1 blue\n  - Row 2, col 0 blue\n  - Row 3, col 1 blue\n  ... alternating left and right, but displaced vertically from top to bottom.\n\n- Output 3: Blue pixels form a wave-like diagonal pattern starting from bottom-left to top-right in the grid:\n  - Row 0, col 1 blue\n  - Row 1, col 0 blue\n  - Row 2, col 1 blue\n  - Row 3, col 0 blue\n  ... alternating columns while moving upward\n\n---\n\n**Key insight:**  \nInput always has blue at bottom-left (row 9, col 0) \u2014 a marker. The output creates a pattern of blue pixels spread throughout the grid's two columns, with a visually could be interpreted as horizontally alternating or zigzagging pattern.\n\n---\n\n**Hypothesis:**  \n- The output grid is always 10 rows x 2 columns  \n- The output pattern is a patterned arrangement of blue pixels (say value 1 for blue).  \n- Possibly the outputs depend on either the position of blue in input or the row index.\n\nA simple function matching all:\n\n- Create a 10x2 grid of zeros  \n- For each row i in 0..9:\n  - If i % 2 == 0: set blue (1) at (i,0)  \n  - else: set blue (1) at (i,1)\n\nThis matches Output 1 exactly.\n\nFor Output 2 or 3, similar rule but shifted or flipped:\n\n- Output 2 is similar but starting with (0,0) blue then (1,1) blue etc. (same pattern)  \n- Output 3 starts with (0,1) blue then (1,0) blue, a shifted pattern\n\nSo, possibly applying offsets based on the training example, but not enough information to differentiate.\n\n---\n\n**Best guess for coding:**  \n- The output is a 10x2 grid with alternating blue pixels (value copied or mapped from input) in a checkerboard or zigzag pattern.  \n\nFor generality:\n\n- Determine if input blue pixel is at bottom left (always yes)  \n- Create output 10x2 with alternating blue pixels starting at (0,0) or (0,1) based on input.\n\nSince inputs are always the same, we can pick one pattern (the checkerboard starting at (0,0)), which matches example 1 and 2 approximately.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation plan:**  \n- Create 10x2 grid of zeros  \n- For rows 0 to 9:\n  - Col = row % 2  \n  - Set grid[row][col] = value of input pixel at (bottom_left), or fixed color blue = 1 or copy from input at that bottom-left pixel location\n\nBut note that in the visual input, the blue is color 1 in the bottom-left pixel (value varies likely from 1 to 9?). To be safe, we copy that value (the color integer) from input[9][0] and use it in output.\n\n---\n\n**Final step:**  \nWe write code that generates 10x2 grid, and for each row i puts the \"blue\" color in column i%2.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The input is 10 rows x 2 columns\n    # The blue pixel color is at bottom-left\n    blue_color = grid[9][0]\n    rows = 10\n    cols = 2\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n    for r in range(rows):\n        c = r % 2\n        transformed_grid[r][c] = blue_color\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
