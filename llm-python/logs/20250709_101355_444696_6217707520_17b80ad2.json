Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\nOutput:\n0 4 0 0 8 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 9 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 2 0 9 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 9\n0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 3 0 0 0 6 4 0\n6 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 6 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 7 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 6 0 0 5 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n8 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 8 4 0 8 0 6 0 0 2 0\n0 0 7 0 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 6 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 6 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 3 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 2 3 0 9 0 4 0 0 0 3 0 0 8\n0 0 3 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 0 0 0 9 4 9 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 6 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 1 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 1 2 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 4 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 9 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Always start by attempting to find a complete rule that solves all training examples and should generalize to the test input.\n2. If you cannot find a perfect solution, provide your best attempt at a transformation that solves as many training examples as possible - ideally more than in the best previous turn.\n3.
