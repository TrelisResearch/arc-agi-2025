    "reasoning": "**Assessing Pattern Discovery**\n\nI'm currently focused on the training examples. My goal is to extract patterns that will assist in the creation of a Python function, `transform(grid)`. I'm looking for the rule to go from input to output. I'm feeling confident in a positive outcome.\n\n\n**Evaluating Transformations & Rules**\n\nI've reviewed the initial example and am proceeding with a working hypothesis: The function simply extracts the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input grid to form the output. This appears accurate for the first test case. I'm proceeding to test this theory with the second example to validate this simple approach.\n\n\n**Synthesizing the Transformation Function**\n\nI've confidently identified the function's core behavior: extract the top-left 2x2 subgrid. The pattern holds for all provided examples. My next step is writing the function in Python. I'm ready to create the `transform(grid)` function, armed with a simple yet accurate rule.\n\n\n**Formulating Python Implementation**\n\nI've finalized the rule: extracting the top-left 2x2 subgrid. Now, I am prepared to translate my understanding into the Python code for the transform function. I will use list slicing to extract the appropriate elements. I am focusing on making the function concise and ensuring it will handle different grid dimensions that are at least 2x2.\n\n\n**Finalizing Code and Testing**\n\nI've completed the Python code based on the pattern I've found, and I'm preparing it for submission. The code is straightforward and addresses the core requirement of extracting the top-left 2x2 subgrid. I'll do a final quick test to ensure it behaves as anticipated with a few different grid sizes.\n\n\n",
