The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"spread\" or \"propagation\" of values, particularly the number 8 and 2.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 8 and 2) are \"spread\" from their original positions to adjacent cells.\n3. The output grid always has dimensions 16x22, so the transformation must maintain this size.\n4. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"infection\" or \"spread\" of values from one cell to its neighbors.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads values from cells with non-zero values to their neighbors, with some specific rules for how this spreading occurs.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern\n    spread_pattern = [\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(22):\n            # If the cell has a non-zero value, spread it to neighboring cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Apply the spread pattern\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                        if 0 <= ni < 16 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            # Spread the value to the neighboring cell\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern\n    spread_pattern = [\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(22):\n            # If the cell has a non-zero value, spread it to neighboring cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Apply the spread pattern\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                        if 0 <= ni < 16 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            # Spread the value to the neighboring cell\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"spread\" or \"propagation\" of values, particularly the number 8 and 2.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 8 and 2) are \"spread\" from their original positions to adjacent cells.\n3. The output grid always has dimensions 16x22, so the transformation must maintain this size.\n4. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"infection\" or \"spread\" of values from one cell to its neighbors.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads values from cells with non-zero values to their neighbors, with some specific rules for how this spreading occurs.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern\n    spread_pattern = [\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(22):\n            # If the cell has a non-zero value, spread it to neighboring cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Apply the spread pattern\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                        if 0 <= ni < 16 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            # Spread the value to the neighboring cell\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern\n    spread_pattern = [\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(22):\n            # If the cell has a non-zero value, spread it to neighboring cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Apply the spread pattern\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                        if 0 <= ni < 16 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            # Spread the value to the neighboring cell\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
