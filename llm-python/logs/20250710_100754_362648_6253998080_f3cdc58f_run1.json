          "Let's analyze the patterns:\n\nFrom the training examples (both textual and visual):\n\n- Input grids contain scattered colored squares all over 10\u00d710.\n- Output grids consistently show grouped vertical color stacks aligned along the left side (columns 0 and 1).\n- The output stacks each represent a sequence of colors in ascending order from 1 to 4 (red=1, blue=2, green=3, yellow=4 in general ARC color codes).\n- The vertical stacks are sorted by color code in ascending order starting from the bottom up (or top down with increasing color codes). The output builds vertical columns with color sequence 1,2,3,4 stacked.\n- The height of the vertical stacks in outputs depends on how many increasing consecutive color values appear in input but generally always places 1\u21924 sequence vertically on the left side.\n- The horizontal position where the stacked color columns appear is always on the left side of output grid.\n- Only colors 1, 2, 3, 4 appear in output; all other colors and zeros are removed.\n- The vertical stacks \u201cgrow\u201d from bottom up or top down filling from leftmost columns.\n- If multiple vertical stacks appear, they are placed adjacent horizontally on the left side (like columns 0 to 3).\n- The fourth vertical stack in outputs (only visible in example 2) is yellow (color 4) on the rightmost of these stacks.\n- The output is always 10x10.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe transformation extracts the colors 1,2,3,4 from the input grid and creates vertical stacks of these colors arranged left to right in ascending color order:\n\n- First column: vertical stack of all '1's in the input, sorted by rows ascending.\n- Second column: vertical stack of all '2's.\n- Third column: vertical stack of all '3's.\n- Fourth column: vertical stack of all '4's.\n- All other positions zero.\n- The vertical stacks fill from the bottom of the grid upwards (the bottom row is the bottom of the stack).\n- If there are fewer than 10 occurrences of that color, stack height is that number.\n- Remaining cells above the stack are 0.\n\nThis matches example outputs pretty well and suits the instructions.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation details:**\n\n- Create empty 10x10 grid (all zeros).\n- For each color from 1 to 4:\n  - Collect all positions (row indices) in input where that color appears.\n  - Sort rows in ascending order (top to bottom).\n  - Place this many color tiles vertically in output column corresponding to color-1.\n  - These tiles start at bottom row (index 9) and go upward according to count.\n- Return output grid.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize output grid 10x10 zeros\n    output = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # For colors 1,2,3,4\n    for color in range(1,5):\n        # Find all rows with this color\n        rows = [r for r in range(10) for c in range(10) if grid[r][c] == color]\n        \n        # Sort rows ascending (top to bottom)\n        rows.sort()\n        \n        count = len(rows)\n        \n        # Place vertical stack for this color in column = color-1, from bottom row upwards\n        col = color - 1\n        for i in range(count):\n            output[9 - i][col] = color\n    \n    return output\n```"

              "Let's analyze the patterns:\n\nFrom the training examples (both textual and visual):\n\n- Input grids contain scattered colored squares all over 10\u00d710.\n- Output grids consistently show grouped vertical color stacks aligned along the left side (columns 0 and 1).\n- The output stacks each represent a sequence of colors in ascending order from 1 to 4 (red=1, blue=2, green=3, yellow=4 in general ARC color codes).\n- The vertical stacks are sorted by color code in ascending order starting from the bottom up (or top down with increasing color codes). The output builds vertical columns with color sequence 1,2,3,4 stacked.\n- The height of the vertical stacks in outputs depends on how many increasing consecutive color values appear in input but generally always places 1\u21924 sequence vertically on the left side.\n- The horizontal position where the stacked color columns appear is always on the left side of output grid.\n- Only colors 1, 2, 3, 4 appear in output; all other colors and zeros are removed.\n- The vertical stacks \u201cgrow\u201d from bottom up or top down filling from leftmost columns.\n- If multiple vertical stacks appear, they are placed adjacent horizontally on the left side (like columns 0 to 3).\n- The fourth vertical stack in outputs (only visible in example 2) is yellow (color 4) on the rightmost of these stacks.\n- The output is always 10x10.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe transformation extracts the colors 1,2,3,4 from the input grid and creates vertical stacks of these colors arranged left to right in ascending color order:\n\n- First column: vertical stack of all '1's in the input, sorted by rows ascending.\n- Second column: vertical stack of all '2's.\n- Third column: vertical stack of all '3's.\n- Fourth column: vertical stack of all '4's.\n- All other positions zero.\n- The vertical stacks fill from the bottom of the grid upwards (the bottom row is the bottom of the stack).\n- If there are fewer than 10 occurrences of that color, stack height is that number.\n- Remaining cells above the stack are 0.\n\nThis matches example outputs pretty well and suits the instructions.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation details:**\n\n- Create empty 10x10 grid (all zeros).\n- For each color from 1 to 4:\n  - Collect all positions (row indices) in input where that color appears.\n  - Sort rows in ascending order (top to bottom).\n  - Place this many color tiles vertically in output column corresponding to color-1.\n  - These tiles start at bottom row (index 9) and go upward according to count.\n- Return output grid.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize output grid 10x10 zeros\n    output = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # For colors 1,2,3,4\n    for color in range(1,5):\n        # Find all rows with this color\n        rows = [r for r in range(10) for c in range(10) if grid[r][c] == color]\n        \n        # Sort rows ascending (top to bottom)\n        rows.sort()\n        \n        count = len(rows)\n        \n        # Place vertical stack for this color in column = color-1, from bottom row upwards\n        col = color - 1\n        for i in range(count):\n            output[9 - i][col] = color\n    \n    return output\n```"
