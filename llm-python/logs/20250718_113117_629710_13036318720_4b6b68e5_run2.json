          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. Numbers tend to propagate from their original positions to adjacent cells\n2. There appears to be a \"filling\" or \"expansion\" pattern where numbers spread to neighboring cells\n3. Certain numbers (like 2, 3, 5, 8) seem to spread in specific directions\n4. There's a pattern where numbers spread to adjacent cells in a way that forms continuous regions\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading numbers to adjacent cells in a way that forms continuous regions, with certain numbers spreading more than others.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the directions we'll check (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread it to adjacent cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                for dx, dy in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                    if 0 <= ni < 21 and 0 <= nj < 21:\n                        # If the new cell is zero, set it to the same value\n                        if transformed[ni][nj] == 0:\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the directions we'll check (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread it to adjacent cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                for dx, dy in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                    if 0 <= ni < 21 and 0 <= nj < 21:\n                        # If the new cell is zero, set it to the same value\n                        if transformed[ni][nj] == 0:\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. Numbers tend to propagate from their original positions to adjacent cells\n2. There appears to be a \"filling\" or \"expansion\" pattern where numbers spread to neighboring cells\n3. Certain numbers (like 2, 3, 5, 8) seem to spread in specific directions\n4. There's a pattern where numbers spread to adjacent cells in a way that forms continuous regions\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading numbers to adjacent cells in a way that forms continuous regions, with certain numbers spreading more than others.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the directions we'll check (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread it to adjacent cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                for dx, dy in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                    if 0 <= ni < 21 and 0 <= nj < 21:\n                        # If the new cell is zero, set it to the same value\n                        if transformed[ni][nj] == 0:\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the directions we'll check (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread it to adjacent cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                for dx, dy in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                    if 0 <= ni < 21 and 0 <= nj < 21:\n                        # If the new cell is zero, set it to the same value\n                        if transformed[ni][nj] == 0:\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
