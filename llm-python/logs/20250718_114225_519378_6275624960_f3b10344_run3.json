          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation often involves replacing certain values with others, especially in specific regions of the grid.\n2. There seems to be a pattern where values like 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 are replaced with other values in specific patterns.\n3. The transformation appears to be more complex than simple value replacement, involving spatial patterns and regions.\n4. There are instances where values are replaced with 8 in certain positions, and other values are replaced with 8 in other positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values with others in specific regions\n- Replacing values with 8 in certain positions\n- Maintaining the overall structure of the grid\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values with others in specific regions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    # Replace values with 8 in specific patterns\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if (i % 5 == 0 and j % 5 == 0) or (i % 5 == 0 and j % 5 == 4) or (i % 5 == 4 and j % 5 == 0) or (i % 5 == 4 and j % 5 == 4):\n                if transformed_grid[i][j] != 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values with others in specific regions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    # Replace values with 8 in specific patterns\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if (i % 5 == 0 and j % 5 == 0) or (i % 5 == 0 and j % 5 == 4) or (i % 5 == 4 and j % 5 == 0) or (i % 5 == 4 and j % 5 == 4):\n                if transformed_grid[i][j] != 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The transformation often involves replacing certain values with others, especially in specific regions of the grid.\n2. There seems to be a pattern where values like 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 are replaced with other values in specific patterns.\n3. The transformation appears to be more complex than simple value replacement, involving spatial patterns and regions.\n4. There are instances where values are replaced with 8 in certain positions, and other values are replaced with 8 in other positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values with others in specific regions\n- Replacing values with 8 in certain positions\n- Maintaining the overall structure of the grid\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values with others in specific regions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    # Replace values with 8 in specific patterns\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if (i % 5 == 0 and j % 5 == 0) or (i % 5 == 0 and j % 5 == 4) or (i % 5 == 4 and j % 5 == 0) or (i % 5 == 4 and j % 5 == 4):\n                if transformed_grid[i][j] != 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values with others in specific regions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    # Replace values with 8 in specific patterns\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if (i % 5 == 0 and j % 5 == 0) or (i % 5 == 0 and j % 5 == 4) or (i % 5 == 4 and j % 5 == 0) or (i % 5 == 4 and j % 5 == 4):\n                if transformed_grid[i][j] != 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
