The patterns seem to involve:\n\n1. Creating new regions of 3s in specific patterns\n2. Modifying existing regions of 3s\n3. Creating new regions of 3s in specific positions\n4. Removing or modifying existing 3s in certain areas\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Preserves 0s\n- Creates new regions of 3s in specific patterns\n- Modifies existing 3s in certain areas\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define patterns for new 3s\n    # These patterns are based on observations from the training examples\n    # We'll create new 3s in specific positions based on the original grid\n    \n    # First, create new 3s in the middle region\n    middle_region = (grid_np == 0) & (grid_np != 3)\n    transformed_grid[middle_region] = 3\n    \n    # Second, create new 3s in specific patterns\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on observations\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if i % 3 == 0 and j % 3 == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Third, modify existing 3s in certain areas\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on observations\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                if (i % 5 == 0 or j % 5 == 0) and (i % 7 != 0 and j % 7 != 0):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Create new 3s in the middle region\n    middle_region = (grid_np == 0) & (grid_np != 3)\n    transformed_grid[middle_region] = 3\n    \n    # Create new 3s in specific patterns\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if i % 3 == 0 and j % 3 == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Modify existing 3s in certain areas\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                if (i % 5 == 0 or j % 5 == 0) and (i % 7 != 0 and j % 7 != 0):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

Removing or modifying existing 3s in certain areas\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Preserves 0s\n- Creates new regions of 3s in specific patterns\n- Modifies existing 3s in certain areas\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define patterns for new 3s\n    # These patterns are based on observations from the training examples\n    # We'll create new 3s in specific positions based on the original grid\n    \n    # First, create new 3s in the middle region\n    middle_region = (grid_np == 0) & (grid_np != 3)\n    transformed_grid[middle_region] = 3\n    \n    # Second, create new 3s in specific patterns\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on observations\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if i % 3 == 0 and j % 3 == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Third, modify existing 3s in certain areas\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on observations\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                if (i % 5 == 0 or j % 5 == 0) and (i % 7 != 0 and j % 7 != 0):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Create new 3s in the middle region\n    middle_region = (grid_np == 0) & (grid_np != 3)\n    transformed_grid[middle_region] = 3\n    \n    # Create new 3s in specific patterns\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if i % 3 == 0 and j % 3 == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Modify existing 3s in certain areas\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                if (i % 5 == 0 or j % 5 == 0) and (i % 7 != 0 and j % 7 != 0):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
