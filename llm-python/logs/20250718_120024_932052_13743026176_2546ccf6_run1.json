          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1 first. The input has rows of numbers, mostly 0s and 6s, with some 4s and 6s. The output seems to have some changes. For instance, in the input, there are rows with 6s in the middle, and in the output, those rows are the same. But then there are other rows where 4s are introduced. Wait, looking at the input and output for Example 1, the output seems to have some 4s in certain positions. For example, in the input, there's a row like 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, and the output is the same. But then there's a row in input that has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is in the same position but maybe the 6 is shifted? Or maybe the 4s are being placed in certain positions.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 1, the 4s are in positions where the input had 4s. But in the input, there's a row with 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4s are in the same positions. But in the next row, input is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, and output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So here, the 4 in position 7 (assuming 0-based) is kept, but then there's an extra 4 in position 11? Or maybe that's a typo. Wait, the input row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 in position 11 (original input) is kept, but then in the output, position 13 is 4? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being modified based on some rule. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have 4s in positions where the input had 4s, but also in some other positions. Wait, maybe the 4s are being placed in certain positions based on the 6s. Or maybe the 4s are being added in certain patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a row with 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is the same. Then there's a row in input that's 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0, and the output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So here, the 3s are being added in some positions. For example, the input row is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0, and the output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So in the input, positions 5-7 (assuming 0-based) are 0,0,0. The output has 3,3,0. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with 3s based on neighboring cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the input has rows with 6s and 0s. The output seems to have the same 6s, but in some cases, 4s are introduced. But how?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that depends on the position of the cells. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row with 6s in the middle, and the output is the same. But in other rows, the 4s are added in certain positions. Maybe the 4s are added in positions where the input has a 6 in a certain column. Or maybe the 4s are added in positions where the input has a 6 in the same row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, in Example 2, the output seems to have 3s in certain positions where the input had 0s. For instance, the input row 3 is 0 3 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0, and the output is 0 3 3 0 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 3s are added in positions where the input had 0s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern that's based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have 4s in positions that are in certain columns. For instance, in the input, there's a row with 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is in the same position. But in another row, the input has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, and the output has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is added in position 13 (assuming 0-based). Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where in certain positions, the value is 4 if there's a 6 in the same column or row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 4s if there's a 6 in the same row or column. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a row with 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is the same. Then, in the next row, the input is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0, and the output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 3s are added in positions where the input had 0s. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with values based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have 4s in positions where the input has 6s in certain columns. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4s in positions where the input has 6s in the same row. Wait, in the input, there's a row that has 6s in the middle, and the output has 4s in certain positions. Maybe the 4s are added in positions where there's a 6 in the same row. But I need to check more examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell, if the cell is in a certain position (like column 8 or 9), then it's replaced with a 4 if there's a 6 in the same row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The test input has rows with 0s and 8s, and some 2s and 4s. The output for the test input is not given, but the user is asking to write the transformation function. However, the user hasn't provided the output for the test input. But the test input is given for context.\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided the output for the test input, I need to focus on the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again. The input has a row with 6s in the middle, and the output is the same. But in other rows, there are 4s. For example, in the input, there's a row that has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is the same. But then in another row, the input has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is added in position 13 (assuming 0-based). Wait, maybe the 4s are being added in positions where the input has a 6 in the same column. Or maybe in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s if there's a 6 in the same row. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s. For example, in the input, if a cell is 0 and there's a 6 in the same row, then replace with 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2. The input has a row with 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is the same. Then, in the next row, the input is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So in positions where the input had 0s, the output has 3s. But how?\n\nThis seems to suggest that in certain positions, the value is replaced with 3s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3s in certain positions where the input has 2s. Or maybe the pattern is based on the row number. For example, even rows have certain transformations, odd rows have others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with values based on their position relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is in a certain column, replace it with 4 if there's a 6 in the same row.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let me think of possible patterns.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 4s in certain positions. In the input, there are rows with 4s. But in the output, those 4s are kept. However, in other rows, there are 4s added. For example, in the input row that has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, the output is the same. But in another input row, there's 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is added in position 13. Maybe this is because there's a 6 in the same column. For example, in the input row, the 4 is at position 8 (assuming 0-based), and the 6 is in the same column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where there's a 6 in the same column. For example, if a cell is in column 8 and there's a 6 in the same column, then replace 0 with 4.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row or column.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's look at Example 2 again. The input has a row with 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is the same. Then, the next row is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 3s are added in positions where the input had 0s. But why?\n\nMaybe the 3s are added in positions where the cell is in a certain column. For example, columns 5, 6, 7, etc. Or maybe the 3s are added in positions where there's a 2 in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3s if there's a 2 in the same row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that certain cells are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4s in certain positions where the input has 6s. For example, in the input row that has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, the output is the same. But in another row, the input has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is added in position 13 (assuming 0-based). Maybe this is because the 6 is in the same column. For example, in the input row, the 6 is in column 4 (assuming 0-based), and the 4 is added in column 13. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row has a 6 in the same row. For example, if the cell is in a row that has a 6, then replace 0 with 4 in certain columns.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows:\n\nLooking at the two examples, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells based on their position relative to other cells. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4s in certain positions where the input had 6s in the same row. Or maybe it's about the positions of 6s and 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain columns. For example, columns 8, 9, etc. But how?\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output of Example 1, the first five rows are the same as the input. Then, there's a row with all 6s. Then, the next rows have some 4s added. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row. For example, if a cell is in a row that has a 6, then replace 0 with 4 in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row has a 6 in the same row. For example, in the input row that has 6s, the 0s are replaced with 4s in certain columns.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9. For example, in the input, if a cell is in column 8 or 9 and is 0, replace it with 4 if there's a 6 in the same row.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 5: 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6. The output is the same, so no changes here.\n\nThen, in the input row 6: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is the same. So the 4s are in positions 8 and 10 (assuming 0-based columns). But in the output, the 4s are in positions 8 and 10.\n\nIn the next row, input is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is added in position 13. But why?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each row, the 4s are added in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row. For example, if there's a 6 in column 4, then the 4 is added in column 8. Or maybe there's a pattern where the 4s are added in certain columns based on the row's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain columns. For example, columns 8 and 9. But in Example 1, the input row 6 has a 4 in column 8 and 10. The output for that row is the same. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row has a 6 in the same row. For example, in rows with 6s, replace 0s with 4s in certain positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows:\n\nIn both examples, the output seems to have 4s in positions where the input has 0s and there's a 6 in the same row. For example, in Example 1's row 6, the input has 0 in columns 0-3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17. The output has 4s in columns 8 and 10. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the column is even. Or odd.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input. The test input has rows with 0s and 8s, and some 2s and 4s. The output is not given, but perhaps the pattern can be inferred from the training examples.\n\nIn the test input, the first few rows have 0s and 8s. For example, the first row is 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0. The output for this row is probably the same as the input, but maybe some changes are made. But since the test input is for context, I can't see the output.\n\nBut given the training examples, I need to find a pattern that applies to both examples.\n\nLet me think of the transformation as follows: For each cell in the grid, if the cell is 0 and there's a 6 in the same row, replace it with 4. But this may not fit all examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input row 6 has 0s in columns 0-3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17. The output for this row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4s are in columns 8 and 10. But why those positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are added in positions where the column is 8 or 9. For example, in the input row 6, column 8 is 4, and column 9 is 6. But the output has 4 in column 8 and 10. So this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in rows where there are 6s, the 0s are replaced with 4s in certain positions. For example, in the input row that has 6s in the middle, the 0s are replaced with 4s in certain columns.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row has a 6 in the same row. For example, in rows where there are 6s, the 0s are replaced with 4s in certain columns.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the column is even. But in Example 1, the input row 6 has a 4 in column 8 (even) and 10 (even). The output for that row is the same. So that might fit.\n\nBut in the input row 6, the 4 is in column 8. The input row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is already present. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in even columns.\n\nBut in the input row 6, the 4 is in column 8 (even), and in the output, it's the same. So this might fit.\n\nLooking at Example 2: the input row 2 is 0 3 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 0 3 3 0 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 3s are added in columns 5, 6, and 8. These are odd and even columns. So this might not fit.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output for row 2 is 0 3 3 0 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 3s are added in columns 5, 6, 8. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to both examples.\n\nAnother idea: In Example 1, the output seems to have 4s in certain positions where the input had 6s in the same column. For example, in the input row 6, there's a 6 in column 4. The output has a 4 in column 8. Maybe this is a pattern where if there's a 6 in column 4, then in column 8, replace 0 with 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the 4s are added in positions where the column is 8 or 9, and the row has a 6 in column 4.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain columns based on the row's position. For example, in rows where the row index is even, replace 0s with 4s in certain columns.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row. For example, for each row, if there's a 6, then replace 0s in certain columns with 4s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s in column 4.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 if the row has 6s in column 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that applies to both examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 4s in positions where the input had 0s and there's a 6 in the same row. For example, in the input row 6, there's a 6 in column 4, and the output has 4 in column 8. So maybe the 4 is added in a column that is 4 columns away from the 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row, but the exact positions are not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps the best approach is to implement a transformation that replaces 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row or column.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row has a 6 and the column is even.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain columns based on the row's structure. For example, in rows with 6s, replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the column is even and the row has a 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that applies to both examples and try to code it.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for the row with 6s in the middle has 4s in certain positions. For example, the input row 6 has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is the same. So the 4s are already present.\n\nBut in another row, input has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is added in position 13 (assuming 0-based).\n\nMaybe this is because there's a 6 in the same column. For example, in the input row, column 13 is 0, and there's a 6 in column 13 of the same row. Wait, no. In the input row, the 6 is in column 4, 9, 13, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4 is added in positions where the column is 13, which is even.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, perhaps I should make an educated guess. For example, the transformation might be to replace 0s with 4s in certain columns based on the presence of 6s in the same row. For example, if a cell is in a row that has a 6, and the column is even, replace 0 with 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the column is 8 or 9.\n\nIn Example 1, the input row 6 has 4 in column 8 and 10. So maybe column 8 is replaced with 4 if there's a 6 in the same row.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll try to implement a function that replaces 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row.\n\nFor example, for each row, if there is a 6, then replace 0s in certain columns with 4s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, if there is a 6, then replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, if there is a 6, then replace 0s in columns 8, 9, 10 with 4s.\n\nBut I need to code this.\n\nBut given that the examples have different patterns, this might not work for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s in column 4.\n\nBut again, this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s in the same row.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, in the input grid, for each row, if the row contains a 6, then replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nBut given the examples, this might be a possible pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the row with 6s in the middle has 4s in columns 8 and 10. So perhaps this is the case.\n\nBut in the input row 6, the 4 is in column 8 and 10. So if the row has 6s, replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nBut in the input row 6, column 8 is 4 (already present), and column 9 is 6 (so not replaced). So this might not fit.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output seems to have 4s in positions where the input had 0s and the row has 6s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row has 6s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAnother idea: In the examples, the 4s are added in positions where the column is 8 or 9. For example, in Example 1, the input row 6 has 4 in column 8 and 10. The output has 4 in column 8 and 10. So maybe the 4 is added in columns 8 and 9 for rows with 6s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the transformation could be: for each row, if there is at least one 6 in the row, then replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nBut this might not work for all cases, but it's a possible pattern.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's row 6:\n\nInput row 6: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nThis row has 6s in columns 4, 9, 13. So according to the rule, replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nIn column 8, the input is 0, so replace with 4. Column 9 is 6, so no change. So the output would have 4 in column 8 and 6 in column 9. Which matches the input, as the output is the same.\n\nBut in another row, input row 7: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. This row has 6s in columns 4, 9, 13. So columns 8 and 9: column 8 is 4 (already present), column 9 is 6 (no change). But in the output, column 13 is 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, so this pattern might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are added in columns 8 and 10 for rows with 6s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to code a function that replaces 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row.\n\nFor example, for each row, if there is a 6, then replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s in column 4.\n\nBut again, this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it's not perfect.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n   if there is at least one 6 in the row:\n       for column in [8, 9]:\n           if grid[row][column] == 0:\n               replace with 4\n\nBut this might not work for all examples, but it's a possible approach.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's input row 6: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. This row has 6s, so columns 8 and 9 are 0 and 6. So replace column 8 with 4. But in the input, column 8 is 0, so it becomes 4. But in the output, it's already 4. So this would work.\n\nIn the input row 7: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. This row has 6s, so columns 8 and 9 are 4 and 6. So column 8 is 4 (no change), column 9 is 6 (no change). But in the output, column 13 is 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s in column 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nThe transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s in column 4.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 if the row has a 6 in column 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1, the rows with 6s in column 4 would be the rows where the first 6 is in column 4. For example, the first five rows have 6 in column 4. So in those rows, replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nBut in the output, the first five rows are the same as the input, so this might not be the case.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row, and also replacing 0s with 3s in certain positions based on the presence of 2s in the same row.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s with 4s in certain columns for rows with 6s, and 0s with 3s for rows with 2s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n   if the row contains 6:\n       replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4\n   elif the row contains 2:\n       replace 0s in columns 5 and 6 with 3\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nBut this is not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s, and 0s with 3s in columns 5 and 6 for rows that have 2s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(17):\n        row = transformed[i]\n        if 6 in row:\n            # Replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4\n            if row[8] == 0:\n                row[8] = 4\n            if row[9] == 0:\n                row[9] = 4\n        elif 2 in row:\n            # Replace 0s in columns 5 and 6 with 3\n            if row[5] == 0:\n                row[5] = 3\n            if row[6] == 0:\n                row[6] = 3\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nHowever, in Example 1, the output for the first five rows is the same as the input. These rows have 6s, so according to this code, they would have 4s in columns 8 and 9. But in the output, these columns are 0s. So this code would not work for those rows.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct approach is to look for a pattern where the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same column.\n\nFor example, if a cell is 0 and there's a 6 in the same column, replace with 4.\n\nBut this is a possible pattern.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's input row 6: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0.\n\nFor each 0 in this row, check if there's a 6 in the same column. For example, column 0: check if there's a 6 in column 0. If yes, replace with 4.\n\nBut in the input, column 0 has 0 in this row. If there's a 6 in column 0 in any row, then replace with 4. But in the input, column 0 has 0s in rows 0-3, 5, 6, etc. So this might not fit.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s if there's a 6 in the same column.\n\nFor example, for each cell (i, j), if grid[i][j] is 0 and there's a 6 in column j, then replace with 4.\n\nThis would mean that for each column, if there's a 6, then replace 0s in that column with 4.\n\nBut this is a possible pattern.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the first column has 0 in rows 0-3, 5, 6, etc. But there's no 6 in column 0, so no change. In column 4, there are 6s in rows 0-3, 5, 6, etc. So for each row in column 4, if the cell is 0, replace with 4. But in the input, column 4 has 6s, so no change.\n\nBut this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns where there is a 6 in the same column.\n\nBut this would mean that for each column, if there is a 6 in that column, then replace 0s in that column with 4.\n\nBut in Example 1, column 4 has 6s, so replace 0s in column 4 with 4. But in the input, column 4 has 6s, so no change.\n\nBut this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output seems to have 4s in certain positions where the input had 6s in the same row. For example, in the input row 6, there's a 6 in column 4, and the output has a 4 in column 8. So perhaps the 4 is added in a column that is 4 columns away from the 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to code a function that replaces 0s with 4s in positions where the column is 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, for each row, if there is a 6 in column 4, then replace 0s in column 8 with 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1, this would work for the input row 6, where column 4 is 6, and column 8 is 0, replaced with 4.\n\nBut in the input row 7, column 4 is 6, so column 8 is 4 (already present), and column 13 is 0, which is replaced with 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(17):\n        row = transformed[i]\n        # Check if there is a 6 in column 4\n        if row[4] == 6:\n            # Replace 0 in column 8 with 4\n            if row[8] == 0:\n                row[8] = 4\n            # Replace 0 in column 13 with 4\n            if row[13] == 0:\n                row[13] = 4\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nHowever, this would not work for all cases, but it's a possible approach.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with this code, even if it's not perfect.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1 first. The input has rows of numbers, mostly 0s and 6s, with some 4s and 6s. The output seems to have some changes. For instance, in the input, there are rows with 6s in the middle, and in the output, those rows are the same. But then there are other rows where 4s are introduced. Wait, looking at the input and output for Example 1, the output seems to have some 4s in certain positions. For example, in the input, there's a row like 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, and the output is the same. But then there's a row in input that has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is in the same position but maybe the 6 is shifted? Or maybe the 4s are being placed in certain positions.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 1, the 4s are in positions where the input had 4s. But in the input, there's a row with 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4s are in the same positions. But in the next row, input is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, and output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So here, the 4 in position 7 (assuming 0-based) is kept, but then there's an extra 4 in position 11? Or maybe that's a typo. Wait, the input row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 in position 11 (original input) is kept, but then in the output, position 13 is 4? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being modified based on some rule. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have 4s in positions where the input had 4s, but also in some other positions. Wait, maybe the 4s are being placed in certain positions based on the 6s. Or maybe the 4s are being added in certain patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a row with 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is the same. Then there's a row in input that's 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0, and the output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So here, the 3s are being added in some positions. For example, the input row is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0, and the output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So in the input, positions 5-7 (assuming 0-based) are 0,0,0. The output has 3,3,0. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with 3s based on neighboring cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the input has rows with 6s and 0s. The output seems to have the same 6s, but in some cases, 4s are introduced. But how?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that depends on the position of the cells. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row with 6s in the middle, and the output is the same. But in other rows, the 4s are added in certain positions. Maybe the 4s are added in positions where the input has a 6 in a certain column. Or maybe the 4s are added in positions where the input has a 6 in the same row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, in Example 2, the output seems to have 3s in certain positions where the input had 0s. For instance, the input row 3 is 0 3 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0, and the output is 0 3 3 0 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 3s are added in positions where the input had 0s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern that's based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have 4s in positions that are in certain columns. For instance, in the input, there's a row with 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is in the same position. But in another row, the input has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, and the output has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is added in position 13 (assuming 0-based). Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where in certain positions, the value is 4 if there's a 6 in the same column or row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 4s if there's a 6 in the same row or column. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a row with 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is the same. Then, in the next row, the input is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0, and the output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 3s are added in positions where the input had 0s. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with values based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have 4s in positions where the input has 6s in certain columns. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4s in positions where the input has 6s in the same row. Wait, in the input, there's a row that has 6s in the middle, and the output has 4s in certain positions. Maybe the 4s are added in positions where there's a 6 in the same row. But I need to check more examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell, if the cell is in a certain position (like column 8 or 9), then it's replaced with a 4 if there's a 6 in the same row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The test input has rows with 0s and 8s, and some 2s and 4s. The output for the test input is not given, but the user is asking to write the transformation function. However, the user hasn't provided the output for the test input. But the test input is given for context.\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided the output for the test input, I need to focus on the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again. The input has a row with 6s in the middle, and the output is the same. But in other rows, there are 4s. For example, in the input, there's a row that has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is the same. But then in another row, the input has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is added in position 13 (assuming 0-based). Wait, maybe the 4s are being added in positions where the input has a 6 in the same column. Or maybe in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s if there's a 6 in the same row. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s. For example, in the input, if a cell is 0 and there's a 6 in the same row, then replace with 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2. The input has a row with 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is the same. Then, in the next row, the input is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So in positions where the input had 0s, the output has 3s. But how?\n\nThis seems to suggest that in certain positions, the value is replaced with 3s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3s in certain positions where the input has 2s. Or maybe the pattern is based on the row number. For example, even rows have certain transformations, odd rows have others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with values based on their position relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is in a certain column, replace it with 4 if there's a 6 in the same row.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let me think of possible patterns.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 4s in certain positions. In the input, there are rows with 4s. But in the output, those 4s are kept. However, in other rows, there are 4s added. For example, in the input row that has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, the output is the same. But in another input row, there's 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is added in position 13. Maybe this is because there's a 6 in the same column. For example, in the input row, the 4 is at position 8 (assuming 0-based), and the 6 is in the same column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where there's a 6 in the same column. For example, if a cell is in column 8 and there's a 6 in the same column, then replace 0 with 4.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row or column.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's look at Example 2 again. The input has a row with 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is the same. Then, the next row is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 3s are added in positions where the input had 0s. But why?\n\nMaybe the 3s are added in positions where the cell is in a certain column. For example, columns 5, 6, 7, etc. Or maybe the 3s are added in positions where there's a 2 in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3s if there's a 2 in the same row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that certain cells are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4s in certain positions where the input has 6s. For example, in the input row that has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, the output is the same. But in another row, the input has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is added in position 13 (assuming 0-based). Maybe this is because the 6 is in the same column. For example, in the input row, the 6 is in column 4 (assuming 0-based), and the 4 is added in column 13. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row has a 6 in the same row. For example, if the cell is in a row that has a 6, then replace 0 with 4 in certain columns.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows:\n\nLooking at the two examples, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells based on their position relative to other cells. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4s in certain positions where the input had 6s in the same row. Or maybe it's about the positions of 6s and 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain columns. For example, columns 8, 9, etc. But how?\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output of Example 1, the first five rows are the same as the input. Then, there's a row with all 6s. Then, the next rows have some 4s added. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row. For example, if a cell is in a row that has a 6, then replace 0 with 4 in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row has a 6 in the same row. For example, in the input row that has 6s, the 0s are replaced with 4s in certain columns.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9. For example, in the input, if a cell is in column 8 or 9 and is 0, replace it with 4 if there's a 6 in the same row.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 5: 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6. The output is the same, so no changes here.\n\nThen, in the input row 6: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is the same. So the 4s are in positions 8 and 10 (assuming 0-based columns). But in the output, the 4s are in positions 8 and 10.\n\nIn the next row, input is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is added in position 13. But why?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each row, the 4s are added in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row. For example, if there's a 6 in column 4, then the 4 is added in column 8. Or maybe there's a pattern where the 4s are added in certain columns based on the row's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain columns. For example, columns 8 and 9. But in Example 1, the input row 6 has a 4 in column 8 and 10. The output for that row is the same. So maybe this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row has a 6 in the same row. For example, in rows with 6s, replace 0s with 4s in certain positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows:\n\nIn both examples, the output seems to have 4s in positions where the input has 0s and there's a 6 in the same row. For example, in Example 1's row 6, the input has 0 in columns 0-3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17. The output has 4s in columns 8 and 10. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the column is even. Or odd.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input. The test input has rows with 0s and 8s, and some 2s and 4s. The output is not given, but perhaps the pattern can be inferred from the training examples.\n\nIn the test input, the first few rows have 0s and 8s. For example, the first row is 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0. The output for this row is probably the same as the input, but maybe some changes are made. But since the test input is for context, I can't see the output.\n\nBut given the training examples, I need to find a pattern that applies to both examples.\n\nLet me think of the transformation as follows: For each cell in the grid, if the cell is 0 and there's a 6 in the same row, replace it with 4. But this may not fit all examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input row 6 has 0s in columns 0-3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17. The output for this row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4s are in columns 8 and 10. But why those positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are added in positions where the column is 8 or 9. For example, in the input row 6, column 8 is 4, and column 9 is 6. But the output has 4 in column 8 and 10. So this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in rows where there are 6s, the 0s are replaced with 4s in certain positions. For example, in the input row that has 6s in the middle, the 0s are replaced with 4s in certain columns.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row has a 6 in the same row. For example, in rows where there are 6s, the 0s are replaced with 4s in certain columns.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the column is even. But in Example 1, the input row 6 has a 4 in column 8 (even) and 10 (even). The output for that row is the same. So that might fit.\n\nBut in the input row 6, the 4 is in column 8. The input row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is already present. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in even columns.\n\nBut in the input row 6, the 4 is in column 8 (even), and in the output, it's the same. So this might fit.\n\nLooking at Example 2: the input row 2 is 0 3 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 0 3 3 0 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 3s are added in columns 5, 6, and 8. These are odd and even columns. So this might not fit.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output for row 2 is 0 3 3 0 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 3s are added in columns 5, 6, 8. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to both examples.\n\nAnother idea: In Example 1, the output seems to have 4s in certain positions where the input had 6s in the same column. For example, in the input row 6, there's a 6 in column 4. The output has a 4 in column 8. Maybe this is a pattern where if there's a 6 in column 4, then in column 8, replace 0 with 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the 4s are added in positions where the column is 8 or 9, and the row has a 6 in column 4.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain columns based on the row's position. For example, in rows where the row index is even, replace 0s with 4s in certain columns.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row. For example, for each row, if there's a 6, then replace 0s in certain columns with 4s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s in column 4.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 if the row has 6s in column 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that applies to both examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 4s in positions where the input had 0s and there's a 6 in the same row. For example, in the input row 6, there's a 6 in column 4, and the output has 4 in column 8. So maybe the 4 is added in a column that is 4 columns away from the 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row, but the exact positions are not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps the best approach is to implement a transformation that replaces 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row or column.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row has a 6 and the column is even.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain columns based on the row's structure. For example, in rows with 6s, replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the column is even and the row has a 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that applies to both examples and try to code it.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for the row with 6s in the middle has 4s in certain positions. For example, the input row 6 has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is the same. So the 4s are already present.\n\nBut in another row, input has 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is added in position 13 (assuming 0-based).\n\nMaybe this is because there's a 6 in the same column. For example, in the input row, column 13 is 0, and there's a 6 in column 13 of the same row. Wait, no. In the input row, the 6 is in column 4, 9, 13, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4 is added in positions where the column is 13, which is even.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, perhaps I should make an educated guess. For example, the transformation might be to replace 0s with 4s in certain columns based on the presence of 6s in the same row. For example, if a cell is in a row that has a 6, and the column is even, replace 0 with 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the column is 8 or 9.\n\nIn Example 1, the input row 6 has 4 in column 8 and 10. So maybe column 8 is replaced with 4 if there's a 6 in the same row.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll try to implement a function that replaces 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row.\n\nFor example, for each row, if there is a 6, then replace 0s in certain columns with 4s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, if there is a 6, then replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, if there is a 6, then replace 0s in columns 8, 9, 10 with 4s.\n\nBut I need to code this.\n\nBut given that the examples have different patterns, this might not work for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s in column 4.\n\nBut again, this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s in the same row.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, in the input grid, for each row, if the row contains a 6, then replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nBut given the examples, this might be a possible pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the row with 6s in the middle has 4s in columns 8 and 10. So perhaps this is the case.\n\nBut in the input row 6, the 4 is in column 8 and 10. So if the row has 6s, replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nBut in the input row 6, column 8 is 4 (already present), and column 9 is 6 (so not replaced). So this might not fit.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output seems to have 4s in positions where the input had 0s and the row has 6s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row has 6s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAnother idea: In the examples, the 4s are added in positions where the column is 8 or 9. For example, in Example 1, the input row 6 has 4 in column 8 and 10. The output has 4 in column 8 and 10. So maybe the 4 is added in columns 8 and 9 for rows with 6s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the transformation could be: for each row, if there is at least one 6 in the row, then replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nBut this might not work for all cases, but it's a possible pattern.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's row 6:\n\nInput row 6: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nThis row has 6s in columns 4, 9, 13. So according to the rule, replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nIn column 8, the input is 0, so replace with 4. Column 9 is 6, so no change. So the output would have 4 in column 8 and 6 in column 9. Which matches the input, as the output is the same.\n\nBut in another row, input row 7: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. This row has 6s in columns 4, 9, 13. So columns 8 and 9: column 8 is 4 (already present), column 9 is 6 (no change). But in the output, column 13 is 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, so this pattern might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are added in columns 8 and 10 for rows with 6s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to code a function that replaces 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row.\n\nFor example, for each row, if there is a 6, then replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s in column 4.\n\nBut again, this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it's not perfect.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n   if there is at least one 6 in the row:\n       for column in [8, 9]:\n           if grid[row][column] == 0:\n               replace with 4\n\nBut this might not work for all examples, but it's a possible approach.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's input row 6: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. This row has 6s, so columns 8 and 9 are 0 and 6. So replace column 8 with 4. But in the input, column 8 is 0, so it becomes 4. But in the output, it's already 4. So this would work.\n\nIn the input row 7: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. This row has 6s, so columns 8 and 9 are 4 and 6. So column 8 is 4 (no change), column 9 is 6 (no change). But in the output, column 13 is 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s in column 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nThe transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s in column 4.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 if the row has a 6 in column 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1, the rows with 6s in column 4 would be the rows where the first 6 is in column 4. For example, the first five rows have 6 in column 4. So in those rows, replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4s.\n\nBut in the output, the first five rows are the same as the input, so this might not be the case.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same row, and also replacing 0s with 3s in certain positions based on the presence of 2s in the same row.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s with 4s in certain columns for rows with 6s, and 0s with 3s for rows with 2s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n   if the row contains 6:\n       replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4\n   elif the row contains 2:\n       replace 0s in columns 5 and 6 with 3\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nBut this is not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s with 4s in columns 8 and 9 for rows that have 6s, and 0s with 3s in columns 5 and 6 for rows that have 2s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(17):\n        row = transformed[i]\n        if 6 in row:\n            # Replace 0s in columns 8 and 9 with 4\n            if row[8] == 0:\n                row[8] = 4\n            if row[9] == 0:\n                row[9] = 4\n        elif 2 in row:\n            # Replace 0s in columns 5 and 6 with 3\n            if row[5] == 0:\n                row[5] = 3\n            if row[6] == 0:\n                row[6] = 3\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nHowever, in Example 1, the output for the first five rows is the same as the input. These rows have 6s, so according to this code, they would have 4s in columns 8 and 9. But in the output, these columns are 0s. So this code would not work for those rows.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct approach is to look for a pattern where the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 6s in the same column.\n\nFor example, if a cell is 0 and there's a 6 in the same column, replace with 4.\n\nBut this is a possible pattern.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's input row 6: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0.\n\nFor each 0 in this row, check if there's a 6 in the same column. For example, column 0: check if there's a 6 in column 0. If yes, replace with 4.\n\nBut in the input, column 0 has 0 in this row. If there's a 6 in column 0 in any row, then replace with 4. But in the input, column 0 has 0s in rows 0-3, 5, 6, etc. So this might not fit.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s if there's a 6 in the same column.\n\nFor example, for each cell (i, j), if grid[i][j] is 0 and there's a 6 in column j, then replace with 4.\n\nThis would mean that for each column, if there's a 6, then replace 0s in that column with 4.\n\nBut this is a possible pattern.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the first column has 0 in rows 0-3, 5, 6, etc. But there's no 6 in column 0, so no change. In column 4, there are 6s in rows 0-3, 5, 6, etc. So for each row in column 4, if the cell is 0, replace with 4. But in the input, column 4 has 6s, so no change.\n\nBut this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in columns where there is a 6 in the same column.\n\nBut this would mean that for each column, if there is a 6 in that column, then replace 0s in that column with 4.\n\nBut in Example 1, column 4 has 6s, so replace 0s in column 4 with 4. But in the input, column 4 has 6s, so no change.\n\nBut this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output seems to have 4s in certain positions where the input had 6s in the same row. For example, in the input row 6, there's a 6 in column 4, and the output has a 4 in column 8. So perhaps the 4 is added in a column that is 4 columns away from the 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to code a function that replaces 0s with 4s in positions where the column is 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, for each row, if there is a 6 in column 4, then replace 0s in column 8 with 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1, this would work for the input row 6, where column 4 is 6, and column 8 is 0, replaced with 4.\n\nBut in the input row 7, column 4 is 6, so column 8 is 4 (already present), and column 13 is 0, which is replaced with 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(17):\n        row = transformed[i]\n        # Check if there is a 6 in column 4\n        if row[4] == 6:\n            # Replace 0 in column 8 with 4\n            if row[8] == 0:\n                row[8] = 4\n            # Replace 0 in column 13 with 4\n            if row[13] == 0:\n                row[13] = 4\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nHowever, this would not work for all cases, but it's a possible approach.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with this code, even if it's not perfect.\n"
