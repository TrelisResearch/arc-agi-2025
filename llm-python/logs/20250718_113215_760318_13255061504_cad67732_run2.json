The output grids appear to have values that are \"spread out\" from their original positions, often in a diagonal or spiral pattern.\n\nFrom the examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading values from their original positions to neighboring cells in a specific pattern, possibly in a diagonal or spiral manner.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(12)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(12):\n        for col in range(12):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread the value to neighboring cells in a diagonal pattern\n                for i in range(-1, 2):\n                    for j in range(-1, 2):\n                        if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the original cell\n                        new_row = row + i\n                        new_col = col + j\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 12 and 0 <= new_col < 12:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n    \n    return output\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(12)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(12):\n        for col in range(12):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread the value to neighboring cells in a diagonal pattern\n                for i in range(-1, 2):\n                    for j in range(-1, 2):\n                        if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the original cell\n                        new_row = row + i\n                        new_col = col + j\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 12 and 0 <= new_col < 12:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n    \n    return output\n```",

The output grids appear to have values that are \"spread out\" from their original positions, often in a diagonal or spiral pattern.\n\nFrom the examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading values from their original positions to neighboring cells in a specific pattern, possibly in a diagonal or spiral manner.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(12)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(12):\n        for col in range(12):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread the value to neighboring cells in a diagonal pattern\n                for i in range(-1, 2):\n                    for j in range(-1, 2):\n                        if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the original cell\n                        new_row = row + i\n                        new_col = col + j\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 12 and 0 <= new_col < 12:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n    \n    return output\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(12)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(12):\n        for col in range(12):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread the value to neighboring cells in a diagonal pattern\n                for i in range(-1, 2):\n                    for j in range(-1, 2):\n                        if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the original cell\n                        new_row = row + i\n                        new_col = col + j\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 12 and 0 <= new_col < 12:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n    \n    return output\n```",
