          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a bunch of 1s and 0s, and in the output, some of the 1s are replaced with 2s and 3s. Wait, in the input, there's a row where the 7th element is 2, and in the output, that position becomes 2 again. But in the output, there are some 2s and 3s in certain positions. Wait, looking at the output of Example 1, the 7th column (index 6 maybe?) has 2s and 2s. Wait, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being changed based on their position or some other criteria.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a row where the 7th element is 2, and in the output, that position is 2. But in the output, there are some rows where the middle part is changed to 2s. For example, in the output, the 7th row (row 6 in zero-based) has 2s in positions 6 and 7. Wait, maybe the pattern is that when there's a 2 in the input, it's kept, but other numbers are replaced? Or maybe it's about the positions of the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2. The input has a row with a 3 in the 11th position (index 10?), and in the output, that position becomes 3. But in the output, there are some rows where the middle part is changed to 3s. Also, in the input, there's a row with a 3 in the 11th position, and in the output, that position is 3. But in other rows, maybe the 3s are being replaced with 3s. Wait, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being replaced based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The test input has some 8s in the 7th row. The output for the test input is not given, but the problem says that the test input is for context. But perhaps the pattern is that when there's a number in a certain position, it's replaced with a higher number, or maybe it's about the positions where the number is in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, maybe the transformation is that in certain positions (like every third row or column), the numbers are replaced with 2s or 3s. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row with 0s in the middle, and in the output, those rows have 2s in the middle. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s or 3s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that whenever a cell is part of a certain pattern (like a 2x2 square), it's replaced with 2s or 3s. But that's a bit vague.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has a row where the 7th element is 2, and in the output, that's 2. But in the output, there are rows where the middle part is 2s. For instance, in the output of Example 1, the 7th row (row 6) has 2s in positions 6 and 7. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the numbers are replaced with 2s or 3s based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a row that's a multiple of 3, then replace certain values.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the input and output of Example 2. The input has a row with a 3 in the middle, and in the output, that's kept. But in the output, there are rows where the middle part is 3s. Also, in the output, there are rows where the middle part is 3s. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions (like every third row), the middle part is replaced with 3s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that whenever a cell is in a certain pattern, like if it's part of a 2x2 square, then it's replaced with 2 or 3. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the numbers in certain positions are replaced with the next number in a sequence. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the 7th column, and the output has 2 there. But in other positions, maybe the numbers are being replaced with 2s or 3s based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The test input has 8s in some positions. Maybe the transformation is that if the original number is 1, it's replaced with 2, but if it's 2, it's replaced with 3, and so on. But that's not the case in Example 1, where the 2 remains 2. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being replaced with 2s or 3s based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has rows that alternate between 1s and 0s. The output has some 2s and 3s. For example, in the output, the 7th row (row 6) has 2s in positions 6 and 7. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row of output is the same as the input's first row. But the second row is the same as the input's second row. But the third row is all zeros, same as input. Then the fourth row is same as input. But the fifth row same as input. Then the sixth row is different. Wait, the sixth row in the input is 1 1 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1. The output for that row is 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2. So in the input, the 7th and 8th elements are 2, but in the output, those positions are 2. But in the output, the entire row is 2s in the middle positions. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, like every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the input and output of Example 2. The input has a row with 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0. The output for that row is the same. But in the input, there's a row with 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 3 3 0 1 1 0 1 1 0. In the output, that row becomes 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 3 3 0 1 1 0 1 1 0. So that row is the same. But in the output, there are other rows where the middle part is 3s. For example, the 13th row in the output of Example 2 is 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0. So maybe the pattern is that in certain positions (like every third row), the middle part is replaced with 3s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that when the original value is 1, it's replaced with 2, but if it's 2, it's replaced with 3, and so on. But in Example 1, the 2 remains 2. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for positions where the input and output differ. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row where the 7th element is 2, and in the output, that's 2. But in other rows, the 7th and 8th elements are 2s. Maybe the pattern is that in certain positions (like positions where the column is even?), the numbers are replaced. Or maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s or 3s.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, there are rows where the middle part is 2s. For example, the 6th row of the output is 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2. So the middle part (columns 6 and 7) are 2s. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, like every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in the input, if the cell is in a certain position (like in the middle of a 2x2 square), it's replaced with 2 or 3. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, except for certain rows where the middle part is replaced with 2s or 3s. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row where the middle part is 2, and the output has 2s. But in other rows, the middle part is replaced with 2s. Wait, but in the output of Example 1, the 6th row (row index 5) is all 2s in the middle positions. Maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows. Let's look at the input and output of Example 1. The input has 20 rows. The output for Example 1 has rows that are the same as the input, except for rows 6, 7, 12, 13, 18, 19. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, starting from row 5 (zero-based?), the middle part is replaced with 2s. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in the input, if the row number is even, then certain positions are replaced. Or maybe the pattern is that in the input, if the cell is in a certain position (like column 6 or 7), it's replaced with 2 or 3.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The test input has 8s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is that whenever a cell is in a certain pattern, it's replaced with 2 or 3. But how?\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that in certain positions (like every third row and column), the numbers are replaced with 2 or 3. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in the middle of certain rows. Maybe the pattern is that for rows where the row index is divisible by 3, the middle part is replaced with 2s. But how to check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in certain positions where the original value is 1, it's replaced with 2, and if it's 2, replaced with 3, etc. But in Example 1, the 2 remains 2, so that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in certain positions where the original value is 1, it's replaced with 2, and if it's 0, it's replaced with 0. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, except for certain rows where the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in the middle part of rows 6, 7, 12, 13, etc. Maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has rows 0-19. The output for rows 6, 7, 12, 13, 18, 19 are modified. For example, row 6 is the 7th row (zero-based). So maybe the pattern is that every third row, starting from row 5 (zero-based?), the middle part is replaced with 2s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first 3 rows are the same as input. Then rows 3-5 are same as input. Then row 6 is modified. Then row 7 is modified. Then row 8 is same as input. Then row 9 same as input. Row 10 same as input. Row 11 same as input. Row 12 modified. So perhaps the pattern is that in rows where the row index is 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18, etc., the middle part is replaced with 2s. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, like every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, rows 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in the input, if the cell is in a row that is even, then certain positions are replaced. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where the input and output differ. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 6 (original row 6) is all 2s in the middle. So, in the input, row 6 is:\n\n1 1 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1\n\nIn the output, it's:\n\n2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2\n\nSo the first two elements are 2s, then 0, then 2s, etc. So it seems like the entire row is being replaced with 2s in the middle positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s in certain positions. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in certain positions where the original value is 1, it's replaced with 2, and if it's 0, it's replaced with 0. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in certain positions (like the middle of the grid), the numbers are replaced with 2 or 3. For example, in Example 1, the middle part of the grid is being replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for every row that is a multiple of 3, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, in Example 1, rows 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18, etc. But how to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for every row that is even, the middle part is replaced with 2s. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output of Example 2. In the input, there's a row with a 3 in the middle. In the output, that row is the same. But in other rows, the middle part is replaced with 3s. For example, in the output of Example 2, rows 12 and 13 are:\n\n3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0\n3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0\n\nSo, those rows have 3s in the middle. But the input for those rows is:\n\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 3 3 0 1 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 3 3 0 1 1 0 1 1 0\n\nSo the middle part is 3s. So in the output, those rows have 3s in the middle. So the pattern might be that in certain rows, the middle part is replaced with the same value as the input. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the middle part is replaced with 2s or 3s based on their position. For example, if the row is even, replace with 2s, if odd, replace with 3s.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The test input has a row where the 7th element is 8. The output for that row would be replaced with 2 or 3? Or maybe not. But since the test input is not given, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in certain positions where the original value is 1, it's replaced with 2, and if it's 2, replaced with 3, and so on. But in Example 1, the 2 remains 2. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions (like the middle of the grid), the numbers are replaced with 2 or 3 based on their position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of a 2x2 square, replace it with 2 or 3.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in certain rows, the middle part is replaced with 2s or 3s. For example, in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, the output of Example 1 has 2s in certain positions, and the output of Example 2 has 3s in certain positions. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in certain rows, the middle part is replaced with 2s or 3s based on the row's position.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, rows 6, 7, 12, 13, etc. are modified. These rows are every third row. So maybe the pattern is that for every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. For example, in the input, the middle of the grid is around columns 10-11. But in Example 1's output, the middle part is replaced with 2s. So maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s in certain positions. For example, in rows 5, 6, 11, 12, etc., the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach.\n\nLet me think of the transformation as follows: For each cell, if it's in a certain position (like row i and column j), then replace it with a certain value. For example, if the row is divisible by 3, then replace the cell with 2 or 3 based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, in Example 1, the rows 6, 7, 12, 13, etc. are modified. So, for rows where row number is 5, 6, 11, 12, etc., the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. For a 20x20 grid, the middle columns are around 10 and 11. So maybe in these rows, columns 6-11 are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to check that.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the first modified row (row 6) has 2s in columns 6 and 7, but the entire row is filled with 2s in the middle. Wait, the output row is:\n\n2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2\n\nSo, columns 0 and 1 are 2s, then 0, then 2s again. So perhaps the pattern is that in certain rows, the entire row is replaced with 2s in certain positions. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But in Example 1's output, the modified rows are not all 2s. For example, in row 6 of the output, the first two elements are 2s, then 0, then 2s. So that's not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But based on the examples, it seems that in certain rows, the middle part is replaced with 2s or 3s. Perhaps the rows that are multiples of 3, or rows that are even, or some other condition.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, in rows 5, 6, 11, 12, etc. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s, and in every fourth row, with 3s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for rows that are even, the middle part is replaced with 2s, and for odd rows, with 3s. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, in rows 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18. So, for these rows, the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. For a 20x20 grid, the middle is around columns 10 and 11. So, perhaps in these rows, the middle columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the modified rows have 2s in columns 6 and 7. Wait, that doesn't fit with the middle columns. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But in the output of Example 1, the modified rows are not all 2s.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a function that replaces certain positions based on their row and column indices.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input. The test input has a row with 8s in the 7th column. The output for the test input is not given, but the problem says to write the transformation function. So, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are replaced with 2s or 3s based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for every cell, if the row is even, then replace it with 2, and if it's odd, replace with 3. But that's not the case in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every cell, if it's in a certain position (like column 6 or 7), it's replaced with 2. But in Example 1, the input has a 2 in column 6, and the output has 2 there. But in other rows, it's replaced with 2s.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the examples again.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for the 6th row (row 5 in zero-based) is:\n\n2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2\n\nSo, the first two columns are 2, then 0, then 2, and so on. This seems like a pattern where the middle part is replaced with 2s. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that in every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, in rows 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18, etc., the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. For a 20x20 grid, the middle columns are around 10 and 11. But in the output of Example 1, the middle part is columns 6 and 7. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the columns 6 and 7 are replaced with 2s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row that is a multiple of 3, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, rows 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. But in Example 1, the output for row 6 is modified, which is a multiple of 3 (6 is divisible by 3). So that could be a possibility.\n\nLet's check Example 1's output. The input for row 6 is:\n\n1 1 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1\n\nThe output for row 6 is:\n\n2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2\n\nSo, the first two columns are 2s, then 0, then 2s. This seems like the entire row is being replaced with 2s in certain positions. But how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row that is a multiple of 3, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But in the output, the row is not all 2s. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s, and in every fourth row, replaced with 3s. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, if the row number is even, then replace certain positions with 2s, and if it's odd, replace with 3s. But how.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an assumption based on the examples. Let's assume that the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, rows 5, 6, 11, 12, etc. (assuming zero-based indexing). So, for these rows, the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. Maybe the middle part is columns 6 and 7. But in the output of Example 1, the middle part is columns 6 and 7, and the entire row is replaced with 2s in those positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But in the output, it's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s in the middle part. For example, in the output of Example 1, the modified rows have 2s in the middle part.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make a best guess.\n\nLet me think: In Example 1, the output for rows 6, 7, 12, 13, 18, 19 are modified. These rows are every third row starting from row 5 (zero-based). So, for rows where (row number + 1) % 3 == 0, replace the middle part with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. For example, in the output of Example 1, the middle part is columns 6 and 7. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row where the row index is divisible by 3, the middle part is replaced with 2s. So, rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. But in Example 1, the output for row 6 is modified, which is divisible by 3. So that could be a possibility.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the row 6 is modified, and the input for that row has a 2 in the middle. So, perhaps the pattern is that for rows divisible by 3, the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. For a 20x20 grid, the middle columns are around 10 and 11. But in the output of Example 1, the middle part is columns 6 and 7. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row divisible by 3, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But that's not the case.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces certain positions based on the row and column. For example, if the row is divisible by 3, then replace certain columns with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for every row, if the row is even, then replace certain columns with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for every row that is a multiple of 3 (rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18), replace the middle part with 2s. For example, in the middle columns (say, columns 6-11), replace with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle columns. For a 20x20 grid, the middle is around 10 and 11. So, perhaps columns 6-11 are replaced with 2s in those rows.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to implement this.\n\nSo, the function would loop through each row, and if the row is divisible by 3, then for each column in 6-11, replace the value with 2.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output for row 6 (which is divisible by 3) has 2s in columns 6-11. Let's check:\n\nIn the input row 6, the columns 6-11 are 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0. But in the output, those columns are 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0. So, the 4th and 5th columns (indices 6 and 7?) are 2, 2. Wait, maybe the pattern is that for rows divisible by 3, replace columns 6 and 7 with 2s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows divisible by 3, replace columns 6 and 7 with 2s.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know. Given the time, I'll proceed with this assumption and implement a function that for rows divisible by 3, replaces certain columns with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for every row, if the row is even, replace the middle columns with 2s. But again, this is a guess.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output of Example 1, the modified rows have 2s in columns 6 and 7. So, perhaps the pattern is that for every third row, the columns 6 and 7 are replaced with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the entire row is replaced with 2s in the middle. For example, the first two columns are 2, then 0, then 2, etc. So perhaps the pattern is that in every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces certain positions based on the row and column, but I'm not sure. Given the examples, I'll proceed with the following assumption: in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, rows 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18 (assuming zero-based indexing). For these rows, replace columns 6 and 7 with 2s.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's implement that.\n\nSo, the function would iterate through each row, and if the row number is 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18, then replace certain columns with 2s. But this is not general.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for every row where (row + 1) % 3 == 0, replace the middle columns with 2s.\n\nBut without knowing, this is a shot in the dark.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for every row, if the row is even, replace the middle part with 2s. But this is not based on any solid evidence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But this is not the case in the examples.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces certain positions based on the row and column. For example, in every third row, replace the middle part with 2s.\n\nBut since I'm not sure, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row.copy() for row in grid]\n    for i in range(20):\n        if i % 3 == 0:\n            for j in range(6, 12):\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. In Example 1, the row 6 is divisible by 3, so it would replace columns 6-11 with 2s. But in the output of Example 1, the row 6 has 2s in columns 6-11. So this might fit.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output has rows 12 and 13 with 3s in the middle. So this approach might not work for that example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, if it's divisible by 3, replace the middle part with 2s, and if it's divisible by 4, replace with 3s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for every row, if it's even, replace the middle part with 2s, and if it's odd, replace with 3s. But again, this is a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces every third row's middle part with 2s, and see if it fits the examples.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output for row 6 is modified, which is divisible by 3. So this might work.\n\nBut the test input has a row with 8 in the middle. If this pattern is applied, it would replace that with 2, but I don't know.\n\nBut since the problem says to write the transformation function based on the examples, I'll proceed with this approach.\n"

I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a bunch of 1s and 0s, and in the output, some of the 1s are replaced with 2s and 3s. Wait, in the input, there's a row where the 7th element is 2, and in the output, that position becomes 2 again. But in the output, there are some 2s and 3s in certain positions. Wait, looking at the output of Example 1, the 7th column (index 6 maybe?) has 2s and 2s. Wait, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being changed based on their position or some other criteria.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a row where the 7th element is 2, and in the output, that position is 2. But in the output, there are some rows where the middle part is changed to 2s. For example, in the output, the 7th row (row 6 in zero-based) has 2s in positions 6 and 7. Wait, maybe the pattern is that when there's a 2 in the input, it's kept, but other numbers are replaced? Or maybe it's about the positions of the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2. The input has a row with a 3 in the 11th position (index 10?), and in the output, that position becomes 3. But in the output, there are some rows where the middle part is changed to 3s. Also, in the input, there's a row with a 3 in the 11th position, and in the output, that position is 3. But in other rows, maybe the 3s are being replaced with 3s. Wait, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being replaced based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The test input has some 8s in the 7th row. The output for the test input is not given, but the problem says that the test input is for context. But perhaps the pattern is that when there's a number in a certain position, it's replaced with a higher number, or maybe it's about the positions where the number is in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, maybe the transformation is that in certain positions (like every third row or column), the numbers are replaced with 2s or 3s. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row with 0s in the middle, and in the output, those rows have 2s in the middle. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s or 3s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that whenever a cell is part of a certain pattern (like a 2x2 square), it's replaced with 2s or 3s. But that's a bit vague.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has a row where the 7th element is 2, and in the output, that's 2. But in the output, there are rows where the middle part is 2s. For instance, in the output of Example 1, the 7th row (row 6) has 2s in positions 6 and 7. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the numbers are replaced with 2s or 3s based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a row that's a multiple of 3, then replace certain values.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the input and output of Example 2. The input has a row with a 3 in the middle, and in the output, that's kept. But in the output, there are rows where the middle part is 3s. Also, in the output, there are rows where the middle part is 3s. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions (like every third row), the middle part is replaced with 3s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that whenever a cell is in a certain pattern, like if it's part of a 2x2 square, then it's replaced with 2 or 3. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the numbers in certain positions are replaced with the next number in a sequence. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the 7th column, and the output has 2 there. But in other positions, maybe the numbers are being replaced with 2s or 3s based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The test input has 8s in some positions. Maybe the transformation is that if the original number is 1, it's replaced with 2, but if it's 2, it's replaced with 3, and so on. But that's not the case in Example 1, where the 2 remains 2. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being replaced with 2s or 3s based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has rows that alternate between 1s and 0s. The output has some 2s and 3s. For example, in the output, the 7th row (row 6) has 2s in positions 6 and 7. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row of output is the same as the input's first row. But the second row is the same as the input's second row. But the third row is all zeros, same as input. Then the fourth row is same as input. But the fifth row same as input. Then the sixth row is different. Wait, the sixth row in the input is 1 1 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1. The output for that row is 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2. So in the input, the 7th and 8th elements are 2, but in the output, those positions are 2. But in the output, the entire row is 2s in the middle positions. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, like every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the input and output of Example 2. The input has a row with 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0. The output for that row is the same. But in the input, there's a row with 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 3 3 0 1 1 0 1 1 0. In the output, that row becomes 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 3 3 0 1 1 0 1 1 0. So that row is the same. But in the output, there are other rows where the middle part is 3s. For example, the 13th row in the output of Example 2 is 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0. So maybe the pattern is that in certain positions (like every third row), the middle part is replaced with 3s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that when the original value is 1, it's replaced with 2, but if it's 2, it's replaced with 3, and so on. But in Example 1, the 2 remains 2. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for positions where the input and output differ. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row where the 7th element is 2, and in the output, that's 2. But in other rows, the 7th and 8th elements are 2s. Maybe the pattern is that in certain positions (like positions where the column is even?), the numbers are replaced. Or maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s or 3s.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, there are rows where the middle part is 2s. For example, the 6th row of the output is 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2. So the middle part (columns 6 and 7) are 2s. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, like every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in the input, if the cell is in a certain position (like in the middle of a 2x2 square), it's replaced with 2 or 3. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, except for certain rows where the middle part is replaced with 2s or 3s. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row where the middle part is 2, and the output has 2s. But in other rows, the middle part is replaced with 2s. Wait, but in the output of Example 1, the 6th row (row index 5) is all 2s in the middle positions. Maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows. Let's look at the input and output of Example 1. The input has 20 rows. The output for Example 1 has rows that are the same as the input, except for rows 6, 7, 12, 13, 18, 19. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, starting from row 5 (zero-based?), the middle part is replaced with 2s. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in the input, if the row number is even, then certain positions are replaced. Or maybe the pattern is that in the input, if the cell is in a certain position (like column 6 or 7), it's replaced with 2 or 3.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The test input has 8s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is that whenever a cell is in a certain pattern, it's replaced with 2 or 3. But how?\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that in certain positions (like every third row and column), the numbers are replaced with 2 or 3. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in the middle of certain rows. Maybe the pattern is that for rows where the row index is divisible by 3, the middle part is replaced with 2s. But how to check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in certain positions where the original value is 1, it's replaced with 2, and if it's 2, replaced with 3, etc. But in Example 1, the 2 remains 2, so that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in certain positions where the original value is 1, it's replaced with 2, and if it's 0, it's replaced with 0. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, except for certain rows where the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in the middle part of rows 6, 7, 12, 13, etc. Maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has rows 0-19. The output for rows 6, 7, 12, 13, 18, 19 are modified. For example, row 6 is the 7th row (zero-based). So maybe the pattern is that every third row, starting from row 5 (zero-based?), the middle part is replaced with 2s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first 3 rows are the same as input. Then rows 3-5 are same as input. Then row 6 is modified. Then row 7 is modified. Then row 8 is same as input. Then row 9 same as input. Row 10 same as input. Row 11 same as input. Row 12 modified. So perhaps the pattern is that in rows where the row index is 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18, etc., the middle part is replaced with 2s. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, like every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, rows 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in the input, if the cell is in a row that is even, then certain positions are replaced. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where the input and output differ. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 6 (original row 6) is all 2s in the middle. So, in the input, row 6 is:\n\n1 1 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1\n\nIn the output, it's:\n\n2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2\n\nSo the first two elements are 2s, then 0, then 2s, etc. So it seems like the entire row is being replaced with 2s in the middle positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s in certain positions. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in certain positions where the original value is 1, it's replaced with 2, and if it's 0, it's replaced with 0. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in certain positions (like the middle of the grid), the numbers are replaced with 2 or 3. For example, in Example 1, the middle part of the grid is being replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for every row that is a multiple of 3, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, in Example 1, rows 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18, etc. But how to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for every row that is even, the middle part is replaced with 2s. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output of Example 2. In the input, there's a row with a 3 in the middle. In the output, that row is the same. But in other rows, the middle part is replaced with 3s. For example, in the output of Example 2, rows 12 and 13 are:\n\n3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0\n3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0\n\nSo, those rows have 3s in the middle. But the input for those rows is:\n\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 3 3 0 1 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 3 3 0 1 1 0 1 1 0\n\nSo the middle part is 3s. So in the output, those rows have 3s in the middle. So the pattern might be that in certain rows, the middle part is replaced with the same value as the input. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the middle part is replaced with 2s or 3s based on their position. For example, if the row is even, replace with 2s, if odd, replace with 3s.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The test input has a row where the 7th element is 8. The output for that row would be replaced with 2 or 3? Or maybe not. But since the test input is not given, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in certain positions where the original value is 1, it's replaced with 2, and if it's 2, replaced with 3, and so on. But in Example 1, the 2 remains 2. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions (like the middle of the grid), the numbers are replaced with 2 or 3 based on their position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of a 2x2 square, replace it with 2 or 3.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in certain rows, the middle part is replaced with 2s or 3s. For example, in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, the output of Example 1 has 2s in certain positions, and the output of Example 2 has 3s in certain positions. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in certain rows, the middle part is replaced with 2s or 3s based on the row's position.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, rows 6, 7, 12, 13, etc. are modified. These rows are every third row. So maybe the pattern is that for every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. For example, in the input, the middle of the grid is around columns 10-11. But in Example 1's output, the middle part is replaced with 2s. So maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s in certain positions. For example, in rows 5, 6, 11, 12, etc., the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach.\n\nLet me think of the transformation as follows: For each cell, if it's in a certain position (like row i and column j), then replace it with a certain value. For example, if the row is divisible by 3, then replace the cell with 2 or 3 based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, in Example 1, the rows 6, 7, 12, 13, etc. are modified. So, for rows where row number is 5, 6, 11, 12, etc., the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. For a 20x20 grid, the middle columns are around 10 and 11. So maybe in these rows, columns 6-11 are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to check that.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the first modified row (row 6) has 2s in columns 6 and 7, but the entire row is filled with 2s in the middle. Wait, the output row is:\n\n2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2\n\nSo, columns 0 and 1 are 2s, then 0, then 2s again. So perhaps the pattern is that in certain rows, the entire row is replaced with 2s in certain positions. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But in Example 1's output, the modified rows are not all 2s. For example, in row 6 of the output, the first two elements are 2s, then 0, then 2s. So that's not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But based on the examples, it seems that in certain rows, the middle part is replaced with 2s or 3s. Perhaps the rows that are multiples of 3, or rows that are even, or some other condition.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, in rows 5, 6, 11, 12, etc. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s, and in every fourth row, with 3s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for rows that are even, the middle part is replaced with 2s, and for odd rows, with 3s. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, in rows 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18. So, for these rows, the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. For a 20x20 grid, the middle is around columns 10 and 11. So, perhaps in these rows, the middle columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the modified rows have 2s in columns 6 and 7. Wait, that doesn't fit with the middle columns. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But in the output of Example 1, the modified rows are not all 2s.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a function that replaces certain positions based on their row and column indices.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input. The test input has a row with 8s in the 7th column. The output for the test input is not given, but the problem says to write the transformation function. So, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are replaced with 2s or 3s based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for every cell, if the row is even, then replace it with 2, and if it's odd, replace with 3. But that's not the case in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every cell, if it's in a certain position (like column 6 or 7), it's replaced with 2. But in Example 1, the input has a 2 in column 6, and the output has 2 there. But in other rows, it's replaced with 2s.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the examples again.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for the 6th row (row 5 in zero-based) is:\n\n2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2\n\nSo, the first two columns are 2, then 0, then 2, and so on. This seems like a pattern where the middle part is replaced with 2s. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that in every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, in rows 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18, etc., the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. For a 20x20 grid, the middle columns are around 10 and 11. But in the output of Example 1, the middle part is columns 6 and 7. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the columns 6 and 7 are replaced with 2s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row that is a multiple of 3, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, rows 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. But in Example 1, the output for row 6 is modified, which is a multiple of 3 (6 is divisible by 3). So that could be a possibility.\n\nLet's check Example 1's output. The input for row 6 is:\n\n1 1 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1\n\nThe output for row 6 is:\n\n2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2\n\nSo, the first two columns are 2s, then 0, then 2s. This seems like the entire row is being replaced with 2s in certain positions. But how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row that is a multiple of 3, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But in the output, the row is not all 2s. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s, and in every fourth row, replaced with 3s. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, if the row number is even, then replace certain positions with 2s, and if it's odd, replace with 3s. But how.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an assumption based on the examples. Let's assume that the pattern is that in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, rows 5, 6, 11, 12, etc. (assuming zero-based indexing). So, for these rows, the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. Maybe the middle part is columns 6 and 7. But in the output of Example 1, the middle part is columns 6 and 7, and the entire row is replaced with 2s in those positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But in the output, it's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s in the middle part. For example, in the output of Example 1, the modified rows have 2s in the middle part.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make a best guess.\n\nLet me think: In Example 1, the output for rows 6, 7, 12, 13, 18, 19 are modified. These rows are every third row starting from row 5 (zero-based). So, for rows where (row number + 1) % 3 == 0, replace the middle part with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. For example, in the output of Example 1, the middle part is columns 6 and 7. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row where the row index is divisible by 3, the middle part is replaced with 2s. So, rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. But in Example 1, the output for row 6 is modified, which is divisible by 3. So that could be a possibility.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the row 6 is modified, and the input for that row has a 2 in the middle. So, perhaps the pattern is that for rows divisible by 3, the middle part is replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. For a 20x20 grid, the middle columns are around 10 and 11. But in the output of Example 1, the middle part is columns 6 and 7. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row divisible by 3, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But that's not the case.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces certain positions based on the row and column. For example, if the row is divisible by 3, then replace certain columns with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for every row, if the row is even, then replace certain columns with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for every row that is a multiple of 3 (rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18), replace the middle part with 2s. For example, in the middle columns (say, columns 6-11), replace with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle columns. For a 20x20 grid, the middle is around 10 and 11. So, perhaps columns 6-11 are replaced with 2s in those rows.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to implement this.\n\nSo, the function would loop through each row, and if the row is divisible by 3, then for each column in 6-11, replace the value with 2.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output for row 6 (which is divisible by 3) has 2s in columns 6-11. Let's check:\n\nIn the input row 6, the columns 6-11 are 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0. But in the output, those columns are 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0. So, the 4th and 5th columns (indices 6 and 7?) are 2, 2. Wait, maybe the pattern is that for rows divisible by 3, replace columns 6 and 7 with 2s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows divisible by 3, replace columns 6 and 7 with 2s.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know. Given the time, I'll proceed with this assumption and implement a function that for rows divisible by 3, replaces certain columns with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for every row, if the row is even, replace the middle columns with 2s. But again, this is a guess.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output of Example 1, the modified rows have 2s in columns 6 and 7. So, perhaps the pattern is that for every third row, the columns 6 and 7 are replaced with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the entire row is replaced with 2s in the middle. For example, the first two columns are 2, then 0, then 2, etc. So perhaps the pattern is that in every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces certain positions based on the row and column, but I'm not sure. Given the examples, I'll proceed with the following assumption: in every third row, the middle part is replaced with 2s. For example, rows 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18 (assuming zero-based indexing). For these rows, replace columns 6 and 7 with 2s.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's implement that.\n\nSo, the function would iterate through each row, and if the row number is 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18, then replace certain columns with 2s. But this is not general.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for every row where (row + 1) % 3 == 0, replace the middle columns with 2s.\n\nBut without knowing, this is a shot in the dark.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for every row, if the row is even, replace the middle part with 2s. But this is not based on any solid evidence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but in every third row, the entire row is replaced with 2s. But this is not the case in the examples.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces certain positions based on the row and column. For example, in every third row, replace the middle part with 2s.\n\nBut since I'm not sure, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row.copy() for row in grid]\n    for i in range(20):\n        if i % 3 == 0:\n            for j in range(6, 12):\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. In Example 1, the row 6 is divisible by 3, so it would replace columns 6-11 with 2s. But in the output of Example 1, the row 6 has 2s in columns 6-11. So this might fit.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output has rows 12 and 13 with 3s in the middle. So this approach might not work for that example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, if it's divisible by 3, replace the middle part with 2s, and if it's divisible by 4, replace with 3s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for every row, if it's even, replace the middle part with 2s, and if it's odd, replace with 3s. But again, this is a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces every third row's middle part with 2s, and see if it fits the examples.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output for row 6 is modified, which is divisible by 3. So this might work.\n\nBut the test input has a row with 8 in the middle. If this pattern is applied, it would replace that with 2, but I don't know.\n\nBut since the problem says to write the transformation function based on the examples, I'll proceed with this approach.\n"
