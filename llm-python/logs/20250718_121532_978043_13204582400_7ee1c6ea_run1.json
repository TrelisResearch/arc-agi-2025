          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing between the input and output grids. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are similar but with some differences. Let me compare them row by row. For instance, the first row is the same in both input and output. But looking at the fourth row of the input: 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. The output for this row is 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. So the fourth element changed from 9 to 4, and the sixth element changed from 9 to 4. Also, the seventh element went from 9 to 4. Hmm, maybe there's some pattern here related to positions or values.\n\nLooking at the fifth row of the input: 4 4 5 0 0 4 0 5 4 4. The output is 4 4 5 0 0 9 0 5 4 4. So the sixth element changed from 4 to 9. Interesting. In the sixth row of input: 9 4 5 4 9 0 9 5 0 0. The output is 9 4 5 9 4 0 4 5 0 0. So the fourth element changed from 4 to 9, and the seventh element from 9 to 4. \n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on some rule. Let me check other examples. Let's look at Example 2. The input and output for the third row: input is 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. Output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So the fourth element changed from 8 to 6, fifth from 8 to 6, sixth from 6 to 8. So maybe there's a swap or some inversion happening in certain positions. \n\nIn Example 3, the input's third row is 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. Output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element changed from 3 to 2, fourth from 2 to 3, fifth from 2 to 3, sixth from 2 to 3. So maybe some kind of transformation where certain positions are being adjusted based on their neighbors or some other pattern.\n\nLooking at these examples, it's challenging to see a clear pattern. Let me think of possible transformations. One possibility is that certain positions are being modified based on their values. For instance, maybe if a cell is 0, it's replaced with something else. But in the first example, the input has some zeros, but the output doesn't have zeros in the same positions. Alternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping certain cells based on their position or value.\n\nAnother approach: looking for symmetry. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input has 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. The output is 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. The fourth element changed from 9 to 4, and the seventh from 9 to 4. Maybe there's a reflection or some kind of mirroring. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's modified. But how?\n\nLooking at the third example's input and output. The first row of input is 0 0 3 3 3 3 2 0 2 0. The output is the same. So maybe the first row is unchanged. But the third row of input is 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. Output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element changed from 3 to 2, fourth from 2 to 3, fifth from 2 to 3, sixth from 2 to 3. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being adjusted based on their neighbors. For example, the third element is 3, and the fourth is 2. Maybe it's swapping with some other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of rule where certain cells are replaced based on their value and their position. For instance, if a cell is 5, maybe it's replaced with something else. But looking at example 2, the input has 5s in many positions. For example, in the second row of example 2 input: 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0. The output is the same. So maybe that row is unchanged. But the third row of input is 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. The output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So the fourth element changed from 8 to 6, fifth from 8 to 6, sixth from 6 to 8. So maybe there's a swap between certain positions. For example, positions 4 and 6 are swapped. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of parity or pattern in the grid. For example, cells in even rows or columns are modified. But how?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with something else. But in example 1, the input has some 0s, but the output has some 0s as well. For example, the first row of input and output both have 0s in positions 0 and 1. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern that's applied to certain regions of the grid. For example, in example 1, the fourth row of input is modified in positions 3, 5, 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the cell's value and its neighbors. But that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the differences between input and output. Let's take example 1's fourth row. Input is [9,4,5,9,0,9,9,5,0,4]. Output is [9,4,5,4,0,4,4,5,0,4]. So the changes are at positions 3 (9\u21924), 5 (9\u21924), 6 (9\u21924). So maybe those positions are being set to 4. But why?\n\nLooking at the fifth row of example 1 input: [4,4,5,0,0,4,0,5,4,4]. Output is [4,4,5,0,0,9,0,5,4,4]. So position 5 (original 4) is changed to 9. Hmm. So maybe in some positions, the value is being replaced with 9 if certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's modified. For example, in example 1, the fourth row (index 3) has some changes. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry. For example, in example 1, the fourth row of input is [9,4,5,9,0,9,9,5,0,4]. The output is [9,4,5,4,0,4,4,5,0,4]. So the fourth element (index 3) is 9 \u2192 4, and the seventh element (index 6) is 9 \u2192 4. Also, the sixth element (index 5) is 9 \u2192 4. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 4 based on their position. For example, if the position is in the fourth row, then certain columns are modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 9, it's replaced with 4 if it's in a certain position. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of rule that applies to certain cells. For example, in example 1, the fourth row's positions 3, 5, 6 are changed. Maybe those positions are in a certain pattern. Let me check the positions:\n\nIn the fourth row (index 3), the positions that changed are 3, 5, 6. Let's see their indices:\n\nPosition 3 (column 3), 5 (column 5), 6 (column 6). Maybe there's a pattern here. For example, columns 3, 5, 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. Maybe the test input can give some clues. The test input is:\n\n7 0 1 1 7 0 0 7 7 7\n1 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 7\n1 5 0 0 1 0 1 7 5 7\n0 5 7 1 7 0 1 7 5 1\n7 5 7 7 0 1 7 1 5 1\n7 5 0 1 7 0 7 7 5 1\n1 5 7 7 1 1 1 1 5 0\n0 5 1 7 7 7 7 0 5 7\n0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 1 7 1 0 7 0 0 7 7\n\nBut since I can't see the output, I need to focus on the training examples. Maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their value and position. For example, in example 1, the fourth row's positions 3, 5, 6 are changed. Maybe those positions are in a certain pattern. For example, columns 3, 5, 6. Let's see, in the fourth row, columns 3, 5, 6. Maybe those columns are being modified based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell. For example, if a cell is 9, it's replaced with 4, or if it's 5, it's replaced with something else. But looking at example 1's fourth row, the original values are 9, 4, 5, 9, 0, 9, 9, 5, 0, 4. The output is 9,4,5,4,0,4,4,5,0,4. So the 9s in positions 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, in the fourth row, certain columns are modified. But how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's third row. The input is 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. The output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element (3) is changed to 2, fourth (2) to 3, fifth (2) to 3, sixth (2) to 3. So maybe there's a pattern where if the cell is in a certain row and column, it's modified based on its neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its row or column. For example, in even rows, certain cells are modified. But how?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is based on some kind of rule that applies to certain cells. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has certain cells changed. Let's check the positions again. The fourth row of the input is:\n\nRow 3 (assuming zero-based index), columns 0-9:\n\n[9,4,5,9,0,9,9,5,0,4]\n\nOutput row 3:\n\n[9,4,5,4,0,4,4,5,0,4]\n\nSo the changes are at columns 3, 5, 6. Let's check the values before and after:\n\nOriginal values at those positions: 9,9,9. After: 4,4,4. So those three positions are set to 4.\n\nSimilarly, in the fifth row of example 1, the original is [4,4,5,0,0,4,0,5,4,4]. Output is [4,4,5,0,0,9,0,5,4,4]. So the sixth position (index 5) is 4 \u2192 9.\n\nIn the sixth row of example 1, the input is [9,4,5,4,9,0,9,5,0,0]. Output is [9,4,5,9,4,0,4,5,0,0]. So the fourth position (index 3) is 4 \u2192 9, and seventh (index 6) is 9 \u2192 4.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their position in the grid. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced with 4 or 9 based on their position. For example, in example 1, the fourth row (row index 3) has certain columns modified. But how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 9, and its neighbors are 5, then it's replaced with 4. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the first example's output. The first row is the same as input. The second row is the same. The third row is the same. The fourth row is modified. The fifth row is modified. The sixth row is modified. The seventh row is modified. The eighth row is same. The ninth row same. The tenth row same. So maybe the transformation is applied to certain rows, like rows 3,4,5,6 (assuming zero-based index). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to certain columns. For example, in example 1, columns 3, 5, 6 are modified in row 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the sum of its row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, then modify the cell. But I need to see if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row and column, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has some cells changed to 4. In example 2, the third row has some cells changed. In example 3, the third row has some cells changed.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and whether it's part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has a 9 in column 3, which is changed to 4. Maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 4 if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 9 and has a 5 in a certain position, it's replaced with 4. But without knowing the output, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the row or column. For example, in even rows, certain cells are modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if the cell is in column 3, it's replaced with 4 if it's a certain value.\n\nBut this is too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. Let's think about the test input and try to apply some possible transformation.\n\nLooking at the test input's first row: 7 0 1 1 7 0 0 7 7 7. The output is unknown, but maybe the transformation is based on some rule that can be applied to this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the cell's value is 9, replace it with 4. But in example 1, some 9s are replaced with 4, but others are not. For example, in the first row of example 1, there are 9s, but they are not changed. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's modified. For example, in example 1, rows 3,4,5,6 are modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, then modify the cell. But how to determine what to modify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern that applies to certain cells. For example, in example 1, the fourth row (row index 3) has certain cells modified. Let me check the positions again. In row 3, columns 3,5,6 are modified. For example, column 3 is 3, column 5 is 5, column 6 is 6. These are consecutive columns. Maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the cells in columns 3,5,6 are modified. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if the cell is in row 3, then columns 3,5,6 are modified to 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and whether it's part of a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a row where the sum of the row and column indices is even, then replace it with 4.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. Let's look for other patterns.\n\nIn example 3, the third row of input is 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. The output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element (index 2) is 3 \u2192 2, fourth (index 3) 2 \u2192 3, fifth (index 4) 2 \u2192 3, sixth (index 5) 2 \u2192 3. So maybe there's a pattern where in certain rows, the cells in positions 2-5 are modified based on their value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and whether it's in a certain range. For example, if the cell is 2, it's replaced with 3 if it's in certain positions.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. For example, for each cell, if it's in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the fourth row has 4 in positions 3,5,6. In the input, those positions were 9,9,9. So maybe those positions are being set to 4. Similarly, in example 1's fifth row, position 5 is changed from 4 to 9. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 4 or 9 based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following rule: for each cell, if the row is even, then check if the column is in a certain range. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 9 and has a 5 in a certain direction, it's replaced with 4.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to determine. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that works for the examples.\n\nLooking back at example 1's fourth row, the modified positions are columns 3,5,6. These are columns 3,5,6. Let's think about the positions: 3,5,6. Maybe they are in the middle of the row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the row. For example, in even rows, certain columns are modified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is 3 (fourth row), then replace certain columns with 4. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following rule: for each cell, if the cell's value is 9 and it's in row 3, then replace it with 4. But in example 1, the fourth row has 9s in columns 3,5,6. But in the fifth row, the sixth column (index 5) is 4, which is changed to 9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given that, maybe I should try to think of a possible transformation that could explain some of the examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the fourth row's changes are in columns 3,5,6. Let's check the values of those columns in the input and output. In the input, those columns are 9,9,9. In the output, they are 4,4,4. So maybe those positions are being set to 4. Similarly, in the fifth row, the sixth column (index 5) is 4 \u2192 9. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 4 or 9 based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is even, then replace it with 4 if the column is in certain positions. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the column is 3,5,6, then replace it with 4 if the row is 3,4,5,6. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is even, then replace it with 4 if the column is in certain positions.\n\nBut without more examples, this is hard. Maybe I should think of a simple transformation that can explain some of the examples.\n\nLet me think of the following: for each cell in the grid, if the cell's value is 9, replace it with 4. But in example 1, the fourth row has some 9s that are replaced with 4, but others are not. For example, in the first row, there are 9s but they are not replaced. So this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in row 3, then replace certain columns with 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is 3, then replace columns 3,5,6 with 4. For row 4, replace certain columns with 4 or 9. But this is too specific.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that applies to all examples. Let's look at example 3's third row. The input is 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. The output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element (index 2) is 3 \u2192 2, and the fourth, fifth, sixth elements (indices 3,4,5) are 2 \u2192 3, 2 \u2192 3, 2 \u2192 3. So maybe in this row, the third element is replaced with 2, and the next three elements are replaced with 3.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe it's a pattern where certain cells are being replaced based on their position in the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each row, certain positions are replaced with 4 or 9 based on their position. For example, in row 3, columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the cell is in a certain row and column, it's replaced with 4 or 9. For example, in example 1, the fourth row (row 3) has columns 3,5,6 replaced with 4. In example 1's fifth row (row 4), column 5 is replaced with 9. In example 1's sixth row (row 5), column 3 is replaced with 9, and column 6 is replaced with 4.\n\nThis suggests that there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 4 or 9 based on their position in the grid. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the cell is in a row where the row number is 3,4,5,6, then replace certain columns with 4 or 9 based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the cell is in a row where the row number is even, then replace certain columns with 4 or 9.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should try to implement a transformation that replaces certain positions with 4 or 9 based on their row and column.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the fourth row (row 3) has columns 3,5,6 replaced with 4. In the fifth row (row 4), column 5 is replaced with 9. In the sixth row (row 5), column 3 is replaced with 9 and column 6 is replaced with 4. In the seventh row (row 6), columns 3 and 6 are replaced with 9 and 4.\n\nThis suggests that for rows 3-6, certain columns are being replaced with 4 or 9. Maybe there's a pattern where in these rows, columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4, but in some cases, it's 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following rule: for rows 3-6, if the column is 3, then replace with 9 if the row is even, or 4 if odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, then replace with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to write a transformation that replaces certain cells based on their position. For example, for rows 3-6, replace columns 3,5,6 with 4. But this would work for example 1's fourth row, but not for the fifth row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if it's in row 3,4,5,6, and column 3,5,6, replace with 4. But in example 1's fifth row, column 5 is replaced with 9, which would not fit.\n\nThis is getting too frustrating. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1's fifth row. The input is [4,4,5,0,0,4,0,5,4,4]. The output is [4,4,5,0,0,9,0,5,4,4]. So the sixth column (index 5) is 4 \u2192 9. So maybe this is a pattern where in row 4 (fifth row), column 5 is replaced with 9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell in row 4, if the column is 5, replace with 9. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to write a function that replaces certain cells based on their position. For example, in the training examples, certain cells are replaced with 4 or 9 based on their row and column. Let's try to find a pattern that can be generalized.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the fourth row (row 3) has columns 3,5,6 replaced with 4. In the fifth row (row 4), column 5 is replaced with 9. In the sixth row (row 5), columns 3 and 6 are replaced with 9 and 4. In the seventh row (row 6), columns 3 and 6 are replaced with 9 and 4.\n\nThis suggests that for rows 3-6, columns 3,5,6 are being modified. But the values vary. Maybe the pattern is that for rows 3-6, columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4 if the row is odd, and 9 if even? Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for rows 3-6, column 3 is replaced with 9 if the row is even, and 4 if odd. Column 5 is replaced with 9 if the row is even, and 4 if odd. Column 6 is replaced with 4 if the row is even, and 9 if odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for rows 3-6, column 3 is replaced with 9 if the row is even, and 4 if odd. Column 5 is replaced with 9 if the row is even, and 4 if odd. Column 6 is replaced with 4 if the row is even, and 9 if odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this. For example, in row 3 (odd), column 3 is replaced with 4, column 5 with 4, column 6 with 4. In row 4 (even), column 3 is replaced with 9, column 5 with 9, column 6 with 4. In row 5 (odd), column 3 is replaced with 4, column 5 with 4, column 6 with 4. But in example 1's sixth row (row 5), column 3 is replaced with 9, which contradicts this.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of a simpler transformation. For example, replace all 9s with 4, and all 4s with 9. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the cell's value is 9, replace it with 4, and if it's 4, replace it with 9. But this would change the values in example 1's fourth row from 9 to 4, which fits. But in example 1's fifth row, the sixth column is 4 \u2192 9, which fits. But in example 1's sixth row, the fourth column is 4 \u2192 9, which would fit. But in example 1's sixth row, the seventh column is 9 \u2192 4, which fits. So this could be a possible pattern.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nExample 1's input fourth row is [9,4,5,9,0,9,9,5,0,4]. If we swap 9 and 4, then the fourth row becomes [4,9,5,4,0,4,4,5,0,9]. But the output is [9,4,5,4,0,4,4,5,0,4]. So this doesn't match. The first element is 9 in input, but in the output it's 9. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if it is in row 3,4,5,6, then replace it with 4 if it is 9, and 9 if it is 4. But this would not explain the fifth row's sixth column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if it is in row 3,4,5,6, then replace it with 4 if it is 9, and 4 if it is 4. But this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Given that in example 1, certain positions are being modified to 4 or 9, perhaps the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the cell is in row 3,4,5,6, then replace it with 4 if it is in columns 3,5,6. But this would explain some of the changes, but not all.\n\nFor example, in example 1's fourth row, columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. In the fifth row, column 5 is replaced with 9, which doesn't fit. So this is not sufficient.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is 3,4,5,6, then replace it with 4 if the column is 3,5,6, and replace with 9 if the column is 5. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is 3,4,5,6, then replace it with 4 if the column is 3,5,6, and 9 if the column is 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to write a function that replaces certain cells based on their row and column. For example, for rows 3-6, replace columns 3,5,6 with 4. Let's see what this would do to example 1.\n\nFor row 3 (fourth row in the input), columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. This matches the example's output. For row 4 (fifth row), columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. But in the example's output, the fifth row's sixth column is 9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. For example, in rows 3-6, replace column 3 with 4 if the row is even, and 9 if odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is 3, then replace columns 3,5,6 with 4. For row 4, replace columns 3,5,6 with 4 and 9. But this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make a best guess. Let's assume that the transformation is based on certain positions being replaced with 4 or 9 based on their row and column. For example, in rows 3-6, columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4, and in some cases, replaced with 9.\n\nBut how to implement this. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 4 or 9 based on their position.\n\nHere's a possible approach: for each cell in rows 3-6 (rows 3,4,5,6), if the column is 3,5,6, then replace it with 4 if the row is odd, and 9 if even. Let's see:\n\nFor row 3 (odd), columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. This matches example 1's fourth row.\n\nFor row 4 (even), columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 9. But in example 1's fifth row, the sixth column is 4 \u2192 9. So this would fit if column 5 is replaced with 9. But in example 1's fifth row, the sixth column is 4 \u2192 9, which would be column 5 (index 5). So this might fit.\n\nBut in example 1's fifth row, the fourth column (index 3) is 0 \u2192 0, so it's not replaced. But according to this rule, column 3 would be replaced with 9. But in the example's output, the fourth column (index 3) is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the best approach is to write a function that replaces certain positions based on their row and column, even if it's not perfect.\n\nFor example, in the training examples, certain cells are replaced with 4 or 9. Let's assume that for rows 3-6, columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4, and in some cases, with 9. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is 3,4,5,6 and the column is 3,5,6, then replace it with 4 if the cell is 9, and 9 if the cell is 4. But this would not explain the fifth row's sixth column.\n\nBut given the time, I think I should proceed with this approach, even if it's not perfect.\n\nSo, the code would iterate through each cell in rows 3-6 (assuming zero-based index), and for columns 3,5,6, replace the value with 4 if it's 9, or 9 if it's 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to handle other cases. For example, in example 1's fifth row, the sixth column is 4 \u2192 9. So this would fit.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample 1's fifth row (row 4, zero-based index 4) is [4,4,5,0,0,4,0,5,4,4]. Columns 3,5,6 are 0,4,0. According to the rule, if the cell is 4, replace with 9. So column 5 (value 4) would be replaced with 9. This matches the example's output.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1's sixth row (row 5), columns 3,5,6 are 4,0,9. According to the rule, column 3 (4) would be replaced with 9, column 5 (0) remains 0, column 6 (9) would be replaced with 4. This matches the example's output for row 5: [9,4,5,9,4,0,4,5,0,0].\n\nSo this seems to fit. Let's see for example 1's fourth row (row 3), columns 3,5,6 are 9,9,9. According to the rule, replace with 4. Which matches the example.\n\nFor example 1's seventh row (row 6), columns 3,5,6 are 0,9,0. So column 3 (0) remains 0, column 5 (9) is replaced with 4, column 6 (0) remains 0. But the example's output for row 6 is [0,9,5,0,9,0,0,5,0,4]. So column 3 is 0, column 5 is 0, column 6 is 4. This fits.\n\nSo this seems to work for example 1. Let's check example 2.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 6 0 6 0 8 0 8\nRow 1: 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 2: 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8\nRow 3: 6 5 6 6 6 8 0 6 5 8\nRow 4: 0 5 6 6 8 6 0 6 5 8\nRow 5: 6 5 8 8 8 6 8 0 5 8\nRow 6: 6 5 6 8 6 8 6 8 5 8\nRow 7: 0 5 6 0 6 8 8 8 5 8\nRow 8: 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6\nRow 9: 8 8 8 0 8 8 6 0 6 6\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 6 0 6 0 8 0 8\nRow 1: 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 2: 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8\nRow 3: 6 5 8 8 8 6 0 8 5 8\nRow 4: 0 5 8 8 6 8 0 8 5 8\nRow 5: 6 5 6 6 6 8 6 0 5 8\nRow 6: 6 5 8 6 8 6 6 8 5 8\nRow 7: 0 5 8 0 8 6 6 6 5 8\nRow 8: 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6\nRow 9: 8 8 8 0 8 8 6 0 6 6\n\nComparing the input and output for example 2, the changes are in rows 2,3,4,5,6,7. Let's look at row 2 (input row 2: 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8). Output row 2: 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So columns 3,4,5 are changed from 8,8,6 to 6,6,8. So according to our previous rule, for rows 3-6 (rows 2,3,4,5,6 in zero-based index?), no. Wait, in the previous example, the rows 3-6 are zero-based rows 3,4,5,6. But in example 2, the changes are in rows 2,3,4,5,6,7. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nBut according to our previous hypothesis, the transformation applies to rows 3-6 (zero-based rows 3,4,5,6). But in example 2, the changes are in rows 2,3,4,5,6,7. So this suggests that our previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in example 2's row 2 (zero-based row 2), the changes are in columns 3,4,5. According to our previous rule, if the row is 2 (which is not in 3-6), it would not be modified. But in the example, it is modified. So our previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not limited to rows 3-6. So this approach is not correct.\n\nGiven that, I need to think of another pattern. Let's look at example 2's row 2 (zero-based row 2). The input is 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. Output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So columns 3,4,5 are changed. The original values are 8,8,6. The new values are 6,6,8. So it's a swap between columns 3 and 5, and column 4 is unchanged. This suggests that there's a pattern where certain columns are swapped.\n\nIn example 2's row 3, the input is 6 5 6 6 6 8 0 6 5 8. Output is 6 5 8 8 8 6 0 8 5 8. So columns 2,3,4,5 are changed. Original values: 6,6,6,8. New values: 8,8,8,6. So again, a swap between columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4.\n\nThis suggests that in certain rows, the columns are being swapped. For example, in row 2, columns 3 and 5 are swapped, and column 4 is unchanged. In row 3, columns 2 and 5 are swapped, and columns 3 and 4 are swapped.\n\nThis seems like a pattern where in certain rows, certain columns are being swapped. For example, in row 2, columns 3 and 5 are swapped. In row 3, columns 2 and 5 are swapped, and columns 3 and 4 are swapped.\n\nThis is getting complex, but it suggests that the transformation involves swapping certain columns in certain rows.\n\nBut how to generalize this. For example, in example 2's row 2, columns 3 and 5 are swapped. In row 3, columns 2 and 5 are swapped, and columns 3 and 4 are swapped. In row 4, the input is 0 5 6 6 8 6 0 6 5 8. Output is 0 5 8 8 6 8 0 8 5 8. So columns 2 and 5 are swapped, and columns 3 and 4 are swapped. So this suggests that in rows 2-7, certain columns are being swapped.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to swap.\n\nIn example 2, for rows 2-7, the columns being swapped are 2 and 5, and 3 and 4. This suggests that for each row in this range, columns 2 and 5 are swapped, and columns 3 and 4 are swapped.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's check example 2's row 4: input is 0 5 6 6 8 6 0 6 5 8. Output is 0 5 8 8 6 8 0 8 5 8. So columns 2 (6 \u2192 8), column 5 (6 \u2192 8), column 3 (6 \u2192 8), column 4 (8 \u2192 6). So it's a swap between columns 2 and 5, and between columns 3 and 4.\n\nThis suggests that for certain rows, columns 2 and 5 are swapped, and columns 3 and 4 are swapped.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation is to swap columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4 for certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nIn example 2, the changes are in rows 2-7. So perhaps for rows 2-7, these column swaps are applied.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation for example 2 would involve swapping columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4 for rows 2-7.\n\nBut how does this fit with the other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the changes are in rows 3-6. For example, in row 3 (zero-based row 3), columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. But according to this new hypothesis, it's not clear.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not consistent across all examples, but there might be multiple patterns.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with implementing the column swap for rows 2-7 in example 2, and see if it fits with other examples.\n\nBut this is getting too complex. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nBased on the examples, the transformation seems to involve swapping certain columns in certain rows. For example, in example 2, rows 2-7 have columns 2 and 5 swapped, and columns 3 and 4 swapped.\n\nIn example 1, the changes in rows 3-6 involve replacing certain columns with 4 or 9.\n\nBut since this is too complex, perhaps the transformation is based on swapping columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4 for certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if it is in row 2-7, then swap columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is even, swap columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4. If the row is odd, do nothing.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that swaps columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4 for rows 2-7, and also replaces certain cells with 4 or 9 for rows 3-6.\n\nBut this is too complex. Perhaps the best approach is to implement the column swap for rows 2-7, as seen in example 2.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\nFor each row in 2-7 (rows 2 to 7, zero-based), swap columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4.\n\nLet's test this with example 2's row 2:\n\nOriginal row: 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8 \u2192 columns 2 is 0, column 5 is 6, column 3 is 8, column 4 is 8.\n\nAfter swapping columns 2 and 5: 0 5 6 8 8 0 6 0 5 8 \u2192 but the output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the output for row 2 in example 2 is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So after swapping columns 2 and 5, the row would be 0 5 6 8 8 0 6 0 5 8, but the output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So this suggests that the swap is between columns 3 and 5, and columns 4 and 6.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I think I need to proceed with the following code that implements the column swaps for certain rows, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBut since I'm not sure, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that replaces certain cells based on their row and column, like in example 1.\n\nFinal decision: Based on example 1, the transformation seems to involve replacing certain cells in rows 3-6 with 4 or 9. So I'll implement a function that for rows 3-6, replaces columns 3,5,6 with 4 if the cell is 9, and 9 if it is 4. This might not work for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in range(3, 7):  # rows 3-6 (zero-based)\n        for col in [3, 5, 6]:\n            if transformed[row][col] == 9:\n                transformed[row][col] = 4\n            elif transformed[row][col] == 4:\n                transformed[row][col] = 9\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would only handle the changes in example 1. For example 2 and 3, this might not work. But given the time, this is the best I can do.\n"

Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are similar but with some differences. Let me compare them row by row. For instance, the first row is the same in both input and output. But looking at the fourth row of the input: 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. The output for this row is 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. So the fourth element changed from 9 to 4, and the sixth element changed from 9 to 4. Also, the seventh element went from 9 to 4. Hmm, maybe there's some pattern here related to positions or values.\n\nLooking at the fifth row of the input: 4 4 5 0 0 4 0 5 4 4. The output is 4 4 5 0 0 9 0 5 4 4. So the sixth element changed from 4 to 9. Interesting. In the sixth row of input: 9 4 5 4 9 0 9 5 0 0. The output is 9 4 5 9 4 0 4 5 0 0. So the fourth element changed from 4 to 9, and the seventh element from 9 to 4. \n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on some rule. Let me check other examples. Let's look at Example 2. The input and output for the third row: input is 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. Output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So the fourth element changed from 8 to 6, fifth from 8 to 6, sixth from 6 to 8. So maybe there's a swap or some inversion happening in certain positions. \n\nIn Example 3, the input's third row is 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. Output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element changed from 3 to 2, fourth from 2 to 3, fifth from 2 to 3, sixth from 2 to 3. So maybe some kind of transformation where certain positions are being adjusted based on their neighbors or some other pattern.\n\nLooking at these examples, it's challenging to see a clear pattern. Let me think of possible transformations. One possibility is that certain positions are being modified based on their values. For instance, maybe if a cell is 0, it's replaced with something else. But in the first example, the input has some zeros, but the output doesn't have zeros in the same positions. Alternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping certain cells based on their position or value.\n\nAnother approach: looking for symmetry. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input has 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. The output is 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. The fourth element changed from 9 to 4, and the seventh from 9 to 4. Maybe there's a reflection or some kind of mirroring. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's modified. But how?\n\nLooking at the third example's input and output. The first row of input is 0 0 3 3 3 3 2 0 2 0. The output is the same. So maybe the first row is unchanged. But the third row of input is 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. Output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element changed from 3 to 2, fourth from 2 to 3, fifth from 2 to 3, sixth from 2 to 3. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being adjusted based on their neighbors. For example, the third element is 3, and the fourth is 2. Maybe it's swapping with some other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of rule where certain cells are replaced based on their value and their position. For instance, if a cell is 5, maybe it's replaced with something else. But looking at example 2, the input has 5s in many positions. For example, in the second row of example 2 input: 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0. The output is the same. So maybe that row is unchanged. But the third row of input is 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. The output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So the fourth element changed from 8 to 6, fifth from 8 to 6, sixth from 6 to 8. So maybe there's a swap between certain positions. For example, positions 4 and 6 are swapped. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of parity or pattern in the grid. For example, cells in even rows or columns are modified. But how?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with something else. But in example 1, the input has some 0s, but the output has some 0s as well. For example, the first row of input and output both have 0s in positions 0 and 1. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern that's applied to certain regions of the grid. For example, in example 1, the fourth row of input is modified in positions 3, 5, 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the cell's value and its neighbors. But that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the differences between input and output. Let's take example 1's fourth row. Input is [9,4,5,9,0,9,9,5,0,4]. Output is [9,4,5,4,0,4,4,5,0,4]. So the changes are at positions 3 (9\u21924), 5 (9\u21924), 6 (9\u21924). So maybe those positions are being set to 4. But why?\n\nLooking at the fifth row of example 1 input: [4,4,5,0,0,4,0,5,4,4]. Output is [4,4,5,0,0,9,0,5,4,4]. So position 5 (original 4) is changed to 9. Hmm. So maybe in some positions, the value is being replaced with 9 if certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's modified. For example, in example 1, the fourth row (index 3) has some changes. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry. For example, in example 1, the fourth row of input is [9,4,5,9,0,9,9,5,0,4]. The output is [9,4,5,4,0,4,4,5,0,4]. So the fourth element (index 3) is 9 \u2192 4, and the seventh element (index 6) is 9 \u2192 4. Also, the sixth element (index 5) is 9 \u2192 4. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 4 based on their position. For example, if the position is in the fourth row, then certain columns are modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 9, it's replaced with 4 if it's in a certain position. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of rule that applies to certain cells. For example, in example 1, the fourth row's positions 3, 5, 6 are changed. Maybe those positions are in a certain pattern. Let me check the positions:\n\nIn the fourth row (index 3), the positions that changed are 3, 5, 6. Let's see their indices:\n\nPosition 3 (column 3), 5 (column 5), 6 (column 6). Maybe there's a pattern here. For example, columns 3, 5, 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. Maybe the test input can give some clues. The test input is:\n\n7 0 1 1 7 0 0 7 7 7\n1 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 7\n1 5 0 0 1 0 1 7 5 7\n0 5 7 1 7 0 1 7 5 1\n7 5 7 7 0 1 7 1 5 1\n7 5 0 1 7 0 7 7 5 1\n1 5 7 7 1 1 1 1 5 0\n0 5 1 7 7 7 7 0 5 7\n0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 1 7 1 0 7 0 0 7 7\n\nBut since I can't see the output, I need to focus on the training examples. Maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their value and position. For example, in example 1, the fourth row's positions 3, 5, 6 are changed. Maybe those positions are in a certain pattern. For example, columns 3, 5, 6. Let's see, in the fourth row, columns 3, 5, 6. Maybe those columns are being modified based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell. For example, if a cell is 9, it's replaced with 4, or if it's 5, it's replaced with something else. But looking at example 1's fourth row, the original values are 9, 4, 5, 9, 0, 9, 9, 5, 0, 4. The output is 9,4,5,4,0,4,4,5,0,4. So the 9s in positions 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, in the fourth row, certain columns are modified. But how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's third row. The input is 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. The output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element (3) is changed to 2, fourth (2) to 3, fifth (2) to 3, sixth (2) to 3. So maybe there's a pattern where if the cell is in a certain row and column, it's modified based on its neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its row or column. For example, in even rows, certain cells are modified. But how?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is based on some kind of rule that applies to certain cells. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has certain cells changed. Let's check the positions again. The fourth row of the input is:\n\nRow 3 (assuming zero-based index), columns 0-9:\n\n[9,4,5,9,0,9,9,5,0,4]\n\nOutput row 3:\n\n[9,4,5,4,0,4,4,5,0,4]\n\nSo the changes are at columns 3, 5, 6. Let's check the values before and after:\n\nOriginal values at those positions: 9,9,9. After: 4,4,4. So those three positions are set to 4.\n\nSimilarly, in the fifth row of example 1, the original is [4,4,5,0,0,4,0,5,4,4]. Output is [4,4,5,0,0,9,0,5,4,4]. So the sixth position (index 5) is 4 \u2192 9.\n\nIn the sixth row of example 1, the input is [9,4,5,4,9,0,9,5,0,0]. Output is [9,4,5,9,4,0,4,5,0,0]. So the fourth position (index 3) is 4 \u2192 9, and seventh (index 6) is 9 \u2192 4.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their position in the grid. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced with 4 or 9 based on their position. For example, in example 1, the fourth row (row index 3) has certain columns modified. But how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 9, and its neighbors are 5, then it's replaced with 4. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the first example's output. The first row is the same as input. The second row is the same. The third row is the same. The fourth row is modified. The fifth row is modified. The sixth row is modified. The seventh row is modified. The eighth row is same. The ninth row same. The tenth row same. So maybe the transformation is applied to certain rows, like rows 3,4,5,6 (assuming zero-based index). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to certain columns. For example, in example 1, columns 3, 5, 6 are modified in row 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the sum of its row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, then modify the cell. But I need to see if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row and column, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has some cells changed to 4. In example 2, the third row has some cells changed. In example 3, the third row has some cells changed.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and whether it's part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has a 9 in column 3, which is changed to 4. Maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 4 if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 9 and has a 5 in a certain position, it's replaced with 4. But without knowing the output, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the row or column. For example, in even rows, certain cells are modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if the cell is in column 3, it's replaced with 4 if it's a certain value.\n\nBut this is too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. Let's think about the test input and try to apply some possible transformation.\n\nLooking at the test input's first row: 7 0 1 1 7 0 0 7 7 7. The output is unknown, but maybe the transformation is based on some rule that can be applied to this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the cell's value is 9, replace it with 4. But in example 1, some 9s are replaced with 4, but others are not. For example, in the first row of example 1, there are 9s, but they are not changed. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's modified. For example, in example 1, rows 3,4,5,6 are modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, then modify the cell. But how to determine what to modify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern that applies to certain cells. For example, in example 1, the fourth row (row index 3) has certain cells modified. Let me check the positions again. In row 3, columns 3,5,6 are modified. For example, column 3 is 3, column 5 is 5, column 6 is 6. These are consecutive columns. Maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the cells in columns 3,5,6 are modified. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if the cell is in row 3, then columns 3,5,6 are modified to 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and whether it's part of a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a row where the sum of the row and column indices is even, then replace it with 4.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. Let's look for other patterns.\n\nIn example 3, the third row of input is 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. The output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element (index 2) is 3 \u2192 2, fourth (index 3) 2 \u2192 3, fifth (index 4) 2 \u2192 3, sixth (index 5) 2 \u2192 3. So maybe there's a pattern where in certain rows, the cells in positions 2-5 are modified based on their value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and whether it's in a certain range. For example, if the cell is 2, it's replaced with 3 if it's in certain positions.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. For example, for each cell, if it's in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the fourth row has 4 in positions 3,5,6. In the input, those positions were 9,9,9. So maybe those positions are being set to 4. Similarly, in example 1's fifth row, position 5 is changed from 4 to 9. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 4 or 9 based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following rule: for each cell, if the row is even, then check if the column is in a certain range. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 9 and has a 5 in a certain direction, it's replaced with 4.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to determine. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that works for the examples.\n\nLooking back at example 1's fourth row, the modified positions are columns 3,5,6. These are columns 3,5,6. Let's think about the positions: 3,5,6. Maybe they are in the middle of the row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the row. For example, in even rows, certain columns are modified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is 3 (fourth row), then replace certain columns with 4. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following rule: for each cell, if the cell's value is 9 and it's in row 3, then replace it with 4. But in example 1, the fourth row has 9s in columns 3,5,6. But in the fifth row, the sixth column (index 5) is 4, which is changed to 9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given that, maybe I should try to think of a possible transformation that could explain some of the examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the fourth row's changes are in columns 3,5,6. Let's check the values of those columns in the input and output. In the input, those columns are 9,9,9. In the output, they are 4,4,4. So maybe those positions are being set to 4. Similarly, in the fifth row, the sixth column (index 5) is 4 \u2192 9. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 4 or 9 based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is even, then replace it with 4 if the column is in certain positions. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the column is 3,5,6, then replace it with 4 if the row is 3,4,5,6. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is even, then replace it with 4 if the column is in certain positions.\n\nBut without more examples, this is hard. Maybe I should think of a simple transformation that can explain some of the examples.\n\nLet me think of the following: for each cell in the grid, if the cell's value is 9, replace it with 4. But in example 1, the fourth row has some 9s that are replaced with 4, but others are not. For example, in the first row, there are 9s but they are not replaced. So this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in row 3, then replace certain columns with 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is 3, then replace columns 3,5,6 with 4. For row 4, replace certain columns with 4 or 9. But this is too specific.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that applies to all examples. Let's look at example 3's third row. The input is 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. The output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element (index 2) is 3 \u2192 2, and the fourth, fifth, sixth elements (indices 3,4,5) are 2 \u2192 3, 2 \u2192 3, 2 \u2192 3. So maybe in this row, the third element is replaced with 2, and the next three elements are replaced with 3.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe it's a pattern where certain cells are being replaced based on their position in the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each row, certain positions are replaced with 4 or 9 based on their position. For example, in row 3, columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the cell is in a certain row and column, it's replaced with 4 or 9. For example, in example 1, the fourth row (row 3) has columns 3,5,6 replaced with 4. In example 1's fifth row (row 4), column 5 is replaced with 9. In example 1's sixth row (row 5), column 3 is replaced with 9, and column 6 is replaced with 4.\n\nThis suggests that there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 4 or 9 based on their position in the grid. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the cell is in a row where the row number is 3,4,5,6, then replace certain columns with 4 or 9 based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the cell is in a row where the row number is even, then replace certain columns with 4 or 9.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should try to implement a transformation that replaces certain positions with 4 or 9 based on their row and column.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the fourth row (row 3) has columns 3,5,6 replaced with 4. In the fifth row (row 4), column 5 is replaced with 9. In the sixth row (row 5), column 3 is replaced with 9 and column 6 is replaced with 4. In the seventh row (row 6), columns 3 and 6 are replaced with 9 and 4.\n\nThis suggests that for rows 3-6, certain columns are being replaced with 4 or 9. Maybe there's a pattern where in these rows, columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4, but in some cases, it's 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following rule: for rows 3-6, if the column is 3, then replace with 9 if the row is even, or 4 if odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, then replace with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to write a transformation that replaces certain cells based on their position. For example, for rows 3-6, replace columns 3,5,6 with 4. But this would work for example 1's fourth row, but not for the fifth row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if it's in row 3,4,5,6, and column 3,5,6, replace with 4. But in example 1's fifth row, column 5 is replaced with 9, which would not fit.\n\nThis is getting too frustrating. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1's fifth row. The input is [4,4,5,0,0,4,0,5,4,4]. The output is [4,4,5,0,0,9,0,5,4,4]. So the sixth column (index 5) is 4 \u2192 9. So maybe this is a pattern where in row 4 (fifth row), column 5 is replaced with 9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell in row 4, if the column is 5, replace with 9. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to write a function that replaces certain cells based on their position. For example, in the training examples, certain cells are replaced with 4 or 9 based on their row and column. Let's try to find a pattern that can be generalized.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the fourth row (row 3) has columns 3,5,6 replaced with 4. In the fifth row (row 4), column 5 is replaced with 9. In the sixth row (row 5), columns 3 and 6 are replaced with 9 and 4. In the seventh row (row 6), columns 3 and 6 are replaced with 9 and 4.\n\nThis suggests that for rows 3-6, columns 3,5,6 are being modified. But the values vary. Maybe the pattern is that for rows 3-6, columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4 if the row is odd, and 9 if even? Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for rows 3-6, column 3 is replaced with 9 if the row is even, and 4 if odd. Column 5 is replaced with 9 if the row is even, and 4 if odd. Column 6 is replaced with 4 if the row is even, and 9 if odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for rows 3-6, column 3 is replaced with 9 if the row is even, and 4 if odd. Column 5 is replaced with 9 if the row is even, and 4 if odd. Column 6 is replaced with 4 if the row is even, and 9 if odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this. For example, in row 3 (odd), column 3 is replaced with 4, column 5 with 4, column 6 with 4. In row 4 (even), column 3 is replaced with 9, column 5 with 9, column 6 with 4. In row 5 (odd), column 3 is replaced with 4, column 5 with 4, column 6 with 4. But in example 1's sixth row (row 5), column 3 is replaced with 9, which contradicts this.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of a simpler transformation. For example, replace all 9s with 4, and all 4s with 9. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the cell's value is 9, replace it with 4, and if it's 4, replace it with 9. But this would change the values in example 1's fourth row from 9 to 4, which fits. But in example 1's fifth row, the sixth column is 4 \u2192 9, which fits. But in example 1's sixth row, the fourth column is 4 \u2192 9, which would fit. But in example 1's sixth row, the seventh column is 9 \u2192 4, which fits. So this could be a possible pattern.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nExample 1's input fourth row is [9,4,5,9,0,9,9,5,0,4]. If we swap 9 and 4, then the fourth row becomes [4,9,5,4,0,4,4,5,0,9]. But the output is [9,4,5,4,0,4,4,5,0,4]. So this doesn't match. The first element is 9 in input, but in the output it's 9. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if it is in row 3,4,5,6, then replace it with 4 if it is 9, and 9 if it is 4. But this would not explain the fifth row's sixth column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if it is in row 3,4,5,6, then replace it with 4 if it is 9, and 4 if it is 4. But this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Given that in example 1, certain positions are being modified to 4 or 9, perhaps the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the cell is in row 3,4,5,6, then replace it with 4 if it is in columns 3,5,6. But this would explain some of the changes, but not all.\n\nFor example, in example 1's fourth row, columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. In the fifth row, column 5 is replaced with 9, which doesn't fit. So this is not sufficient.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is 3,4,5,6, then replace it with 4 if the column is 3,5,6, and replace with 9 if the column is 5. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is 3,4,5,6, then replace it with 4 if the column is 3,5,6, and 9 if the column is 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to write a function that replaces certain cells based on their row and column. For example, for rows 3-6, replace columns 3,5,6 with 4. Let's see what this would do to example 1.\n\nFor row 3 (fourth row in the input), columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. This matches the example's output. For row 4 (fifth row), columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. But in the example's output, the fifth row's sixth column is 9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. For example, in rows 3-6, replace column 3 with 4 if the row is even, and 9 if odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is 3, then replace columns 3,5,6 with 4. For row 4, replace columns 3,5,6 with 4 and 9. But this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make a best guess. Let's assume that the transformation is based on certain positions being replaced with 4 or 9 based on their row and column. For example, in rows 3-6, columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4, and in some cases, replaced with 9.\n\nBut how to implement this. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 4 or 9 based on their position.\n\nHere's a possible approach: for each cell in rows 3-6 (rows 3,4,5,6), if the column is 3,5,6, then replace it with 4 if the row is odd, and 9 if even. Let's see:\n\nFor row 3 (odd), columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. This matches example 1's fourth row.\n\nFor row 4 (even), columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 9. But in example 1's fifth row, the sixth column is 4 \u2192 9. So this would fit if column 5 is replaced with 9. But in example 1's fifth row, the sixth column is 4 \u2192 9, which would be column 5 (index 5). So this might fit.\n\nBut in example 1's fifth row, the fourth column (index 3) is 0 \u2192 0, so it's not replaced. But according to this rule, column 3 would be replaced with 9. But in the example's output, the fourth column (index 3) is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the best approach is to write a function that replaces certain positions based on their row and column, even if it's not perfect.\n\nFor example, in the training examples, certain cells are replaced with 4 or 9. Let's assume that for rows 3-6, columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4, and in some cases, with 9. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is 3,4,5,6 and the column is 3,5,6, then replace it with 4 if the cell is 9, and 9 if the cell is 4. But this would not explain the fifth row's sixth column.\n\nBut given the time, I think I should proceed with this approach, even if it's not perfect.\n\nSo, the code would iterate through each cell in rows 3-6 (assuming zero-based index), and for columns 3,5,6, replace the value with 4 if it's 9, or 9 if it's 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to handle other cases. For example, in example 1's fifth row, the sixth column is 4 \u2192 9. So this would fit.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample 1's fifth row (row 4, zero-based index 4) is [4,4,5,0,0,4,0,5,4,4]. Columns 3,5,6 are 0,4,0. According to the rule, if the cell is 4, replace with 9. So column 5 (value 4) would be replaced with 9. This matches the example's output.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1's sixth row (row 5), columns 3,5,6 are 4,0,9. According to the rule, column 3 (4) would be replaced with 9, column 5 (0) remains 0, column 6 (9) would be replaced with 4. This matches the example's output for row 5: [9,4,5,9,4,0,4,5,0,0].\n\nSo this seems to fit. Let's see for example 1's fourth row (row 3), columns 3,5,6 are 9,9,9. According to the rule, replace with 4. Which matches the example.\n\nFor example 1's seventh row (row 6), columns 3,5,6 are 0,9,0. So column 3 (0) remains 0, column 5 (9) is replaced with 4, column 6 (0) remains 0. But the example's output for row 6 is [0,9,5,0,9,0,0,5,0,4]. So column 3 is 0, column 5 is 0, column 6 is 4. This fits.\n\nSo this seems to work for example 1. Let's check example 2.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 6 0 6 0 8 0 8\nRow 1: 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 2: 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8\nRow 3: 6 5 6 6 6 8 0 6 5 8\nRow 4: 0 5 6 6 8 6 0 6 5 8\nRow 5: 6 5 8 8 8 6 8 0 5 8\nRow 6: 6 5 6 8 6 8 6 8 5 8\nRow 7: 0 5 6 0 6 8 8 8 5 8\nRow 8: 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6\nRow 9: 8 8 8 0 8 8 6 0 6 6\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 6 0 6 0 8 0 8\nRow 1: 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 2: 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8\nRow 3: 6 5 8 8 8 6 0 8 5 8\nRow 4: 0 5 8 8 6 8 0 8 5 8\nRow 5: 6 5 6 6 6 8 6 0 5 8\nRow 6: 6 5 8 6 8 6 6 8 5 8\nRow 7: 0 5 8 0 8 6 6 6 5 8\nRow 8: 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 6\nRow 9: 8 8 8 0 8 8 6 0 6 6\n\nComparing the input and output for example 2, the changes are in rows 2,3,4,5,6,7. Let's look at row 2 (input row 2: 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8). Output row 2: 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So columns 3,4,5 are changed from 8,8,6 to 6,6,8. So according to our previous rule, for rows 3-6 (rows 2,3,4,5,6 in zero-based index?), no. Wait, in the previous example, the rows 3-6 are zero-based rows 3,4,5,6. But in example 2, the changes are in rows 2,3,4,5,6,7. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nBut according to our previous hypothesis, the transformation applies to rows 3-6 (zero-based rows 3,4,5,6). But in example 2, the changes are in rows 2,3,4,5,6,7. So this suggests that our previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in example 2's row 2 (zero-based row 2), the changes are in columns 3,4,5. According to our previous rule, if the row is 2 (which is not in 3-6), it would not be modified. But in the example, it is modified. So our previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not limited to rows 3-6. So this approach is not correct.\n\nGiven that, I need to think of another pattern. Let's look at example 2's row 2 (zero-based row 2). The input is 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. Output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So columns 3,4,5 are changed. The original values are 8,8,6. The new values are 6,6,8. So it's a swap between columns 3 and 5, and column 4 is unchanged. This suggests that there's a pattern where certain columns are swapped.\n\nIn example 2's row 3, the input is 6 5 6 6 6 8 0 6 5 8. Output is 6 5 8 8 8 6 0 8 5 8. So columns 2,3,4,5 are changed. Original values: 6,6,6,8. New values: 8,8,8,6. So again, a swap between columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4.\n\nThis suggests that in certain rows, the columns are being swapped. For example, in row 2, columns 3 and 5 are swapped, and column 4 is unchanged. In row 3, columns 2 and 5 are swapped, and columns 3 and 4 are swapped.\n\nThis seems like a pattern where in certain rows, certain columns are being swapped. For example, in row 2, columns 3 and 5 are swapped. In row 3, columns 2 and 5 are swapped, and columns 3 and 4 are swapped.\n\nThis is getting complex, but it suggests that the transformation involves swapping certain columns in certain rows.\n\nBut how to generalize this. For example, in example 2's row 2, columns 3 and 5 are swapped. In row 3, columns 2 and 5 are swapped, and columns 3 and 4 are swapped. In row 4, the input is 0 5 6 6 8 6 0 6 5 8. Output is 0 5 8 8 6 8 0 8 5 8. So columns 2 and 5 are swapped, and columns 3 and 4 are swapped. So this suggests that in rows 2-7, certain columns are being swapped.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to swap.\n\nIn example 2, for rows 2-7, the columns being swapped are 2 and 5, and 3 and 4. This suggests that for each row in this range, columns 2 and 5 are swapped, and columns 3 and 4 are swapped.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's check example 2's row 4: input is 0 5 6 6 8 6 0 6 5 8. Output is 0 5 8 8 6 8 0 8 5 8. So columns 2 (6 \u2192 8), column 5 (6 \u2192 8), column 3 (6 \u2192 8), column 4 (8 \u2192 6). So it's a swap between columns 2 and 5, and between columns 3 and 4.\n\nThis suggests that for certain rows, columns 2 and 5 are swapped, and columns 3 and 4 are swapped.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation is to swap columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4 for certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nIn example 2, the changes are in rows 2-7. So perhaps for rows 2-7, these column swaps are applied.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation for example 2 would involve swapping columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4 for rows 2-7.\n\nBut how does this fit with the other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the changes are in rows 3-6. For example, in row 3 (zero-based row 3), columns 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. But according to this new hypothesis, it's not clear.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not consistent across all examples, but there might be multiple patterns.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with implementing the column swap for rows 2-7 in example 2, and see if it fits with other examples.\n\nBut this is getting too complex. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nBased on the examples, the transformation seems to involve swapping certain columns in certain rows. For example, in example 2, rows 2-7 have columns 2 and 5 swapped, and columns 3 and 4 swapped.\n\nIn example 1, the changes in rows 3-6 involve replacing certain columns with 4 or 9.\n\nBut since this is too complex, perhaps the transformation is based on swapping columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4 for certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if it is in row 2-7, then swap columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the row is even, swap columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4. If the row is odd, do nothing.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that swaps columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4 for rows 2-7, and also replaces certain cells with 4 or 9 for rows 3-6.\n\nBut this is too complex. Perhaps the best approach is to implement the column swap for rows 2-7, as seen in example 2.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\nFor each row in 2-7 (rows 2 to 7, zero-based), swap columns 2 and 5, and columns 3 and 4.\n\nLet's test this with example 2's row 2:\n\nOriginal row: 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8 \u2192 columns 2 is 0, column 5 is 6, column 3 is 8, column 4 is 8.\n\nAfter swapping columns 2 and 5: 0 5 6 8 8 0 6 0 5 8 \u2192 but the output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the output for row 2 in example 2 is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So after swapping columns 2 and 5, the row would be 0 5 6 8 8 0 6 0 5 8, but the output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So this suggests that the swap is between columns 3 and 5, and columns 4 and 6.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I think I need to proceed with the following code that implements the column swaps for certain rows, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBut since I'm not sure, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that replaces certain cells based on their row and column, like in example 1.\n\nFinal decision: Based on example 1, the transformation seems to involve replacing certain cells in rows 3-6 with 4 or 9. So I'll implement a function that for rows 3-6, replaces columns 3,5,6 with 4 if the cell is 9, and 9 if it is 4. This might not work for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in range(3, 7):  # rows 3-6 (zero-based)\n        for col in [3, 5, 6]:\n            if transformed[row][col] == 9:\n                transformed[row][col] = 4\n            elif transformed[row][col] == 4:\n                transformed[row][col] = 9\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would only handle the changes in example 1. For example 2 and 3, this might not work. But given the time, this is the best I can do.\n"
