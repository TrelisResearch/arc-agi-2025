The output grid also has a 23x23 structure, but with transformed values\n3. The transformation seems to involve:\n   - Replacing certain numbers with others (e.g., 5 \u2192 1, 8 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 3, etc.)\n   - Creating patterns where certain numbers are replaced with sequences of numbers\n   - Maintaining the overall structure of the grid\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with sequences of numbers and maintaining the overall structure.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation mapping\n    transformation = {\n        0: 0,\n        1: 1,\n        2: 2,\n        3: 3,\n        4: 4,\n        5: 1,\n        6: 0,\n        7: 0,\n        8: 2,\n        9: 0\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the transformation\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(23):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = transformation[grid[i][j]]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation mapping\n    transformation = {\n        0: 0,\n        1: 1,\n        2: 2,\n        3: 3,\n        4: 4,\n        5: 1,\n        6: 0,\n        7: 0,\n        8: 2,\n        9: 0\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the transformation\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(23):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = transformation[grid[i][j]]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid also has a 23x23 structure, but with transformed values\n3. The transformation seems to involve:\n   - Replacing certain numbers with others (e.g., 5 \u2192 1, 8 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 3, etc.)\n   - Creating patterns where certain numbers are replaced with sequences of numbers\n   - Maintaining the overall structure of the grid\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with sequences of numbers and maintaining the overall structure.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation mapping\n    transformation = {\n        0: 0,\n        1: 1,\n        2: 2,\n        3: 3,\n        4: 4,\n        5: 1,\n        6: 0,\n        7: 0,\n        8: 2,\n        9: 0\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the transformation\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(23):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = transformation[grid[i][j]]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation mapping\n    transformation = {\n        0: 0,\n        1: 1,\n        2: 2,\n        3: 3,\n        4: 4,\n        5: 1,\n        6: 0,\n        7: 0,\n        8: 2,\n        9: 0\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the transformation\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(23):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = transformation[grid[i][j]]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
