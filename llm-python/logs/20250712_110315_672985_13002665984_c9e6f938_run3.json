Example 2's right half is a doubled block, which is like reversed plus extended, but reversing alone covers at least the shape and colors on the right.\n\n### Implementation details:\n- Input: 3\u00d73 list of integers\n- Output: 3\u00d76 list of integers\n- For each row, we add the row itself plus its reversed copy (horizontal flip).\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create output grid with 3 rows and 6 columns\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Left half: original row\n        left = row\n        # Right half: horizontal flip (reverse) of row\n        right = row[::-1]\n        # Combine both halves\n        transformed_row = left + right\n        transformed_grid.append(transformed_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
