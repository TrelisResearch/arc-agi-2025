          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has a row of 1s in the fifth row. The output has the same row, so maybe that's a fixed part. Then, looking at the other rows. The output seems to have some changes in the middle rows. For instance, in the first output row, the 0s are replaced with 3s and 0s. Wait, the input's first row is 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0. So the 2s are replaced with 3s. But in the second input row, the 3 is present, and the output has 3s in some positions. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced based on their positions?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has some 8s and 4s in certain positions. The output seems to have those numbers replaced with other numbers. For example, in the third input row, there's 8 in the 9th column and 8 in the 11th. The output has 8 in the 9th column and 4 in the 11th. Hmm, maybe some kind of transformation where numbers are replaced based on their position or surrounding values.\n\nAnother example is Example 3. The input has a row with 5s and 6s. The output seems to have those numbers transformed into different values. For instance, in the input's 10th row (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), there's 0 0 5 6 6 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output has 0 0 6 5 5 6 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5s and 6s are swapped in some way. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers are mirrored or transformed based on their position.\n\nLooking at the test input, there's a row with 0s and some numbers. The output would be transformed based on some pattern. But since I don't have the output for the test, I need to focus on the training examples.\n\nLet me try to find a possible pattern. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are turned into 3s. But in Example 2, some 8s are turned into 4s. Maybe there's a rule that replaces numbers based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry. For example, in Example 3, the 5s and 6s are swapped in certain positions. Maybe the numbers are mirrored or rotated. But how?\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the transformation involves replacing numbers with other numbers based on their position relative to certain lines or patterns. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is unchanged. But other rows have changes. Maybe the transformation is related to the position of the row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their value and their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a different value.\n\nLooking at Example 2 again. The input has 1s in certain positions. The output has those 1s in the same positions. But other numbers like 8 and 4 are transformed. For instance, in the third row of input, there's 8 in column 8 and 8 in column 11. The output has 8 in column 8 and 4 in column 11. Maybe there's a rule that replaces 8s with 4s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is related to the number of surrounding cells. For example, if a cell has a certain number of adjacent cells with a particular value, it's replaced.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are replaced with 3s. In Example 2, 8s are replaced with 4s. In Example 3, 5s and 6s are swapped. Maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 2, it becomes 3; if it's 8, it becomes 4; if it's 5, it becomes 6 and vice versa. But that seems too simplistic. However, looking at the examples, this might be part of the pattern.\n\nBut how do these numbers relate to their positions? For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in positions where they are in the middle of the grid. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their position. For example, numbers in certain rows or columns are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with a value based on its position. For example, in Example 1, the first row's 2s are replaced with 3s. But in the second row, the 3 is present, and the output has 2s. Wait, the second input row is 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 3 2 3 3 0 0 0. So the 2s are replaced with 3s, and the 3 is replaced with 2? That doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced with the next number in a sequence. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a row with 5 and 6. The output has 6 and 5. So maybe there's a pattern where numbers are swapped in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in a certain column, it's replaced with another value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For instance, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a different value. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is unchanged. But other rows have changes. Maybe the transformation is that certain rows or columns are modified.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 0, it's left as is. Otherwise, it's replaced with a value based on some rule. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are replaced with 3s. In Example 2, 8s are replaced with 4s. In Example 3, 5s and 6s are swapped. Maybe this is a pattern where numbers are replaced based on their value and their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that numbers are replaced with their value plus 1, but that doesn't fit all examples. For example, in Example 1, 2 becomes 3. In Example 2, 8 becomes 4. That would not fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row, it's replaced with a certain value. For example, in Example 1, the first row's 2s are replaced with 3s. But the second row's 3 is replaced with 2. That seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced with others based on their position relative to a central line. For example, in Example 3, the 5s and 6s are swapped in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is that numbers are mirrored in certain ways.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the test input, there are rows with 0s and some numbers. The output would be transformed. For example, in the first row of the test input, there are 0s and a 1. The output would have that 1 in the same position. But in other rows, there are numbers like 2, 8, 2, etc. Maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced with other numbers based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are replaced with their value plus 1, but only if they are in certain positions. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell two rows above. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the numbers are replaced with their value multiplied by some factor. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain cells, the value is replaced with another value based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 2s replaced with 3s. In the second row, the 3 is replaced with 2. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers are swapped in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in column 3 and 5. The output has 3s in those positions. So maybe adding 1. But in Example 2, the 8s are replaced with 4s, which is subtracting 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to look for other patterns. Let's look at Example 2 again. The input has a row where 8 is in column 8 and 11. The output has 8 in column 8 and 4 in column 11. Maybe there's a rule that replaces 8 with 4 in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their position relative to a central line. For example, in Example 3, the 5s and 6s are swapped in certain positions. Maybe the numbers are mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the value is replaced with the value of the cell two rows above. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is unchanged. The sixth row is all zeros. So maybe the transformation is that for rows 0-4, the values are replaced based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell in the row above. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 2s are replaced with 3s, and the 3s are replaced with 2s. So maybe there's a pattern where numbers are swapped in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 2s are in the middle of the grid and are replaced with 3s. The 3s are in the second row and are replaced with 2s. This could be a pattern of swapping numbers in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain columns. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the output has the 5s and 6s swapped in certain positions. For instance, the input's 10th row (assuming rows are 0-indexed) has 5 and 6 in positions 2 and 3. The output has 6 and 5. So maybe there's a pattern where numbers are mirrored in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the numbers are replaced with their mirrored values. For example, in Example 3, the 5s and 6s are swapped in certain positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this? It's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is all 1s. The sixth row is zeros. So maybe the transformation is that for rows 0-4, the values are replaced with those from the row above. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 2s in the first row are replaced with 3s. The 3 in the second row is replaced with 2. So maybe it's a pattern of swapping 2 and 3 in certain positions.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a possible transformation that could fit all examples.\n\nLet me think about the test input. The test input has rows with 0s and some numbers. The output would be transformed. For example, in the first row of the test input, there's a 1 in column 8. The output would have that 1 in the same position. But other rows have numbers like 2, 8, 2, etc. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced with others based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in columns 3 and 5, which are replaced with 3s. But in the second row, the 3 is replaced with 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 1, the first row has 3s in columns 3 and 5. The second row has 3s in columns 2, 3, 4, 5. Maybe the pattern is that numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 2s replaced with 3s. The second row has 3s replaced with 2s. This seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain positions, and minus 1 if they are in others. But this is not clear.\n\nPerhaps I should think about the test input. The test input has rows with 0s and some numbers. For example, the first row has a 1 in column 8. The output would have that 1 in the same position. But other rows have numbers like 2, 8, 2, etc. Maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in columns 3 and 5, which are replaced with 3s. But in the second row, the 3 is in column 3, which is replaced with 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should look for patterns in the positions of the numbers.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 3s in the first row, which were 2s in the input. In the second row, the 3 is replaced with 2. Maybe there's a pattern of swapping 2 and 3 in certain positions.\n\nIn Example 2, the 8s are replaced with 4s in certain positions. Maybe there's a pattern where 8 is replaced with 4, and 4 is replaced with 8 in some cases. But that's not clear.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5s and 6s are swapped in certain positions. For example, the input has 5 and 6 in certain positions, and the output has 6 and 5. So maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are swapped based on their position.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain columns, and minus 1 if they are in others. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is unchanged. Other rows are modified. Maybe the transformation is that for rows 0-4, the numbers are replaced with certain values, and for rows 5-11, they are left as is. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 2s replaced with 3s. The second row has 3s replaced with 2s. This could be a pattern of swapping 2 and 3 in certain positions.\n\nBut this is just a guess. How to code this?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 2, replace with 3; if 3, replace with 2; if 8, replace with 4; if 4, replace with 8; if 5, replace with 6; if 6, replace with 5. But this would fit the examples.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample 1: 2 becomes 3, 3 becomes 2. So the first row's 2s become 3s. The second row's 3 becomes 2. The output matches.\n\nExample 2: 8 becomes 4, and 4 becomes 8. But in the example, the output has 4 in the 11th column of the third row. So maybe that's the case.\n\nExample 3: 5 becomes 6, 6 becomes 5. The input has 5 and 6 in certain positions, and the output swaps them.\n\nBut how to determine which numbers to swap. It seems that certain pairs are swapped. For example, 2 and 3, 8 and 4, 5 and 6.\n\nBut how to know which numbers to swap. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their value. For example:\n\n- 2 \u2192 3\n- 3 \u2192 2\n- 8 \u2192 4\n- 4 \u2192 8\n- 5 \u2192 6\n- 6 \u2192 5\n\nBut what about other numbers? Like 0, 1, 7, 9? They might remain the same.\n\nBut let's check the examples. In Example 1, the fifth row is all 1s, and it remains the same. So 1s are not changed. In Example 2, the input has 1s and they remain the same. In Example 3, the fifth row is all 1s and remains the same. So 1s are not changed.\n\nSo the transformation could be that certain numbers are swapped, and others are left as is. For example:\n\nIf the value is 2, replace with 3.\nIf the value is 3, replace with 2.\nIf the value is 8, replace with 4.\nIf the value is 4, replace with 8.\nIf the value is 5, replace with 6.\nIf the value is 6, replace with 5.\nElse, leave as is.\n\nBut how to determine this from the examples. Let's check the examples.\n\nExample 1: The input has 2s and 3s. The output has 3s where 2s were, and 2s where 3s were. So this would fit.\n\nExample 2: The input has 8s and 4s. The output has 8s where they were and 4s where they were. Wait, no. In the third row of Example 2, the input has 8 in column 8 and 8 in column 11. The output has 8 in column 8 and 4 in column 11. So this would suggest that 8 is replaced with 4 in that position. But according to the above rule, 8 would be replaced with 4. But in other positions, like the third row's column 8, it's 8 and remains 8. So that's conflicting. Wait, in the third row of Example 2, the input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 8 0\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 0 8 0 8 0 1 0 4 0 4 0\n\nSo the 8 in column 8 (which is the 9th column if 0-indexed) becomes 4? Or is that the 9th column? Wait, the input is 12 columns. Let me check the example again.\n\nWait, the input for Example 2 is a 12x12 grid. Wait, no, the input for Example 2 is 12 rows, each with 12 columns. Wait, the input for Example 2 is given as:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n...\nSo each row has 12 elements. The output is also 12x12.\n\nIn the third row of input, the 8 is in column 8 (assuming 0-indexed) and 11. The output has 8 in column 8 and 4 in column 11. So according to this, 8 is replaced with 4 in column 11, but not in column 8. So why is that?\n\nThis suggests that the rule is not simply swapping 8 with 4. So my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. How to reconcile this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, in certain columns, 8 is replaced with 4, but in others not. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain column, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nLooking at the third row of Example 2's input and output:\n\nInput: ... 8 0 8 0 ...\n\nOutput: ... 8 0 4 0 ...\n\nSo the 8 in column 8 is kept, but the 8 in column 11 is replaced with 4. So why?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that if the column is even, replace with something, and if it's odd, replace with something else. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced based on their row and column positions. For example, if the row is even, replace certain numbers, if odd, others.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the input has 5 and 6 in certain positions, and the output swaps them. For example, the input's 10th row has 5 and 6 in positions 2 and 3. The output has 6 and 5. This suggests that there's a pattern where certain numbers are swapped based on their position.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for certain cells, the value is replaced with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 2s. The second row has 3s. The third row has 0s. So maybe the first row's 2s are replaced with the value from the second row's column. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is all 1s. The sixth row is zeros. So the fifth row's 1s would be replaced with the sixth row's value (zero), but that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of a different approach.\n\nLooking at the test input, the first row has a 1 in column 8. The output would have that 1 in the same position. But other rows have numbers like 2, 8, 2, etc. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in columns 3 and 5, which are replaced with 3s. So that would fit. But in the second row, the 3 is replaced with 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 2s. The second row has 3s. The third row has 0s. So the first row's 2s are replaced with 3s (from the second row). But the second row's 3 is replaced with 2 (from the first row?), which doesn't fit. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell in the same row but two columns to the left. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 2 in column 3. The cell to the left is 0, so replaced with 0. But the output has 3, so this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really difficult. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has 3s where 2s were, and 2s where 3s were. This suggests that there's a swap between 2 and 3 in certain positions. Similarly, in Example 2, the 8 is replaced with 4 in certain positions. In Example 3, the 5 and 6 are swapped.\n\nBut why would these swaps happen? Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with another value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, if the value is 2 and the cell is in the first row, replace with 3. If the value is 3 and the cell is in the second row, replace with 2. But this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that numbers are replaced based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, if the value is 2 and the cell is in the first row, replace with 3. If the value is 3 and the cell is in the second row, replace with 2. But this is too specific and would not fit all examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should make a hypothesis that certain numbers are replaced with others based on their value, and implement that, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nFor example, replace 2 with 3, 3 with 2, 8 with 4, 4 with 8, 5 with 6, 6 with 5, and leave others as is.\n\nLet's see if this fits the examples.\n\nExample 1: The first row has 2s replaced with 3s. The second row has 3 replaced with 2. This fits. The other rows have 0s, which are left as is. So this works.\n\nExample 2: The third row has 8 replaced with 4 in column 11. But in column 8, it's 8 and remains 8. Why? This would suggest that the rule is not consistent. But maybe in some cases, the 8 is not replaced. Or maybe there's another condition.\n\nBut according to this hypothesis, 8 should be replaced with 4. So why in the third row of Example 2, the 8 in column 8 is left as is? That suggests that the rule is not simply replacing 8 with 4. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 2, the 8 in column 11 is replaced with 4, but the 8 in column 8 is not. Maybe the column number is even or odd.\n\nFor example, in column 8 (even), 8 is left as is. In column 11 (odd), 8 is replaced with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that if the column is even, 8 is replaced with 4, and if odd, not. But this is not clear.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the hypothesis that certain numbers are swapped, and implement that, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 2:\n                new_row.append(3)\n            elif val == 3:\n                new_row.append(2)\n            elif val == 8:\n                new_row.append(4)\n            elif val == 4:\n                new_row.append(8)\n            elif val == 5:\n                new_row.append(6)\n            elif val == 6:\n                new_row.append(5)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit Example 2's third row, where the 8 in column 8 is left as is. But perhaps the examples are not complete or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 2, the 8 in column 8 is in a certain position, and the 8 in column 11 is replaced with 4. Maybe the column number is related to the replacement.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell two rows above. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is all 1s. The sixth row is all zeros. So the fifth row's 1s would be replaced with the sixth row's value (zero), but that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to look for patterns in the examples that are consistent.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2s are replaced with 3s. In Example 2, the 8 is replaced with 4. In Example 3, the 5 and 6 are swapped. So perhaps the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their value, and others are left as is.\n\nBut how to handle the cases where the replacement is not consistent.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 2, replace with 3; if 3, replace with 2; if 8, replace with 4; if 4, replace with 8; if 5, replace with 6; if 6, replace with 5; else, leave as is.\n\nThis would fit the examples where the replacements are done. For example, in Example 2, the third row's 8 in column 8 is replaced with 4, but in the input, it's 8. So according to this code, it would be replaced with 4. But in the output, it's 8. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut in the example, the third row of input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 8 0\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 0 8 0 8 0 1 0 4 0 4 0\n\nSo the 8 in column 8 is replaced with 4? Or is it 8?\n\nWait, the input's third row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 8 0\n\nThe output's third row is:\n\n0 0 8 0 8 0 1 0 4 0 4 0\n\nSo the 8 in column 8 (9th element) is replaced with 4. The 8 in column 11 (12th element) is replaced with 4. So according to the code, both 8s would be replaced with 4. But in the output, the 8 in column 8 is 8? Or is it 4?\n\nWait, the input's third row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 8 0\n\nThe output's third row is:\n\n0 0 8 0 8 0 1 0 4 0 4 0\n\nSo the 8 in column 8 (9th element) is replaced with 4. The 8 in column 11 (12th element) is replaced with 4. So both 8s are replaced with 4. So according to the code, this would be correct. But why is the 8 in column 8 replaced with 4?\n\nBut according to the code, 8 is replaced with 4. So this fits.\n\nWait, but in the input's third row, the 8 is in column 8 (assuming 0-based index, column 8 is the 9th element). The output has 4 in that position. So the code would replace 8 with 4, which is correct. So the code would work for this case.\n\nBut why in the third row of Example 2, the 8 in column 8 is replaced with 4. According to the code, it should be replaced with 4. So this fits.\n\nSo maybe the code is correct.\n\nBut in the example, the third row of input has 8 in column 8 and 11. The output has 4 in both. So the code would replace both 8s with 4s. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this suggests that the code is correct.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5 and 6 are swapped. The code would replace 5 with 6 and 6 with 5, which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to fit all examples.\n\nLet's check Example 2's third row again. The input has 8 in column 8 and 11. The code replaces both with 4, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2s are replaced with 3s, and 3s with 2s, which matches the output.\n\nSo this code would work for the examples.\n\nThus, the transformation is that certain numbers are swapped based on their value. The code replaces 2 with 3, 3 with 2, 8 with 4, 4 with 8, 5 with 6, 6 with 5. Other numbers are left as is.\n\nThus, the Python function would be as described.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has a row of 1s in the fifth row. The output has the same row, so maybe that's a fixed part. Then, looking at the other rows. The output seems to have some changes in the middle rows. For instance, in the first output row, the 0s are replaced with 3s and 0s. Wait, the input's first row is 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0. So the 2s are replaced with 3s. But in the second input row, the 3 is present, and the output has 3s in some positions. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced based on their positions?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has some 8s and 4s in certain positions. The output seems to have those numbers replaced with other numbers. For example, in the third input row, there's 8 in the 9th column and 8 in the 11th. The output has 8 in the 9th column and 4 in the 11th. Hmm, maybe some kind of transformation where numbers are replaced based on their position or surrounding values.\n\nAnother example is Example 3. The input has a row with 5s and 6s. The output seems to have those numbers transformed into different values. For instance, in the input's 10th row (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), there's 0 0 5 6 6 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output has 0 0 6 5 5 6 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5s and 6s are swapped in some way. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers are mirrored or transformed based on their position.\n\nLooking at the test input, there's a row with 0s and some numbers. The output would be transformed based on some pattern. But since I don't have the output for the test, I need to focus on the training examples.\n\nLet me try to find a possible pattern. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are turned into 3s. But in Example 2, some 8s are turned into 4s. Maybe there's a rule that replaces numbers based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry. For example, in Example 3, the 5s and 6s are swapped in certain positions. Maybe the numbers are mirrored or rotated. But how?\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the transformation involves replacing numbers with other numbers based on their position relative to certain lines or patterns. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is unchanged. But other rows have changes. Maybe the transformation is related to the position of the row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their value and their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a different value.\n\nLooking at Example 2 again. The input has 1s in certain positions. The output has those 1s in the same positions. But other numbers like 8 and 4 are transformed. For instance, in the third row of input, there's 8 in column 8 and 8 in column 11. The output has 8 in column 8 and 4 in column 11. Maybe there's a rule that replaces 8s with 4s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is related to the number of surrounding cells. For example, if a cell has a certain number of adjacent cells with a particular value, it's replaced.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are replaced with 3s. In Example 2, 8s are replaced with 4s. In Example 3, 5s and 6s are swapped. Maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 2, it becomes 3; if it's 8, it becomes 4; if it's 5, it becomes 6 and vice versa. But that seems too simplistic. However, looking at the examples, this might be part of the pattern.\n\nBut how do these numbers relate to their positions? For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in positions where they are in the middle of the grid. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their position. For example, numbers in certain rows or columns are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with a value based on its position. For example, in Example 1, the first row's 2s are replaced with 3s. But in the second row, the 3 is present, and the output has 2s. Wait, the second input row is 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 3 2 3 3 0 0 0. So the 2s are replaced with 3s, and the 3 is replaced with 2? That doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced with the next number in a sequence. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a row with 5 and 6. The output has 6 and 5. So maybe there's a pattern where numbers are swapped in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in a certain column, it's replaced with another value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For instance, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a different value. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is unchanged. But other rows have changes. Maybe the transformation is that certain rows or columns are modified.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 0, it's left as is. Otherwise, it's replaced with a value based on some rule. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are replaced with 3s. In Example 2, 8s are replaced with 4s. In Example 3, 5s and 6s are swapped. Maybe this is a pattern where numbers are replaced based on their value and their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that numbers are replaced with their value plus 1, but that doesn't fit all examples. For example, in Example 1, 2 becomes 3. In Example 2, 8 becomes 4. That would not fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row, it's replaced with a certain value. For example, in Example 1, the first row's 2s are replaced with 3s. But the second row's 3 is replaced with 2. That seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced with others based on their position relative to a central line. For example, in Example 3, the 5s and 6s are swapped in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is that numbers are mirrored in certain ways.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the test input, there are rows with 0s and some numbers. The output would be transformed. For example, in the first row of the test input, there are 0s and a 1. The output would have that 1 in the same position. But in other rows, there are numbers like 2, 8, 2, etc. Maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced with other numbers based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are replaced with their value plus 1, but only if they are in certain positions. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell two rows above. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the numbers are replaced with their value multiplied by some factor. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain cells, the value is replaced with another value based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 2s replaced with 3s. In the second row, the 3 is replaced with 2. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers are swapped in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in column 3 and 5. The output has 3s in those positions. So maybe adding 1. But in Example 2, the 8s are replaced with 4s, which is subtracting 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to look for other patterns. Let's look at Example 2 again. The input has a row where 8 is in column 8 and 11. The output has 8 in column 8 and 4 in column 11. Maybe there's a rule that replaces 8 with 4 in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their position relative to a central line. For example, in Example 3, the 5s and 6s are swapped in certain positions. Maybe the numbers are mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the value is replaced with the value of the cell two rows above. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is unchanged. The sixth row is all zeros. So maybe the transformation is that for rows 0-4, the values are replaced based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell in the row above. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 2s are replaced with 3s, and the 3s are replaced with 2s. So maybe there's a pattern where numbers are swapped in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 2s are in the middle of the grid and are replaced with 3s. The 3s are in the second row and are replaced with 2s. This could be a pattern of swapping numbers in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain columns. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the output has the 5s and 6s swapped in certain positions. For instance, the input's 10th row (assuming rows are 0-indexed) has 5 and 6 in positions 2 and 3. The output has 6 and 5. So maybe there's a pattern where numbers are mirrored in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the numbers are replaced with their mirrored values. For example, in Example 3, the 5s and 6s are swapped in certain positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this? It's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is all 1s. The sixth row is zeros. So maybe the transformation is that for rows 0-4, the values are replaced with those from the row above. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 2s in the first row are replaced with 3s. The 3 in the second row is replaced with 2. So maybe it's a pattern of swapping 2 and 3 in certain positions.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a possible transformation that could fit all examples.\n\nLet me think about the test input. The test input has rows with 0s and some numbers. The output would be transformed. For example, in the first row of the test input, there's a 1 in column 8. The output would have that 1 in the same position. But other rows have numbers like 2, 8, 2, etc. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced with others based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in columns 3 and 5, which are replaced with 3s. But in the second row, the 3 is replaced with 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 1, the first row has 3s in columns 3 and 5. The second row has 3s in columns 2, 3, 4, 5. Maybe the pattern is that numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 2s replaced with 3s. The second row has 3s replaced with 2s. This seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain positions, and minus 1 if they are in others. But this is not clear.\n\nPerhaps I should think about the test input. The test input has rows with 0s and some numbers. For example, the first row has a 1 in column 8. The output would have that 1 in the same position. But other rows have numbers like 2, 8, 2, etc. Maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in columns 3 and 5, which are replaced with 3s. But in the second row, the 3 is in column 3, which is replaced with 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should look for patterns in the positions of the numbers.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 3s in the first row, which were 2s in the input. In the second row, the 3 is replaced with 2. Maybe there's a pattern of swapping 2 and 3 in certain positions.\n\nIn Example 2, the 8s are replaced with 4s in certain positions. Maybe there's a pattern where 8 is replaced with 4, and 4 is replaced with 8 in some cases. But that's not clear.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5s and 6s are swapped in certain positions. For example, the input has 5 and 6 in certain positions, and the output has 6 and 5. So maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are swapped based on their position.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain columns, and minus 1 if they are in others. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is unchanged. Other rows are modified. Maybe the transformation is that for rows 0-4, the numbers are replaced with certain values, and for rows 5-11, they are left as is. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 2s replaced with 3s. The second row has 3s replaced with 2s. This could be a pattern of swapping 2 and 3 in certain positions.\n\nBut this is just a guess. How to code this?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 2, replace with 3; if 3, replace with 2; if 8, replace with 4; if 4, replace with 8; if 5, replace with 6; if 6, replace with 5. But this would fit the examples.\n\nLet's check:\n\nExample 1: 2 becomes 3, 3 becomes 2. So the first row's 2s become 3s. The second row's 3 becomes 2. The output matches.\n\nExample 2: 8 becomes 4, and 4 becomes 8. But in the example, the output has 4 in the 11th column of the third row. So maybe that's the case.\n\nExample 3: 5 becomes 6, 6 becomes 5. The input has 5 and 6 in certain positions, and the output swaps them.\n\nBut how to determine which numbers to swap. It seems that certain pairs are swapped. For example, 2 and 3, 8 and 4, 5 and 6.\n\nBut how to know which numbers to swap. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their value. For example:\n\n- 2 \u2192 3\n- 3 \u2192 2\n- 8 \u2192 4\n- 4 \u2192 8\n- 5 \u2192 6\n- 6 \u2192 5\n\nBut what about other numbers? Like 0, 1, 7, 9? They might remain the same.\n\nBut let's check the examples. In Example 1, the fifth row is all 1s, and it remains the same. So 1s are not changed. In Example 2, the input has 1s and they remain the same. In Example 3, the fifth row is all 1s and remains the same. So 1s are not changed.\n\nSo the transformation could be that certain numbers are swapped, and others are left as is. For example:\n\nIf the value is 2, replace with 3.\nIf the value is 3, replace with 2.\nIf the value is 8, replace with 4.\nIf the value is 4, replace with 8.\nIf the value is 5, replace with 6.\nIf the value is 6, replace with 5.\nElse, leave as is.\n\nBut how to determine this from the examples. Let's check the examples.\n\nExample 1: The input has 2s and 3s. The output has 3s where 2s were, and 2s where 3s were. So this would fit.\n\nExample 2: The input has 8s and 4s. The output has 8s where they were and 4s where they were. Wait, no. In the third row of Example 2, the input has 8 in column 8 and 8 in column 11. The output has 8 in column 8 and 4 in column 11. So this would suggest that 8 is replaced with 4 in that position. But according to the above rule, 8 would be replaced with 4. But in other positions, like the third row's column 8, it's 8 and remains 8. So that's conflicting. Wait, in the third row of Example 2, the input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 8 0\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 0 8 0 8 0 1 0 4 0 4 0\n\nSo the 8 in column 8 (which is the 9th column if 0-indexed) becomes 4? Or is that the 9th column? Wait, the input is 12 columns. Let me check the example again.\n\nWait, the input for Example 2 is a 12x12 grid. Wait, no, the input for Example 2 is 12 rows, each with 12 columns. Wait, the input for Example 2 is given as:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n...\nSo each row has 12 elements. The output is also 12x12.\n\nIn the third row of input, the 8 is in column 8 (assuming 0-indexed) and 11. The output has 8 in column 8 and 4 in column 11. So according to this, 8 is replaced with 4 in column 11, but not in column 8. So why is that?\n\nThis suggests that the rule is not simply swapping 8 with 4. So my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. How to reconcile this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, in certain columns, 8 is replaced with 4, but in others not. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain column, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nLooking at the third row of Example 2's input and output:\n\nInput: ... 8 0 8 0 ...\n\nOutput: ... 8 0 4 0 ...\n\nSo the 8 in column 8 is kept, but the 8 in column 11 is replaced with 4. So why?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that if the column is even, replace with something, and if it's odd, replace with something else. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced based on their row and column positions. For example, if the row is even, replace certain numbers, if odd, others.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the input has 5 and 6 in certain positions, and the output swaps them. For example, the input's 10th row has 5 and 6 in positions 2 and 3. The output has 6 and 5. This suggests that there's a pattern where certain numbers are swapped based on their position.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for certain cells, the value is replaced with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 2s. The second row has 3s. The third row has 0s. So maybe the first row's 2s are replaced with the value from the second row's column. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is all 1s. The sixth row is zeros. So the fifth row's 1s would be replaced with the sixth row's value (zero), but that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of a different approach.\n\nLooking at the test input, the first row has a 1 in column 8. The output would have that 1 in the same position. But other rows have numbers like 2, 8, 2, etc. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are replaced with their value plus 1 if they are in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in columns 3 and 5, which are replaced with 3s. So that would fit. But in the second row, the 3 is replaced with 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 2s. The second row has 3s. The third row has 0s. So the first row's 2s are replaced with 3s (from the second row). But the second row's 3 is replaced with 2 (from the first row?), which doesn't fit. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell in the same row but two columns to the left. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 2 in column 3. The cell to the left is 0, so replaced with 0. But the output has 3, so this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really difficult. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has 3s where 2s were, and 2s where 3s were. This suggests that there's a swap between 2 and 3 in certain positions. Similarly, in Example 2, the 8 is replaced with 4 in certain positions. In Example 3, the 5 and 6 are swapped.\n\nBut why would these swaps happen? Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with another value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, if the value is 2 and the cell is in the first row, replace with 3. If the value is 3 and the cell is in the second row, replace with 2. But this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that numbers are replaced based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, if the value is 2 and the cell is in the first row, replace with 3. If the value is 3 and the cell is in the second row, replace with 2. But this is too specific and would not fit all examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should make a hypothesis that certain numbers are replaced with others based on their value, and implement that, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nFor example, replace 2 with 3, 3 with 2, 8 with 4, 4 with 8, 5 with 6, 6 with 5, and leave others as is.\n\nLet's see if this fits the examples.\n\nExample 1: The first row has 2s replaced with 3s. The second row has 3 replaced with 2. This fits. The other rows have 0s, which are left as is. So this works.\n\nExample 2: The third row has 8 replaced with 4 in column 11. But in column 8, it's 8 and remains 8. Why? This would suggest that the rule is not consistent. But maybe in some cases, the 8 is not replaced. Or maybe there's another condition.\n\nBut according to this hypothesis, 8 should be replaced with 4. So why in the third row of Example 2, the 8 in column 8 is left as is? That suggests that the rule is not simply replacing 8 with 4. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 2, the 8 in column 11 is replaced with 4, but the 8 in column 8 is not. Maybe the column number is even or odd.\n\nFor example, in column 8 (even), 8 is left as is. In column 11 (odd), 8 is replaced with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that if the column is even, 8 is replaced with 4, and if odd, not. But this is not clear.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the hypothesis that certain numbers are swapped, and implement that, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 2:\n                new_row.append(3)\n            elif val == 3:\n                new_row.append(2)\n            elif val == 8:\n                new_row.append(4)\n            elif val == 4:\n                new_row.append(8)\n            elif val == 5:\n                new_row.append(6)\n            elif val == 6:\n                new_row.append(5)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit Example 2's third row, where the 8 in column 8 is left as is. But perhaps the examples are not complete or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 2, the 8 in column 8 is in a certain position, and the 8 in column 11 is replaced with 4. Maybe the column number is related to the replacement.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is not zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell two rows above. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is all 1s. The sixth row is all zeros. So the fifth row's 1s would be replaced with the sixth row's value (zero), but that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to look for patterns in the examples that are consistent.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2s are replaced with 3s. In Example 2, the 8 is replaced with 4. In Example 3, the 5 and 6 are swapped. So perhaps the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their value, and others are left as is.\n\nBut how to handle the cases where the replacement is not consistent.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 2, replace with 3; if 3, replace with 2; if 8, replace with 4; if 4, replace with 8; if 5, replace with 6; if 6, replace with 5; else, leave as is.\n\nThis would fit the examples where the replacements are done. For example, in Example 2, the third row's 8 in column 8 is replaced with 4, but in the input, it's 8. So according to this code, it would be replaced with 4. But in the output, it's 8. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut in the example, the third row of input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 8 0\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 0 8 0 8 0 1 0 4 0 4 0\n\nSo the 8 in column 8 is replaced with 4? Or is it 8?\n\nWait, the input's third row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 8 0\n\nThe output's third row is:\n\n0 0 8 0 8 0 1 0 4 0 4 0\n\nSo the 8 in column 8 (9th element) is replaced with 4. The 8 in column 11 (12th element) is replaced with 4. So according to the code, both 8s would be replaced with 4. But in the output, the 8 in column 8 is 8? Or is it 4?\n\nWait, the input's third row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 8 0\n\nThe output's third row is:\n\n0 0 8 0 8 0 1 0 4 0 4 0\n\nSo the 8 in column 8 (9th element) is replaced with 4. The 8 in column 11 (12th element) is replaced with 4. So both 8s are replaced with 4. So according to the code, this would be correct. But why is the 8 in column 8 replaced with 4?\n\nBut according to the code, 8 is replaced with 4. So this fits.\n\nWait, but in the input's third row, the 8 is in column 8 (assuming 0-based index, column 8 is the 9th element). The output has 4 in that position. So the code would replace 8 with 4, which is correct. So the code would work for this case.\n\nBut why in the third row of Example 2, the 8 in column 8 is replaced with 4. According to the code, it should be replaced with 4. So this fits.\n\nSo maybe the code is correct.\n\nBut in the example, the third row of input has 8 in column 8 and 11. The output has 4 in both. So the code would replace both 8s with 4s. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this suggests that the code is correct.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5 and 6 are swapped. The code would replace 5 with 6 and 6 with 5, which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to fit all examples.\n\nLet's check Example 2's third row again. The input has 8 in column 8 and 11. The code replaces both with 4, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2s are replaced with 3s, and 3s with 2s, which matches the output.\n\nSo this code would work for the examples.\n\nThus, the transformation is that certain numbers are swapped based on their value. The code replaces 2 with 3, 3 with 2, 8 with 4, 4 with 8, 5 with 6, 6 with 5. Other numbers are left as is.\n\nThus, the Python function would be as described.\n"
