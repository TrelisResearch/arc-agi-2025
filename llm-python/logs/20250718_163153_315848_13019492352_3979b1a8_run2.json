          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output grid seems to be a combination of the input grid and some additional patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to be the input grid expanded with additional rows and columns, and with some values changed.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n1. The output grid is always 10x10\n2. The first 5 rows of the output seem to be a combination of the input rows and some additional patterns\n3. The additional rows (rows 5-9) seem to be filled with patterns that depend on the input\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n1. Expands the input grid to 10x10 by adding 5 rows and 5 columns\n2. The additional rows seem to be filled with patterns that depend on the input\n3. The additional columns seem to be filled with patterns that depend on the input\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid to the first 5 rows and first 5 columns\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill the additional rows (rows 5-9)\n    for i in range(5, 10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if j < 5:\n                # Copy from the input grid\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i - 5][j]\n            else:\n                # Fill with 9s for the first 5 columns\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n    \n    # Fill the additional columns (columns 5-9)\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(5, 10):\n            if i < 5:\n                # Copy from the input grid\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j - 5]\n            else:\n                # Fill with 2s for the first 5 rows\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid to the first 5 rows and first 5 columns\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill the additional rows (rows 5-9)\n    for i in range(5, 10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if j < 5:\n                # Copy from the input grid\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i - 5][j]\n            else:\n                # Fill with 9s for the first 5 columns\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n    \n    # Fill the additional columns (columns 5-9)\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(5, 10):\n            if i < 5:\n                # Copy from the input grid\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j - 5]\n            else:\n                # Fill with 2s for the first 5 rows\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The last 5 rows of the output grid seem to be a pattern that extends from the input grid\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n1. Extends the input grid to 10x10 by adding 5 rows and 5 columns\n2. Applies some transformation to the values in the extended grid\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid to the first 5 rows and first 5 columns\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill the remaining columns (columns 5-9)\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5, 10):\n            # For the first 5 rows, fill with 9 if the original value was 9, otherwise 2\n            if grid[i][j-5] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Fill the remaining rows (rows 5-9)\n    for i in range(5, 10):\n        for j in range(5):\n            # For the first 5 columns, fill with 9 if the original value was 9, otherwise 2\n            if grid[i-5][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Fill the remaining part of the grid (rows 5-9, columns 5-9)\n    for i in range(5, 10):\n        for j in range(5, 10):\n            # For the bottom-right 5x5 grid, fill with 9 if the original value was 9, otherwise 2\n            if grid[i-5][j-5] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid to the first 5 rows and first 5 columns\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill the remaining columns (columns 5-9)\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5, 10):\n            # For the first 5 rows, fill with 9 if the original value was 9, otherwise 2\n            if grid[i][j-5] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Fill the remaining rows (rows 5-9)\n    for i in range(5, 10):\n        for j in range(5):\n            # For the first 5 columns, fill with 9 if the original value was 9, otherwise 2\n            if grid[i-5][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Fill the remaining part of the grid (rows 5-9, columns 5-9)\n    for i in range(5, 10):\n        for j in range(5, 10):\n            # For the bottom-right 5x5 grid, fill with 9 if the original value was 9, otherwise 2\n            if grid[i-5][j-5] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
