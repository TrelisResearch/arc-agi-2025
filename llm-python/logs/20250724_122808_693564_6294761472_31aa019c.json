    "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify the pattern.\n\nLet me examine each example carefully:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input has various numbers scattered\n- Output shows a 3x3 square pattern made of 2's with a 4 in the center at position (7,1) to (9,3)\n\nExample 2:\n- Input has various numbers scattered\n- Output shows a 3x3 square pattern made of 2's with a 6 in the center at position (1,6) to (3,8)\n\nExample 3:\n- Input has various numbers scattered\n- Output shows a 3x3 square pattern made of 2's with a 3 in the center at position (7,5) to (9,7)\n\nLet me look for what triggers this pattern. It seems like the transformation creates a 3x3 square of 2's with a specific number in the center.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- In example 1: There's a '4' at position (6,1), and the output has a '4' at the center of the 3x3 square\n- In example 2: There's a '6' at position (2,7), and the output has a '6' at the center of the 3x3 square\n- In example 3: There's a '3' at position (8,7), and the output has a '3' at the center of the 3x3 square\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Find a specific number in the input grid\n2. Create a 3x3 square of 2's at a specific location\n3. Place that specific number in the center of the square\n\nLet me check what numbers are being used:\n- Example 1: '4' is the center number\n- Example 2: '6' is the center number  \n- Example 3: '3' is the center number\n\nAnd where the squares are positioned:\n- Example 1: Bottom left area\n- Example 2: Top right area\n- Example 3: Bottom right area\n\nIt looks like the position might be related to where the center number is found in the input grid, or possibly to other numbers in the grid.\n\nLet me reconsider - maybe it's about finding specific patterns or numbers and then creating these 3x3 blocks based on them.\n\nActually, looking more systematically:\n- The output is always a 3x3 block of 2's with one different number in the center\n- The position of this block seems to vary\n- The center number seems to be a number that exists in the input\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe the pattern is about finding certain \"trigger\" numbers and then placing the 3x3 pattern accordingly.\n\nLooking at the numbers that become centers:\n- 4, 6, 3 - these are all non-zero digits\n\nLet me check if there's a positional relationship:\n- Example 1: '4' is at (6,1) -> 3x3 block at (6-1,1-1) to (6+1,1+1) = (5,0) to (7,2)? No, the block is at rows 6-8, cols 0-2\n- Example 2: '6' is at (2,7) -> 3x3 block at (2-1,7-1) to (2+1,7+1) = (1,6) to (3,8). Yes, that matches!\n- Example 3: '3' is at (8,7) -> 3x3 block at (8-1,7-1) to (8+1,7+1) = (7,6) to (9,8). Yes, that matches!\n\nSo the pattern is:\n1. Find a specific trigger number in the input\n2. Center a 3x3 square of 2's around that position\n3. Put the trigger number in the center of that square\n\nBut which number is the trigger? Let me check:\n- Example 1: '4' at (6,1)\n- Example 2: '6' at (2,7) \n- Example 3: '3' at (8,7)\n\nIs there something special about these numbers? Let me see if they're the only occurrences or have some other property.\n\nLooking at Example 1 more carefully, the '4' at (6,1) seems to be the trigger.\nExample 2, the '6' at (2,7) seems to be the trigger.\nExample 3, the '3' at (8,7) seems to be the trigger.\n\nBut which number to choose as the trigger? Maybe the first one found in a specific scanning order?\n\nLet me try a hypothesis: Find the first occurrence (in row-major order) of a number that appears only once in the grid, or has some other distinguishing property.\n\nActually, let me recheck if these numbers are special in some way by counting their occurrences:\nExample 1: '4' appears only once\nExample 2: '6' appears only once  \nExample 3: '3' appears only once (in the visible part at least)\n\nThat seems to be it! Find a number that appears exactly once, and use its position to place the 3x3 pattern.\n\nLet me implement this approach:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize 10x10 output grid with zeros\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Count occurrences of each number\n    count = {}\n    positions = {}\n    \n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if val != 0:  # Only count non-zero values\n                if val not in count:\n                    count[val] = 0\n                    positions[val] = []\n                count[val] += 1\n                positions[val].append((i, j))\n    \n    # Find numbers that appear exactly once\n    unique_numbers = [num for num, cnt in count.items() if cnt == 1]\n    \n    # If we have unique numbers, use the first one found in row-major order\n    if unique_numbers:\n        # Find the one with the earliest position in row-major order\n        earliest_pos = None\n        chosen_number = None\n        chosen_position = None\n        \n        for num in unique_numbers:\n            for pos in positions[num]:\n                if earliest_pos is None or pos < earliest_pos:\n                    earliest_pos = pos\n                    chosen_number = num\n                    chosen_position = pos\n        \n        if chosen_position:\n            center_row, center_col = chosen_position\n            \n            # Create 3x3 square centered at this position\n            for i in range(max(0, center_row - 1), min(10, center_row + 2)):\n                for j in range(max(0, center_col - 1), min(10, center_col + 2)):\n                    if i == center_row and j == center_col:\n                        result[i][j] = chosen_number\n                    else:\n                        result[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return result\n```",

Maybe it's looking for specific patterns or shapes in the input.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- All outputs are mostly zeros with a 3x3 square of 2s and a center value\n- The placement seems to be related to where certain conditions are met in the input\n\nLet me check if there are specific numbers that trigger this:\n- Example 1 has \"4\" at (6,1) and the pattern center value is \"4\"\n- Example 2 has \"6\" at (2,7) and the pattern center value is \"6\"  \n- Example 3 has \"3\" at (8,6) and the pattern center value is \"3\"\n\nThis seems to be the pattern! When there's a specific number at a position, it creates a 3x3 pattern with 2s around it and that number in the center.\n\nBut I need to figure out the positioning rule. Let me check coordinates:\n- Example 1: \"4\" at (6,1) \u2192 pattern at (6-1,1-1) to (6+1,1+1) = (5,0) to (7,2)\n- Example 2: \"6\" at (2,7) \u2192 pattern at (2-1,7-1) to (2+1,7+1) = (1,6) to (3,8)  \n- Example 3: \"3\" at (8,6) \u2192 pattern at (8-1,6-1) to (8+1,6+1) = (7,5) to (9,7)\n\nYes! The pattern is centered at the same position as the triggering number.\n\nThe rule seems to be:\n1. Find specific numbers in the grid (4, 6, 3 based on examples)\n2. For each such number found at position (r,c), create a 3x3 pattern centered at (r,c)\n3. The pattern has \"2\" in the border and the triggering number in the center\n\nLet me verify what numbers trigger this:\n- 4, 6, 3 all seem to trigger it\n\nActually, let me recheck the coordinates more carefully by looking at the actual output positions:\n\nExample 1: Pattern is at rows 5-7, cols 0-2. Center is (6,1) which has \"4\" in output center.\nExample 2: Pattern is at rows 1-3, cols 6-8. Center is (2,7) which has \"6\" in output center.  \nExample 3: Pattern is at rows 7-9, cols 5-7. Center is (8,6) which has \"3\" in output center.\n\nSo the pattern is placed exactly where the triggering number is found.\n\nWhat numbers trigger it? 4, 6, 3. Let me see if these numbers appear in specific contexts in the input:\n- Example 1: \"4\" at (6,1) in input\n- Example 2: \"6\" at (2,7) in input  \n- Example 3: \"3\" at (9,7) and (7,8) and (8,6) in input... but only (8,6) triggers it?\n\nWait, let me check Example 3 input more carefully:\nRow 8 (0-indexed): \"0 0 0 0 0 2 3 2 0 0\" - the \"3\" is at column 6\nRow 9 (0-indexed): \"0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0\" - no \"3\" here\n\nSo in Example 3, \"3\" is at (8,6) in input, and pattern is centered at (8,6) in output.\n\nThis confirms the pattern: Find numbers 3, 4, 6 in the input, and for each occurrence, create a 3x3 pattern centered on that position with 2s around the border and the number in the center.\n\nLet me also check if other numbers might trigger it or if it's just these specific ones.\n\nBased on the three examples, I'll implement a solution that:\n1. Creates a 10x10 grid of zeros\n2. Finds occurrences of specific numbers (3, 4, 6 based on examples)\n3. For each occurrence, draws a 3x3 pattern with 2s around border and the number in center\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Define which numbers trigger the pattern\n    trigger_numbers = {3, 4, 6}\n    \n    # Scan through the input grid\n    for r in range(10):\n        for c in range(10):\n            # If we find a trigger number\n            if grid[r][c] in trigger_numbers:\n                # Create a 3x3 pattern centered at (r,c)\n                # Check bounds to ensure the 3x3 pattern fits\n                if r >= 1 and r <= 8 and c >= 1 and c <= 8:\n                    # Draw border of 2s\n                    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                                # Center gets the trigger number\n                                output[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n                            else:\n                                # Border gets 2\n                                output[r + dr][c + dc] = 2\n    \n    return output\n```",

Each output contains a 3x3 square of 2s with a different center value\n2. The center values are 4, 6, and 3 respectively\n3.

Find certain key numbers in the input\n2. Based on what numbers are found and their positions, determine where to place a 3x3 pattern\n3. The pattern has 2s around the border and a center value based on the input numbers\n\nLooking more systematically:\n- The center values are 4, 6, 3 in the outputs\n- These might correspond to specific numbers from inputs: 4->4, 6->6, 3->3\n- So it might be taking the actual value from the input to use as center\n\nActually, let me look at positioning:\n- Example 1: Pattern is positioned based on... maybe the 4 at position (6,1)?\n- Example 2: Pattern near a 6 at (2,7)?\n- Example 3: Pattern near a 3 at (9,8) or (8,6)?\n\nLet me try a different approach - maybe it's finding specific numbers and placing the pattern near them:\n- Find number 4 -> place pattern around that position\n- Find number 6 -> place pattern around that position  \n- Find number 3 -> place pattern around that position\n\nActually, looking at the exact positions:\nExample 1: 4 is at (6,1) -> pattern at rows 5-7, cols 0-2 (around that position)\nExample 2: 6 is at (2,7) -> pattern at rows 1-3, cols 6-8 (around that position)\nExample 3: 3 is at (8,6) -> pattern at rows 7-9, cols 5-7 (around that position)\n\nThis seems to be the pattern! Find specific trigger numbers (3, 4, 6) and place a 3x3 box pattern around their positions.\n\nThe pattern in the box is:\n2 2 2\n2 X 2  where X is the trigger number\n2 2 2\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 grid filled with zeros\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Look for trigger numbers: 3, 4, or 6\n    trigger_numbers = {3, 4, 6}\n    trigger_positions = []\n    \n    # Find positions of trigger numbers\n    for r in range(10):\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] in trigger_numbers:\n                trigger_positions.append((r, c, grid[r][c]))\n    \n    # If we found trigger numbers, place pattern around the first one\n    if trigger_positions:\n        r, c, center_value = trigger_positions[0]\n        \n        # Determine the top-left corner of the 3x3 box\n        # Place it so the trigger position is the center\n        box_r_start = max(0, min(7, r - 1))\n        box_c_start = max(0, min(7, c - 1))\n        \n        # Adjust to ensure the box fits in the grid\n        if box_r_start + 2 > 9:\n            box_r_start = 7\n        if box_c_start + 2 > 9:\n            box_c_start = 7\n            \n        # Place the 3x3 pattern: 2s around border, center_value in center\n        for i in range(3):\n            for j in range(3):\n                if i == 1 and j == 1:  # Center position\n                    result[box_r_start + i][box_c_start + j] = center_value\n                else:  # Border positions\n                    result[box_r_start + i][box_c_start + j] = 2\n    \n    return result\n```",

Each output contains a 3x3 square of 2s with a different center value\n2. The center values are 4, 6, and 3 respectively\n3. These center values seem to correspond to specific numbers in the input:\n   - Example 1: center value 4 corresponds to a 4 in the input\n   - Example 2: center value 6 corresponds to a 6 in the input\n   - Example 3: center value 3 corresponds to a 3 in the input\n\nLet me check if there's a pattern in positioning:\n- The 3x3 square seems to be placed where the special number is located or nearby\n- It might be that we're looking for specific numbers (3, 4, 6) and creating a pattern around them\n\nActually, let me reconsider:\n- Example 1: The 4 in input at (6,1) becomes center of pattern at (7,1) - shifted down by 1\n- Example 2: The 6 in input at (2,7) becomes center of pattern at (2,7) - same position\n- Example 3: The 3 in input at (8,6) becomes center of pattern at (8,7) - shifted right by 1\n\nLet me look for what numbers trigger this:\n- 4 \u2192 creates pattern with 4 in center\n- 6 \u2192 creates pattern with 6 in center  \n- 3 \u2192 creates pattern with 3 in center\n\nSo it seems like when we find numbers 3, 4, or 6 in the input, we create a 3x3 pattern of 2s with that number in the center, positioned near the original number.\n\nLet me refine my hypothesis:\n1. Look for numbers 3, 4, or 6 in the input\n2. For each such number found, create a 3x3 square of 2s with that number in the center\n3. Position the square near the original location\n\nLooking more carefully at positions:\n- Example 1: 4 at (6,1) \u2192 pattern at (6-1,1) to (6+1,1) = (5,1) to (7,1)\n- Example 2: 6 at (2,7) \u2192 pattern at (2-1,7-1) to (2+1,7+1) = (1,6) to (3,8)\n- Example 3: 3 at (8,6) \u2192 pattern at (8-1,6-1) to (8+1,6+1) = (7,5) to (9,7)\n\nActually, let me check the exact coordinates:\nExample 1: 4 at (6,1) \u2192 pattern from (5,0) to (7,2), but output shows it from (6,0) to (8,2)\nExample 2: 6 at (2,7) \u2192 pattern from (1,6) to (3,8) \nExample 3: 3 at (8,6) \u2192 pattern from (7,5) to (9,7)\n\nLet me check the output grids more carefully by indexing from 0:\nExample 1: Pattern is at rows 5-7, cols 0-2 (0-indexed)\nExample 2: Pattern is at rows 1-3, cols 6-8 (0-indexed)  \nExample 3: Pattern is at rows 7-9, cols 5-7 (0-indexed)\n\nSo the pattern is a 3x3 grid where:\n- Border cells = 2\n- Center cell = the trigger number (3, 4, or 6)\n\nThe center of the pattern is positioned at the location of the trigger number.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid filled with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Look for trigger numbers (3, 4, 6) in the input grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] in [3, 4, 6]:\n                # Create a 3x3 pattern around this position\n                center_value = grid[i][j]\n                \n                # Define the 3x3 area boundaries\n                start_row = max(0, i - 1)\n                end_row = min(9, i + 1)\n                start_col = max(0, j - 1)\n                end_col = min(9, j + 1)\n                \n                # Fill the 3x3 area with 2s\n                for r in range(start_row, end_row + 1):\n                    for c in range(start_col, end_col + 1):\n                        output[r][c] = 2\n                \n                # Put the center value in the center\n                output[i][j] = center_value\n    \n    return output\n```",

No, the block is at rows 6-8, cols 0-2\n- Example 2: '6' is at (2,7) -> 3x3 block at (2-1,7-1) to (2+1,7+1) = (1,6) to (3,8). Yes, that matches!\n- Example 3: '3' is at (8,7) -> 3x3 block at (8-1,7-1) to (8+1,7+1) = (7,6) to (9,8). Yes, that matches!\n\nSo the pattern is:\n1. Find a specific trigger number in the input\n2.

Let me see if they're the only occurrences or have some other property.\n\nLooking at Example 1 more carefully, the '4' at (6,1) seems to be the trigger.\nExample 2, the '6' at (2,7) seems to be the trigger.\nExample 3, the '3' at (8,7) seems to be the trigger.\n\nBut which number to choose as the trigger? Maybe the first one found in a specific scanning order?\n\nLet me try a hypothesis: Find the first occurrence (in row-major order) of a number that appears only once in the grid, or has some other distinguishing property.\n\nActually, let me recheck if these numbers are special in some way by counting their occurrences:\nExample 1: '4' appears only once\nExample 2: '6' appears only once  \nExample 3: '3' appears only once (in the visible part at least)\n\nThat seems to be it!
