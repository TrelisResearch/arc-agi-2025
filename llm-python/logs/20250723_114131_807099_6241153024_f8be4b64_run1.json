              "content": " needles to move non-zero values to specific patterns, the output grid appears to have transformed the input in a way that involves spreading patterns of specific values (like 3, 6, 8, 5, 2, 4, etc.) into larger blocks or regions. Observing the output grids for examples 1-3, I see that the transformation spreads certain non-zero values into 2x2 blocks, 3x3 blocks, and other patterns. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 3 at position (2,5), which is transformed into a 3 surrounded by 2s in a 5x5 block. Similarly, 6s and 8s are spread into larger patterns. This suggests that the transformation involves filling in the grid with a specific pattern based on the input values.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                if i % 3 == 0 and j % 3 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                if i % 4 == 0 and j % 4 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                if i % 5 == 0 and j % 5 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
