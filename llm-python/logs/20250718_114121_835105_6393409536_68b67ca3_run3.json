Let's look at the patterns:\n\n1. In Example 1, the output grid has values from the input grid in specific positions:\n   - The top-left value (2) is in the top-left of the output\n   - The value 2 is in the top-middle of the output\n   - The value 1 is in the top-right of the output\n   - The value 2 is in the middle-left of the output\n   - The value 1 is in the middle-middle of the output\n   - The value 3 is in the bottom-left of the output\n\n2.
