          "content": "Looking at the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve propagating values from the center outward, especially in the middle rows.\n2. In Example 1, the value 1 in the middle of the grid spreads outward, and the value 3 appears in the middle of the spread.\n3. In Example 2, the value 4 in the middle spreads outward, and the value 6 appears in the middle of the spread.\n4. In Example 3, the value 1 in the middle spreads outward, and the value 8 appears in the middle of the spread.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Identifying the center of the grid (approximately row 5, column 5 for a 10x10 grid)\n- Propagating values from the center outward, with the value at the center being replaced by a new value (like 3, 6, or 8)\n- The spreading pattern seems to be a diamond shape, with values increasing as they move away from the center\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the center of the grid (for 10x10 grid, it's around row 5, column 5)\n    center_row = 5\n    center_col = 5\n    \n    # Find the value at the center\n    center_value = grid[center_row][center_col]\n    \n    # Create a 10x10 grid to hold the transformed values\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Fill the transformed grid with the original values\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Propagate the center value outward\n    # We'll use a distance matrix to determine how far each cell is from the center\n    distance = [[abs(i - center_row) + abs(j - center_col) for j in range(10)] for i in range(10)]\n    \n    # Find the maximum distance\n    max_distance = max(max(row) for row in distance)\n    \n    # Create a value map based on distance from center\n    value_map = {}\n    for d in range(max_distance + 1):\n        if d == 0:\n            value_map[d] = center_value\n        else:\n            # For distances greater than 0, we'll use a pattern that increases the value\n            # This is a simple pattern that increases the value as we move away from the center\n            value_map[d] = center_value + d\n    \n    # Apply the value map to the transformed grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            d = distance[i][j]\n            transformed[i][j] = value_map[d]\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid\n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the center of the grid (for 10x10 grid, it's around row 5, column 5)\n    center_row = 5\n    center_col = 5\n    \n    # Find the value at the center\n    center_value = grid[center_row][center_col]\n    \n    # Create a 10x10 grid to hold the transformed values\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Fill the transformed grid with the original values\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Propagate the center value outward\n    # We'll use a distance matrix to determine how far each cell is from the center\n    distance = [[abs(i - center_row) + abs(j - center_col) for j in range(10)] for i in range(10)]\n    \n    # Find the maximum distance\n    max_distance = max(max(row) for row in distance)\n    \n    # Create a value map based on distance from center\n    value_map = {}\n    for d in range(max_distance + 1):\n        if d == 0:\n            value_map[d] = center_value\n        else:\n            # For distances greater than 0, we'll use a pattern that increases the value\n            # This is a simple pattern that increases the value as we move away from the center\n            value_map[d] = center_value + d\n    \n    # Apply the value map to the transformed grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            d = distance[i][j]\n            transformed[i][j] = value_map[d]\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid\n    return transformed\n```",

              "content": "Looking at the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve propagating values from the center outward, especially in the middle rows.\n2. In Example 1, the value 1 in the middle of the grid spreads outward, and the value 3 appears in the middle of the spread.\n3. In Example 2, the value 4 in the middle spreads outward, and the value 6 appears in the middle of the spread.\n4. In Example 3, the value 1 in the middle spreads outward, and the value 8 appears in the middle of the spread.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Identifying the center of the grid (approximately row 5, column 5 for a 10x10 grid)\n- Propagating values from the center outward, with the value at the center being replaced by a new value (like 3, 6, or 8)\n- The spreading pattern seems to be a diamond shape, with values increasing as they move away from the center\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the center of the grid (for 10x10 grid, it's around row 5, column 5)\n    center_row = 5\n    center_col = 5\n    \n    # Find the value at the center\n    center_value = grid[center_row][center_col]\n    \n    # Create a 10x10 grid to hold the transformed values\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Fill the transformed grid with the original values\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Propagate the center value outward\n    # We'll use a distance matrix to determine how far each cell is from the center\n    distance = [[abs(i - center_row) + abs(j - center_col) for j in range(10)] for i in range(10)]\n    \n    # Find the maximum distance\n    max_distance = max(max(row) for row in distance)\n    \n    # Create a value map based on distance from center\n    value_map = {}\n    for d in range(max_distance + 1):\n        if d == 0:\n            value_map[d] = center_value\n        else:\n            # For distances greater than 0, we'll use a pattern that increases the value\n            # This is a simple pattern that increases the value as we move away from the center\n            value_map[d] = center_value + d\n    \n    # Apply the value map to the transformed grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            d = distance[i][j]\n            transformed[i][j] = value_map[d]\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid\n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the center of the grid (for 10x10 grid, it's around row 5, column 5)\n    center_row = 5\n    center_col = 5\n    \n    # Find the value at the center\n    center_value = grid[center_row][center_col]\n    \n    # Create a 10x10 grid to hold the transformed values\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Fill the transformed grid with the original values\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Propagate the center value outward\n    # We'll use a distance matrix to determine how far each cell is from the center\n    distance = [[abs(i - center_row) + abs(j - center_col) for j in range(10)] for i in range(10)]\n    \n    # Find the maximum distance\n    max_distance = max(max(row) for row in distance)\n    \n    # Create a value map based on distance from center\n    value_map = {}\n    for d in range(max_distance + 1):\n        if d == 0:\n            value_map[d] = center_value\n        else:\n            # For distances greater than 0, we'll use a pattern that increases the value\n            # This is a simple pattern that increases the value as we move away from the center\n            value_map[d] = center_value + d\n    \n    # Apply the value map to the transformed grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            d = distance[i][j]\n            transformed[i][j] = value_map[d]\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid\n    return transformed\n```",
