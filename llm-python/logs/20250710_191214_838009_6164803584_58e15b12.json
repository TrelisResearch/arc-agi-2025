          "Let's carefully analyze the pattern using the provided images:\n\n**Observations:**\n\n- The input contains vertical green (3) and blue (8) bars, always in pairs for each color.\n- In the output, the bars are \"split\" into diagonal paths, with green and blue cells drawing out zig-zags or diagonals across the entire (23x17) output grid.\n- Wherever the diagonals cross, a magenta/violet cell (6) is placed at the intersection.\n- The grid is always (23x17) in output (vertical stretch).\n- Bars keep their color and get converted into long continuous zig-zag/diagonal lines.\n- Blue and green never change color; blue and green diagonals cross each other.\n- The transformation always produces the same shape pattern for diagonal paths regardless of initial positions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n- For each blue (8) or green (3) pair, find their columns or rows, create diagonals starting from their position, and fill the grid.\n- Whenever the same cell is claimed by both a blue and a green diagonal, set it to 6 (magenta).\n- Output is always 23x17.\n\n**Implementation summary:**\n\n1. Identify all blue and green \"bar\" starting columns.\n2. For each bar, initiate a diagonal line (one going bottom-left to top-right, one going top-left to bottom-right).\n3. For each step, keep the diagonals until the bounds are filled, marking cells in the output.\n4. On overlaps, paint magenta (6).\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The output size is always 23x17\n    out_h, out_w = 23, 17\n    out = np.zeros((out_h, out_w), dtype=int)\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n\n    # Scan for bars: get (col, color) pairs for top pixel of each bar\n    def find_vertical_bars(arr, color):\n        bars = []\n        h, w = arr.shape\n        # Look for vertical pairs\n        for c in range(w):\n            for r in range(h - 1):\n                if arr[r][c] == color and arr[r+1][c] == color:\n                    # ensure not counted twice\n                    if r == 0 or arr[r-1][c] != color:\n                        bars.append((r, c))\n        return bars\n\n    blue_bars = find_vertical_bars(grid, 8)\n    green_bars = find_vertical_bars(grid, 3)\n\n    # Draw diagonal for each bar of a specific color\n    def draw_diag_lines(out, bars, color, direction):\n        for (r, c) in bars:\n            # Each input bar always consists of two pixels vertically\n            # Output: Start the diagonal from top edge (if bar is on upper side), otherwise position so trajectory matches\n            # Figure out the starting diagonal\n            # We interpret direction as either \\ or /\n            # Note in the outputs, bars that are to the left start with their diagonal on the left side,\n            # bars that are to the right start with their diagonal on the right side.\n            if direction == \"left\":\n                # Diagonal goes from top-left to bottom-right, increase both row and col\n                steps = min(out_h, out_w - c)\n                for i in range(steps):\n                    rr = i\n                    cc = c + i\n                    if rr < out_h and cc < out_w:\n                        if out[rr, cc] and out[rr, cc] != color:\n                            out[rr, cc] = 6\n                        else:\n                            out[rr, cc] = color\n            elif direction == \"right\":\n                # Diagonal goes from top-right to bottom-left, increase row, decrease col\n                steps = min(out_h, c + 1)\n                for i in range(steps):\n                    rr = i\n                    cc = c - i\n                    if rr < out_h and cc >= 0:\n                        if out[rr, cc] and out[rr, cc] != color:\n                            out[rr, cc] = 6\n                        else:\n                            out[rr, cc] = color\n\n    if blue_bars and green_bars:\n        # Decide which bar to assign to \"left\" and \"right\"; usually by position on x\n        blue_cols = [col for row, col in blue_bars]\n        green_cols = [col for row, col in green_bars]\n        blue_bars_sorted = sorted(blue_bars, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        green_bars_sorted = sorted(green_bars, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n        # To match the output pattern, assign the leftmost blue bar to left diag, rightmost to right diag\n        # Same for green\n        # For two bars only:\n        if len(blue_bars_sorted) == 2:\n            draw_diag_lines(out, [blue_bars_sorted[0]], 8, \"left\")\n            draw_diag_lines(out, [blue_bars_sorted[1]], 8, \"right\")\n        elif len(blue_bars_sorted) == 1:\n            # Just one, try \"left\" by default\n            draw_diag_lines(out, [blue_bars_sorted[0]], 8, \"left\")\n\n        if len(green_bars_sorted) == 2:\n            draw_diag_lines(out, [green_bars_sorted[0]], 3, \"left\")\n            draw_diag_lines(out, [green_bars_sorted[1]], 3, \"right\")\n        elif len(green_bars_sorted) == 1:\n            draw_diag_lines(out, [green_bars_sorted[0]], 3, \"left\")\n\n    # Convert to list of lists for output\n    return out.tolist()\n```\n"

performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

          "Let's carefully analyze the pattern using the provided images:\n\n**Observations:**\n\n- The input contains vertical green (3) and blue (8) bars, always in pairs for each color.\n- In the output, the bars are \"split\" into diagonal paths, with green and blue cells drawing out zig-zags or diagonals across the entire (23x17) output grid.\n- Wherever the diagonals cross, a magenta/violet cell (6) is placed at the intersection.\n- The grid is always (23x17) in output (vertical stretch).\n- Bars keep their color and get converted into long continuous zig-zag/diagonal lines.\n- Blue and green never change color; blue and green diagonals cross each other.\n- The transformation always produces the same shape pattern for diagonal paths regardless of initial positions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n- For each blue (8) or green (3) pair, find their columns or rows, create diagonals starting from their position, and fill the grid.\n- Whenever the same cell is claimed by both a blue and a green diagonal, set it to 6 (magenta).\n- Output is always 23x17.\n\n**Implementation summary:**\n\n1. Identify all blue and green \"bar\" starting columns.\n2. For each bar, initiate a diagonal line (one going bottom-left to top-right, one going top-left to bottom-right).\n3. For each step, keep the diagonals until the bounds are filled, marking cells in the output.\n4.

              "Let's carefully analyze the pattern using the provided images:\n\n**Observations:**\n\n- The input contains vertical green (3) and blue (8) bars, always in pairs for each color.\n- In the output, the bars are \"split\" into diagonal paths, with green and blue cells drawing out zig-zags or diagonals across the entire (23x17) output grid.\n- Wherever the diagonals cross, a magenta/violet cell (6) is placed at the intersection.\n- The grid is always (23x17) in output (vertical stretch).\n- Bars keep their color and get converted into long continuous zig-zag/diagonal lines.\n- Blue and green never change color; blue and green diagonals cross each other.\n- The transformation always produces the same shape pattern for diagonal paths regardless of initial positions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n- For each blue (8) or green (3) pair, find their columns or rows, create diagonals starting from their position, and fill the grid.\n- Whenever the same cell is claimed by both a blue and a green diagonal, set it to 6 (magenta).\n- Output is always 23x17.\n\n**Implementation summary:**\n\n1. Identify all blue and green \"bar\" starting columns.\n2. For each bar, initiate a diagonal line (one going bottom-left to top-right, one going top-left to bottom-right).\n3. For each step, keep the diagonals until the bounds are filled, marking cells in the output.\n4.
