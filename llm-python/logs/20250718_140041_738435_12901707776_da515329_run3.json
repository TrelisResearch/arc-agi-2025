          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1 first. The input has a bunch of 0s, but there are some 8s in specific positions. The output seems to have a more complex pattern. For instance, in the input, there's an 8 in the 10th column (assuming 0-based index) of rows 7-9. The output has 8s spread out in a way that seems to form some kind of spiral or expanding pattern. \n\nWait, maybe the 8s are being transformed into a pattern that's symmetric or follows some geometric rule. Let me check another example. \n\nIn Example 2, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has a more spread-out pattern. For example, the input has an 8 in row 4, column 5 (assuming 0-based), and the output has 8s in various positions around it. It seems like the 8s are being expanded or mirrored in some way. \n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 8s in the middle of the grid, and the output has 8s forming a kind of diamond shape expanding outward. Maybe the transformation involves expanding the 8s into a certain pattern based on their position. \n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is about creating a pattern where each 8 in the input becomes a larger structure of 8s in the output. For example, in Example 1, the 8s in the input are in positions that might be the center of a larger pattern. \n\nAnother observation: the output grids in all examples have 8s arranged in a way that seems to form concentric squares or spirals. For example, in Example 1, the output has a central area with 8s that spread outwards. \n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input, there's an 8 in row 9 (assuming rows are 0-based?), but the output has a lot of 8s in a spiral pattern. Maybe the transformation is about expanding each 8 into a square or diamond shape. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the position of the 8s. For example, if there's an 8 at (i,j), then in the output, certain positions around it are set to 8. \n\nAnother idea: the output grid is generated by some kind of cellular automaton rule. For instance, if a cell is 8 in the input, then in the output, cells in certain positions relative to it are set to 8. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output, let's take a specific cell. For instance, the input has an 8 at (9, 9) (assuming rows and columns are 0-based). In the output, there's an 8 at (9, 9), but also surrounding cells. \n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by expanding each 8 into a cross shape or a diamond. For example, each 8 in the input might generate a 3x3 square of 8s in the output, but that might not fit all examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the original 8s. For example, cells that are within a certain distance from an 8 in the input are set to 8 in the output. \n\nLooking at Example 3's input: there's an 8 in row 5, column 5 (assuming 0-based). The output has 8s forming a diamond shape around that position. For instance, in the output, there's an 8 at (5,5), and then expanding outward. \n\nAnother thought: the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input becomes a square of 8s in the output, but with some spacing. For example, if an 8 is at (i,j), then in the output, cells (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j), (i-1,j+1), (i,j-1), (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1) are set to 8. But that might not fit all examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern that's a kind of spiral or concentric squares. For example, the 8s in the input are the centers of expanding squares. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where each 8 in the input is replaced by a pattern that's a cross or diamond. \n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the output as a grid where each cell is 8 if it's within a certain distance from any 8 in the input. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in positions that are spread out. The output seems to have 8s in a way that forms a larger pattern. \n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row of the output has 8s in positions 1, 3, 4, etc. Maybe the transformation is that each 8 in the input is expanded into a larger pattern, and the output is filled with 8s where they are in certain positions relative to the input's 8s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a rule that for each cell (i,j), if the original cell is 8, then in the output, certain cells are set to 8 based on their position. \n\nAnother approach: look at the positions of the 8s in the input and output. For example, in Example 1's input, the 8s are in the 10th column (assuming 0-based) of rows 7-9. In the output, there are 8s in positions that form a spiral. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation that takes the input and creates a grid where each 8 is surrounded by 8s in a certain pattern. \n\nBut I need to find a consistent rule that applies to all examples. \n\nLet me think of the first example. The input has 8s in rows 7-9, columns 9 (assuming 0-based?), and in row 9, columns 7-9. The output seems to have a spiral pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern that's a kind of wave or expansion. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a rule where each cell (i,j) in the output is 8 if the original cell (i,j) is 8, or if there's an 8 in the original grid in a certain position relative to (i,j). \n\nAnother idea: the output grid is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is transformed into a square of 8s in the output. For example, if there's an 8 at (i,j), then the output has 8s in positions (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j), (i-1,j+1), (i,j-1), (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1). But this would create a cross shape. However, in Example 1, the output seems to have more 8s than that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is expanded into a diamond shape. For example, for each 8 at (i,j), the output has 8s in positions (i-2,j-2), (i-2,j), (i-2,j+2), (i,j-2), (i,j), (i,j+2), (i+2,j-2), (i+2,j), (i+2,j+2). But this would create a larger diamond. \n\nBut how to check this? Let's take Example 1's input. The input has an 8 at (9,9). The output has 8s around that position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern that's a spiral. For example, the 8s in the input are the starting points of a spiral that expands outward. \n\nBut how to model that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a rule that for each cell (i,j), if the original cell is 8, then in the output, certain positions are set to 8 based on their distance from the original cell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern that's a kind of reflection or rotation. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of 8s in the input and output. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 at (9,9). In the output, there's an 8 at (9,9), but also at (9,1), (1,9), etc. \n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is 0 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0. So the first row has 8s at positions 1, 3, 4, 5, ..., up to 16. That seems like a horizontal line of 8s. \n\nBut how does that relate to the input? The input has 8s in the middle of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is expanded into a square of 8s, and then the entire grid is filled with 8s based on that. \n\nBut this is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. \n\nLet me look at the output of Example 2. The input has 8s in certain positions. The output has 8s in a more spread-out pattern. For example, in the input, there's an 8 at (4,5), and in the output, there are 8s in positions that form a cross or diamond. \n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by a rule that for each cell (i,j) in the output, it is 8 if the original cell (i,j) is 8, or if there's an 8 in the original grid in a certain position relative to (i,j). For example, if the original cell is 8, then in the output, the cell is 8, and also cells that are in certain directions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is transformed into a square of 8s in the output. For example, if there's an 8 at (i,j), then the output has 8s in positions (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j), (i-1,j+1), (i,j-1), (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1). \n\nBut how would that work for the examples? Let's take Example 2. The input has an 8 at (4,5). The output would have 8s in positions around that. But in the output, there are 8s in positions that form a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a rule that for each cell (i,j) in the output, if the original cell (i,j) is 8, then in the output, the cell is 8, and also cells that are in a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are expanded into a diamond shape. For example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions (i-k,j), (i, j-k), etc. \n\nBut without seeing the exact positions, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s are mirrored or rotated. \n\nAlternatively, think about the output of Example 3. The input has 8s in the middle of the grid, and the output has a diamond shape expanding outward. For example, the input has an 8 at (5,5) (assuming 0-based), and the output has 8s in positions that form a diamond. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is expanding the 8s into a diamond shape. So, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are a certain distance away. \n\nSo, perhaps the rule is: for each cell (i,j) in the input that is 8, the output has 8s in all cells (x,y) where the Manhattan distance from (i,j) to (x,y) is less than or equal to some value. \n\nBut what value? For example, in Example 3, the input has an 8 at (5,5), and the output has 8s in positions that are up to a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is expanded into a square of 8s in the output. For example, each 8 in the input creates a square of 8s in the output. \n\nBut how to determine the exact pattern? \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of 8s in the input and output. For example, in Example 1's input, the 8s are in positions that are in the middle of the grid. The output has 8s spread out in a spiral. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s are spread out in a way that forms concentric squares. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell is 8 if it is in the same row or column as any 8 in the input, or if it's in a certain diagonal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are transformed into a grid where each 8 is replaced by a cross shape. \n\nBut I need to find a way to code this. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: for each cell in the output grid, check if it is within a certain distance from any 8 in the input. For example, if the input has an 8 at (i,j), then in the output, cells within a Manhattan distance of 2 are set to 8. \n\nBut how to determine the distance? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is expanded into a square of 8s in the output, with a certain size. For example, each 8 in the input becomes a 3x3 square of 8s in the output. \n\nBut in Example 1, the input has an 8 at (9,9), and the output has 8s around it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a square of 8s, and then the entire grid is filled with 8s where they overlap. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are the centers of expanding squares. For example, each 8 in the input is the center of a square that expands outward. \n\nBut without seeing the exact positions, it's hard to code. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is transformed into a square of 8s in the output, and the output is filled with 8s where these squares overlap. \n\nSo, for each 8 in the input, we create a square of 8s in the output. For example, if the input has an 8 at (i,j), then in the output, the cells (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j), (i-1,j+1), (i,j-1), (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1) are set to 8. \n\nBut this would create a cross shape. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nLet me try to think of this as a kernel. For each cell (i,j) in the input, if it's 8, then in the output, we set a cross around it. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output has more 8s than that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is expanded into a diamond shape. For example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions (i-k,j), (i, j-k), etc. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. \n\nAnother approach: look for the output of Example 1. The first row of the output has 8s starting at position 1 and 3. Maybe the transformation is that for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are in certain directions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s are mirrored in certain ways. \n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell is 8 if it's in the same row or column as any 8 in the input. \n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 8s in rows 7-9 and columns 9. So the output would have 8s in those rows and columns. But the output in Example 1 has 8s in other positions as well. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is transformed into a square of 8s in the output, with a certain size. For example, if the input has an 8 at (i,j), then the output has 8s in a square of size 3x3 centered at (i,j). \n\nBut this would create a 3x3 square of 8s for each input 8. \n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 8s in rows 7-9 and columns 9. So the output would have 8s in those areas, but the output also has 8s in other positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are expanded into a larger grid. For example, each 8 in the input becomes a larger square in the output. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a transformation where the 8s in the input are replaced by a pattern that expands them in all directions. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is 8 if it's within a certain distance from any 8 in the input. For example, if the input has an 8 at (i,j), then in the output, cells within a Manhattan distance of 2 are set to 8. \n\nBut how to determine the distance? \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a diamond shape. For example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions (i-1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i+1,j), and also (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1). \n\nThis would create a diamond shape. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nLet me think of the following approach: for each cell (i,j) in the input, if it's 8, then in the output, we set all cells (x,y) where |x - i| + |y - j| <= 2 to 8. \n\nBut this would create a diamond shape. \n\nLet's test this with Example 1. \n\nIn the input, there's an 8 at (9,9). The output would have 8s within a Manhattan distance of 2 from (9,9). So positions like (9,9), (9,10), (9,8), (10,9), (8,9), (9,7), (9,11), etc. But the output in Example 1 has a spiral pattern, which suggests that this might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is 3. \n\nBut without seeing the exact positions, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where each 8 in the input is expanded into a square of 8s, and then the entire grid is filled with 8s where they overlap. \n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to determine. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are transformed into a grid where each 8 is surrounded by 8s in a certain pattern. \n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are mirrored in certain ways. For example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are symmetric with respect to the center of the grid. \n\nBut how to code that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are replaced by a pattern that forms a spiral. For example, the 8s are the starting points of a spiral that expands outward. \n\nBut how to model that? \n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a pattern that fits all three examples. \n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has 8s in rows 5-6, columns 5-6. The output has 8s forming a diamond shape around those positions. \n\nFor example, in the output, the first row has an 8 at position 1, which might correspond to an 8 in the input. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are transformed into a grid where each 8 is replaced by a square of 8s in the output. \n\nBut I need to code this. \n\nLet me try to think of the following approach: for each cell (i,j) in the input, if it is 8, then in the output, we set a square of 8s centered at (i,j) with a certain size. For example, a 3x3 square. \n\nBut this would create overlapping squares. \n\nLet me try to code this. \n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\nif grid[i][j] == 8:\n\n   for dx in -1, 0, 1:\n\n       for dy in -1, 0, 1:\n\n           if 0 <= i + dx < 22 and 0 <= j + dy < 22:\n\n               output[i + dx][j + dy] = 8\n\nBut this would create a 3x3 square around each 8 in the input. \n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 8s in positions that are spread out, and the output would have 8s in those areas. \n\nBut in Example 1's output, there are more 8s than that. For example, the first row of the output has 8s in positions 1, 3, 4, etc. \n\nBut if the input has 8s in certain positions, this approach would create 3x3 squares around them. \n\nBut this might not explain the spiral pattern in Example 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a larger square. For example, a 5x5 square. \n\nBut again, without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are transformed into a grid where each 8 is replaced by a cross shape. \n\nBut I'm not making progress. \n\nMaybe I should think of the output as a grid where each cell is 8 if it's in the same row or column as any 8 in the input. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in rows 7-9 and columns 9. The output would have 8s in those rows and columns. But the output in Example 1 has 8s in other positions as well. \n\nBut this might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a grid of 8s that forms a spiral. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nLooking at Example 1, the output seems to have a spiral pattern. The input has 8s in the middle of the grid. The output has 8s expanding outward in a spiral. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to create a spiral pattern where each 8 in the input is the starting point of a spiral that expands outward. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are transformed into a grid where each 8 is replaced by a diamond shape. \n\nFor example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions (i-1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i+1,j), (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1), and (i,j). \n\nThis would create a cross and diamond shape. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nLet me try to code this. For each cell (i,j) in the input, if it is 8, then in the output, set the following positions to 8:\n\n(i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1), and (i,j). \n\nBut this would create a cross and diamond shape. \n\nBut in Example 1, this might not explain the spiral pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where each 8 in the input is replaced by a cross shape, and then the entire grid is filled with 8s where these crosses overlap. \n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to know. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make a guess. \n\nBased on the examples, the output seems to have 8s that are spread out in a way that suggests that each 8 in the input is transformed into a larger pattern. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace each 8 in the input with a larger pattern that forms a cross or diamond. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\n   if grid[i][j] == 8:\n\n       for dx in -1, 0, 1:\n\n           for dy in -1, 0, 1:\n\n               if dx == 0 or dy == 0:\n\n                   set output[i + dx][j + dy] = 8\n\nBut this would create a 3x3 square around each 8. \n\nWait, but this would create overlapping squares. \n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output would have 8s in those areas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where each 8 in the input is replaced by a larger square. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a 5x5 square. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each 8 in the input, create a 3x3 square of 8s in the output. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 22x22 grid filled with 0s\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(22)] for _ in range(22)]\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Create a 3x3 square around (i,j)\n                for dx in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dy in range(-1, 2):\n                        ni = i + dx\n                        nj = j + dy\n                        if 0 <= ni < 22 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            output[ni][nj] = 8\n    return output\n\nBut wait, this would create a 3x3 square around each 8 in the input. \n\nBut let's check with Example 1. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions. For example, the input has an 8 at (9,9). The output would have 8s in positions (8,8), (8,9), (8,10), (9,8), (9,9), (9,10), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10). \n\nBut in the output of Example 1, there are 8s in positions like (0,1), (0,3), etc. So this approach may not explain that. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 8 in the input with a larger square, but in a way that expands outward. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a cross shape, and then the entire grid is filled with 8s where these crosses overlap. \n\nBut how to code that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a square of 8s, but with a larger size. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best guess based on the examples. \n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output, the input has an 8 at (5,5) (assuming 0-based), and the output has 8s in positions that form a diamond around it. \n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is to create a diamond shape around each 8 in the input. \n\nFor example, for each 8 at (i,j), the output has 8s at positions (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1), and (i,j). \n\nThis would create a cross and diamond shape. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(22)] for _ in range(22)]\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Create a cross and diamond around (i,j)\n                for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dx == 0 or dy == 0:\n                            ni = i + dx\n                            nj = j + dy\n                            if 0 <= ni < 22 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                                output[ni][nj] = 8\n    return output\n\nBut this would set all cells within a 3x3 square around each 8. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are not just around the 8s in the input. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a larger pattern. \n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it may not fit all examples. \n\nHowever, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are not just around the input's 8s. \n\nBut perhaps the input's 8s are in positions that are the centers of these patterns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a larger square, but the code needs to be adjusted. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's output, the first row has 8s in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, ..., up to 16. This suggests that the 8s are spread out in a row. \n\nBut how does this relate to the input? \n\nMaybe the input has 8s in certain positions that are the centers of these patterns. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a larger square, and the output is filled with 8s where these squares overlap. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the code that replaces each 8 in the input with a 3x3 square of 8s in the output. \n\nBut this may not fit all examples, but it's the best I can think of now.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1 first. The input has a bunch of 0s, but there are some 8s in specific positions. The output seems to have a more complex pattern. For instance, in the input, there's an 8 in the 10th column (assuming 0-based index) of rows 7-9. The output has 8s spread out in a way that seems to form some kind of spiral or expanding pattern. \n\nWait, maybe the 8s are being transformed into a pattern that's symmetric or follows some geometric rule. Let me check another example. \n\nIn Example 2, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has a more spread-out pattern. For example, the input has an 8 in row 4, column 5 (assuming 0-based), and the output has 8s in various positions around it. It seems like the 8s are being expanded or mirrored in some way. \n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 8s in the middle of the grid, and the output has 8s forming a kind of diamond shape expanding outward. Maybe the transformation involves expanding the 8s into a certain pattern based on their position. \n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is about creating a pattern where each 8 in the input becomes a larger structure of 8s in the output. For example, in Example 1, the 8s in the input are in positions that might be the center of a larger pattern. \n\nAnother observation: the output grids in all examples have 8s arranged in a way that seems to form concentric squares or spirals. For example, in Example 1, the output has a central area with 8s that spread outwards. \n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input, there's an 8 in row 9 (assuming rows are 0-based?), but the output has a lot of 8s in a spiral pattern. Maybe the transformation is about expanding each 8 into a square or diamond shape. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the position of the 8s. For example, if there's an 8 at (i,j), then in the output, certain positions around it are set to 8. \n\nAnother idea: the output grid is generated by some kind of cellular automaton rule. For instance, if a cell is 8 in the input, then in the output, cells in certain positions relative to it are set to 8. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output, let's take a specific cell. For instance, the input has an 8 at (9, 9) (assuming rows and columns are 0-based). In the output, there's an 8 at (9, 9), but also surrounding cells. \n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by expanding each 8 into a cross shape or a diamond. For example, each 8 in the input might generate a 3x3 square of 8s in the output, but that might not fit all examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the original 8s. For example, cells that are within a certain distance from an 8 in the input are set to 8 in the output. \n\nLooking at Example 3's input: there's an 8 in row 5, column 5 (assuming 0-based). The output has 8s forming a diamond shape around that position. For instance, in the output, there's an 8 at (5,5), and then expanding outward. \n\nAnother thought: the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input becomes a square of 8s in the output, but with some spacing. For example, if an 8 is at (i,j), then in the output, cells (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j), (i-1,j+1), (i,j-1), (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1) are set to 8. But that might not fit all examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern that's a kind of spiral or concentric squares. For example, the 8s in the input are the centers of expanding squares. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where each 8 in the input is replaced by a pattern that's a cross or diamond. \n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the output as a grid where each cell is 8 if it's within a certain distance from any 8 in the input. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in positions that are spread out. The output seems to have 8s in a way that forms a larger pattern. \n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row of the output has 8s in positions 1, 3, 4, etc. Maybe the transformation is that each 8 in the input is expanded into a larger pattern, and the output is filled with 8s where they are in certain positions relative to the input's 8s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a rule that for each cell (i,j), if the original cell is 8, then in the output, certain cells are set to 8 based on their position. \n\nAnother approach: look at the positions of the 8s in the input and output. For example, in Example 1's input, the 8s are in the 10th column (assuming 0-based) of rows 7-9. In the output, there are 8s in positions that form a spiral. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation that takes the input and creates a grid where each 8 is surrounded by 8s in a certain pattern. \n\nBut I need to find a consistent rule that applies to all examples. \n\nLet me think of the first example. The input has 8s in rows 7-9, columns 9 (assuming 0-based?), and in row 9, columns 7-9. The output seems to have a spiral pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern that's a kind of wave or expansion. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a rule where each cell (i,j) in the output is 8 if the original cell (i,j) is 8, or if there's an 8 in the original grid in a certain position relative to (i,j). \n\nAnother idea: the output grid is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is transformed into a square of 8s in the output. For example, if there's an 8 at (i,j), then the output has 8s in positions (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j), (i-1,j+1), (i,j-1), (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1). But this would create a cross shape. However, in Example 1, the output seems to have more 8s than that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is expanded into a diamond shape. For example, for each 8 at (i,j), the output has 8s in positions (i-2,j-2), (i-2,j), (i-2,j+2), (i,j-2), (i,j), (i,j+2), (i+2,j-2), (i+2,j), (i+2,j+2). But this would create a larger diamond. \n\nBut how to check this? Let's take Example 1's input. The input has an 8 at (9,9). The output has 8s around that position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern that's a spiral. For example, the 8s in the input are the starting points of a spiral that expands outward. \n\nBut how to model that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a rule that for each cell (i,j), if the original cell is 8, then in the output, certain positions are set to 8 based on their distance from the original cell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern that's a kind of reflection or rotation. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of 8s in the input and output. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 at (9,9). In the output, there's an 8 at (9,9), but also at (9,1), (1,9), etc. \n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is 0 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0. So the first row has 8s at positions 1, 3, 4, 5, ..., up to 16. That seems like a horizontal line of 8s. \n\nBut how does that relate to the input? The input has 8s in the middle of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is expanded into a square of 8s, and then the entire grid is filled with 8s based on that. \n\nBut this is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. \n\nLet me look at the output of Example 2. The input has 8s in certain positions. The output has 8s in a more spread-out pattern. For example, in the input, there's an 8 at (4,5), and in the output, there are 8s in positions that form a cross or diamond. \n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by a rule that for each cell (i,j) in the output, it is 8 if the original cell (i,j) is 8, or if there's an 8 in the original grid in a certain position relative to (i,j). For example, if the original cell is 8, then in the output, the cell is 8, and also cells that are in certain directions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is transformed into a square of 8s in the output. For example, if there's an 8 at (i,j), then the output has 8s in positions (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j), (i-1,j+1), (i,j-1), (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1). \n\nBut how would that work for the examples? Let's take Example 2. The input has an 8 at (4,5). The output would have 8s in positions around that. But in the output, there are 8s in positions that form a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a rule that for each cell (i,j) in the output, if the original cell (i,j) is 8, then in the output, the cell is 8, and also cells that are in a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are expanded into a diamond shape. For example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions (i-k,j), (i, j-k), etc. \n\nBut without seeing the exact positions, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s are mirrored or rotated. \n\nAlternatively, think about the output of Example 3. The input has 8s in the middle of the grid, and the output has a diamond shape expanding outward. For example, the input has an 8 at (5,5) (assuming 0-based), and the output has 8s in positions that form a diamond. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is expanding the 8s into a diamond shape. So, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are a certain distance away. \n\nSo, perhaps the rule is: for each cell (i,j) in the input that is 8, the output has 8s in all cells (x,y) where the Manhattan distance from (i,j) to (x,y) is less than or equal to some value. \n\nBut what value? For example, in Example 3, the input has an 8 at (5,5), and the output has 8s in positions that are up to a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is expanded into a square of 8s in the output. For example, each 8 in the input creates a square of 8s in the output. \n\nBut how to determine the exact pattern? \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of 8s in the input and output. For example, in Example 1's input, the 8s are in positions that are in the middle of the grid. The output has 8s spread out in a spiral. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s are spread out in a way that forms concentric squares. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell is 8 if it is in the same row or column as any 8 in the input, or if it's in a certain diagonal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are transformed into a grid where each 8 is replaced by a cross shape. \n\nBut I need to find a way to code this. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: for each cell in the output grid, check if it is within a certain distance from any 8 in the input. For example, if the input has an 8 at (i,j), then in the output, cells within a Manhattan distance of 2 are set to 8. \n\nBut how to determine the distance? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is expanded into a square of 8s in the output, with a certain size. For example, each 8 in the input becomes a 3x3 square of 8s in the output. \n\nBut in Example 1, the input has an 8 at (9,9), and the output has 8s around it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a square of 8s, and then the entire grid is filled with 8s where they overlap. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are the centers of expanding squares. For example, each 8 in the input is the center of a square that expands outward. \n\nBut without seeing the exact positions, it's hard to code. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is transformed into a square of 8s in the output, and the output is filled with 8s where these squares overlap. \n\nSo, for each 8 in the input, we create a square of 8s in the output. For example, if the input has an 8 at (i,j), then in the output, the cells (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j), (i-1,j+1), (i,j-1), (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1) are set to 8. \n\nBut this would create a cross shape. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nLet me try to think of this as a kernel. For each cell (i,j) in the input, if it's 8, then in the output, we set a cross around it. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output has more 8s than that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is expanded into a diamond shape. For example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions (i-k,j), (i, j-k), etc. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. \n\nAnother approach: look for the output of Example 1. The first row of the output has 8s starting at position 1 and 3. Maybe the transformation is that for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are in certain directions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s are mirrored in certain ways. \n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell is 8 if it's in the same row or column as any 8 in the input. \n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 8s in rows 7-9 and columns 9. So the output would have 8s in those rows and columns. But the output in Example 1 has 8s in other positions as well. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is transformed into a square of 8s in the output, with a certain size. For example, if the input has an 8 at (i,j), then the output has 8s in a square of size 3x3 centered at (i,j). \n\nBut this would create a 3x3 square of 8s for each input 8. \n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 8s in rows 7-9 and columns 9. So the output would have 8s in those areas, but the output also has 8s in other positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are expanded into a larger grid. For example, each 8 in the input becomes a larger square in the output. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a transformation where the 8s in the input are replaced by a pattern that expands them in all directions. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is 8 if it's within a certain distance from any 8 in the input. For example, if the input has an 8 at (i,j), then in the output, cells within a Manhattan distance of 2 are set to 8. \n\nBut how to determine the distance? \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a diamond shape. For example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions (i-1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i+1,j), and also (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1). \n\nThis would create a diamond shape. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nLet me think of the following approach: for each cell (i,j) in the input, if it's 8, then in the output, we set all cells (x,y) where |x - i| + |y - j| <= 2 to 8. \n\nBut this would create a diamond shape. \n\nLet's test this with Example 1. \n\nIn the input, there's an 8 at (9,9). The output would have 8s within a Manhattan distance of 2 from (9,9). So positions like (9,9), (9,10), (9,8), (10,9), (8,9), (9,7), (9,11), etc. But the output in Example 1 has a spiral pattern, which suggests that this might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is 3. \n\nBut without seeing the exact positions, it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where each 8 in the input is expanded into a square of 8s, and then the entire grid is filled with 8s where they overlap. \n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to determine. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are transformed into a grid where each 8 is surrounded by 8s in a certain pattern. \n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are mirrored in certain ways. For example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are symmetric with respect to the center of the grid. \n\nBut how to code that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are replaced by a pattern that forms a spiral. For example, the 8s are the starting points of a spiral that expands outward. \n\nBut how to model that? \n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a pattern that fits all three examples. \n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has 8s in rows 5-6, columns 5-6. The output has 8s forming a diamond shape around those positions. \n\nFor example, in the output, the first row has an 8 at position 1, which might correspond to an 8 in the input. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are transformed into a grid where each 8 is replaced by a square of 8s in the output. \n\nBut I need to code this. \n\nLet me try to think of the following approach: for each cell (i,j) in the input, if it is 8, then in the output, we set a square of 8s centered at (i,j) with a certain size. For example, a 3x3 square. \n\nBut this would create overlapping squares. \n\nLet me try to code this. \n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\nif grid[i][j] == 8:\n\n   for dx in -1, 0, 1:\n\n       for dy in -1, 0, 1:\n\n           if 0 <= i + dx < 22 and 0 <= j + dy < 22:\n\n               output[i + dx][j + dy] = 8\n\nBut this would create a 3x3 square around each 8 in the input. \n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 8s in positions that are spread out, and the output would have 8s in those areas. \n\nBut in Example 1's output, there are more 8s than that. For example, the first row of the output has 8s in positions 1, 3, 4, etc. \n\nBut if the input has 8s in certain positions, this approach would create 3x3 squares around them. \n\nBut this might not explain the spiral pattern in Example 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a larger square. For example, a 5x5 square. \n\nBut again, without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are transformed into a grid where each 8 is replaced by a cross shape. \n\nBut I'm not making progress. \n\nMaybe I should think of the output as a grid where each cell is 8 if it's in the same row or column as any 8 in the input. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in rows 7-9 and columns 9. The output would have 8s in those rows and columns. But the output in Example 1 has 8s in other positions as well. \n\nBut this might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a grid of 8s that forms a spiral. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nLooking at Example 1, the output seems to have a spiral pattern. The input has 8s in the middle of the grid. The output has 8s expanding outward in a spiral. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to create a spiral pattern where each 8 in the input is the starting point of a spiral that expands outward. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 8s in the input are transformed into a grid where each 8 is replaced by a diamond shape. \n\nFor example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions (i-1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i+1,j), (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1), and (i,j). \n\nThis would create a cross and diamond shape. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nLet me try to code this. For each cell (i,j) in the input, if it is 8, then in the output, set the following positions to 8:\n\n(i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1), and (i,j). \n\nBut this would create a cross and diamond shape. \n\nBut in Example 1, this might not explain the spiral pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where each 8 in the input is replaced by a cross shape, and then the entire grid is filled with 8s where these crosses overlap. \n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to know. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make a guess. \n\nBased on the examples, the output seems to have 8s that are spread out in a way that suggests that each 8 in the input is transformed into a larger pattern. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace each 8 in the input with a larger pattern that forms a cross or diamond. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\n   if grid[i][j] == 8:\n\n       for dx in -1, 0, 1:\n\n           for dy in -1, 0, 1:\n\n               if dx == 0 or dy == 0:\n\n                   set output[i + dx][j + dy] = 8\n\nBut this would create a 3x3 square around each 8. \n\nWait, but this would create overlapping squares. \n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output would have 8s in those areas. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where each 8 in the input is replaced by a larger square. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a 5x5 square. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each 8 in the input, create a 3x3 square of 8s in the output. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 22x22 grid filled with 0s\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(22)] for _ in range(22)]\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Create a 3x3 square around (i,j)\n                for dx in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dy in range(-1, 2):\n                        ni = i + dx\n                        nj = j + dy\n                        if 0 <= ni < 22 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            output[ni][nj] = 8\n    return output\n\nBut wait, this would create a 3x3 square around each 8 in the input. \n\nBut let's check with Example 1. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions. For example, the input has an 8 at (9,9). The output would have 8s in positions (8,8), (8,9), (8,10), (9,8), (9,9), (9,10), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10). \n\nBut in the output of Example 1, there are 8s in positions like (0,1), (0,3), etc. So this approach may not explain that. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 8 in the input with a larger square, but in a way that expands outward. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a cross shape, and then the entire grid is filled with 8s where these crosses overlap. \n\nBut how to code that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a square of 8s, but with a larger size. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best guess based on the examples. \n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output, the input has an 8 at (5,5) (assuming 0-based), and the output has 8s in positions that form a diamond around it. \n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is to create a diamond shape around each 8 in the input. \n\nFor example, for each 8 at (i,j), the output has 8s at positions (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1), and (i,j). \n\nThis would create a cross and diamond shape. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(22)] for _ in range(22)]\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Create a cross and diamond around (i,j)\n                for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dx == 0 or dy == 0:\n                            ni = i + dx\n                            nj = j + dy\n                            if 0 <= ni < 22 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                                output[ni][nj] = 8\n    return output\n\nBut this would set all cells within a 3x3 square around each 8. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are not just around the 8s in the input. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a larger pattern. \n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it may not fit all examples. \n\nHowever, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are not just around the input's 8s. \n\nBut perhaps the input's 8s are in positions that are the centers of these patterns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a larger square, but the code needs to be adjusted. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's output, the first row has 8s in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, ..., up to 16. This suggests that the 8s are spread out in a row. \n\nBut how does this relate to the input? \n\nMaybe the input has 8s in certain positions that are the centers of these patterns. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a pattern where each 8 in the input is replaced by a larger square, and the output is filled with 8s where these squares overlap. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the code that replaces each 8 in the input with a 3x3 square of 8s in the output. \n\nBut this may not fit all examples, but it's the best I can think of now.\n"
