          "Analyzing the training examples, some patterns emerge:\n\n- Example 1:\n  - Input: a small grid with a '5' in certain positions.\n  - Output: the '5's are expanded or mirrored into a larger grid, often in a diagonal or pattern-like shape, with some additional small shapes (like '1's) also positioned in certain places.\n  \n- Example 2:\n  - Input: a 2x2 block of the same digit.\n  - Output: a 4x4 grid where the top-left quarter is the same digit, the bottom right contains a diagonal of '1's, and the rest is zero, suggesting expansion and diagonal placement.\n  \n- Example 3:\n  - Input: a few '3's positioned irregularly.\n  - Output: a larger grid with '3's placed at corners, and a diagonal of '1's from top-left to bottom-right, with pyramids of '1's near the '3's.\n\nThe common themes:\n- Expand the input pattern into a larger grid (often 10x10).\n- Place the input shape at specific positions (e.g., top-left).\n- Often generate diagonal lines with '1's extending across the grid from corners or start points.\n- In some cases, shape is reflected or extended into larger grids with added features.\n\nGiven the above, the test input:\n```\n0 4 0\n0 0 0\n4 0 0\n```\nincludes two '4's at positions (0,1) and (2,0). Based on patterns:\n- The input is a small pattern; expanding it to a 10x10 grid might involve placing '4's in top-left corner, and creating a diagonal line of '1's from top-left to bottom-right.\n- Other examples often involve diagonals of '1's, with the original shape placed at the start.\n\n**Hypothesis for transformation:**\n- Create a 10x10 grid initialized with zeros.\n- Place the input's non-zero elements at the top-left corner.\n- Fill the main diagonal with '1's, creating a diagonal line across the grid.\n- For each non-zero input, mark the corresponding position in the output with that value.\n\nThis combines the pattern of expanding shapes and drawing diagonals.\n\n---\n\n**Code implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    size = 10\n    output = np.zeros((size, size), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Place the input pattern at top-left corner\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                output[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n                \n    # Fill the main diagonal with '1's\n    for i in range(min(size, rows, cols)):\n        output[i][i] = 1\n    \n    return output.tolist()\n```\n\nThis approach:\n- Places input pattern at top-left\n- Creates a diagonal of '1's across the grid\n- Maintains original non-zero positions\n\nIt attempts to match the observed pattern of input expansion + diagonal line, aligning with the training examples.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
