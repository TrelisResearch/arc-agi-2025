          "Let's analyze the pattern from the given training examples and the visual:\n\nTraining examples:\n\n- Each input has two groups of colored vertical bars on the left (each group stacked in a column, with distinct colors).\n- The main shape in the center to right is gray (same value in all examples, either 5 or 7).\n- Output changes only the gray shape pixels **by replacing gray pixels with the color of the left vertical bar in the row they appear in**.\n- More specifically:\n  - In Input 1, vertical bars colors on left side are two columns:\n    - First column (top to bottom): colors [8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2]\n    - Second column similar but contains some other color 5, replaced with first column colors in output\n  - Command is: all gray cells replaced with the color of the first left vertical bar in that row (column 0).\n- This holds similarly for Input 2, with left bars [9,9,6,6,6,4,4,4] replacing gray cells.\n- The gray shape is unchanged in shape (positions) but the pixel color changes from gray (5) to the left vertical bar color in the output.\n\nVisual confirms:\n- In input images, left vertical bars are colored distinctively.\n- Gray shape pixels are replaced by the left colored bar pixel on the same row.\n\nTest input matches this pattern:\n- On the left side, vertical bars have colors [red, green, yellow, orange] in column 0.\n- The grey pixels should be replaced by the color on the same row in the first column.\n\nOur transformation approach:\n\n1. Identify \"gray\" pixels in input grids. Based on examples, gray pixels are represented by color 5 (or 7?), but both examples are 5 for gray shape.\n2. For each cell that is gray (5), replace it in output with the color of the pixel in column 0 of the same row (which is the vertical bar).\n3. For all other pixels, keep them unchanged.\n\nNote:\n- In the first examples, pixels with value 5 are gray shape pixels changed.\n- Colors in first column are changed pixels.\n- Non-gray pixels preserved.\n\nAdditional:\n- The visual uses actual colors, but input numbers correspond to colors.\n- We'll apply general logic: gray pixels = 5; other pixels are untouched except we clone input to output and replace gray pixels with first column element of that row.\n\nFinal code will reflect this.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create deep copy of the grid for output\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for r in range(10):\n        left_color = grid[r][0]\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:  # gray shape pixels identified with 5\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = left_color\n    return transformed_grid\n```"

              "Let's analyze the pattern from the given training examples and the visual:\n\nTraining examples:\n\n- Each input has two groups of colored vertical bars on the left (each group stacked in a column, with distinct colors).\n- The main shape in the center to right is gray (same value in all examples, either 5 or 7).\n- Output changes only the gray shape pixels **by replacing gray pixels with the color of the left vertical bar in the row they appear in**.\n- More specifically:\n  - In Input 1, vertical bars colors on left side are two columns:\n    - First column (top to bottom): colors [8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2]\n    - Second column similar but contains some other color 5, replaced with first column colors in output\n  - Command is: all gray cells replaced with the color of the first left vertical bar in that row (column 0).\n- This holds similarly for Input 2, with left bars [9,9,6,6,6,4,4,4] replacing gray cells.\n- The gray shape is unchanged in shape (positions) but the pixel color changes from gray (5) to the left vertical bar color in the output.\n\nVisual confirms:\n- In input images, left vertical bars are colored distinctively.\n- Gray shape pixels are replaced by the left colored bar pixel on the same row.\n\nTest input matches this pattern:\n- On the left side, vertical bars have colors [red, green, yellow, orange] in column 0.\n- The grey pixels should be replaced by the color on the same row in the first column.\n\nOur transformation approach:\n\n1. Identify \"gray\" pixels in input grids. Based on examples, gray pixels are represented by color 5 (or 7?), but both examples are 5 for gray shape.\n2. For each cell that is gray (5), replace it in output with the color of the pixel in column 0 of the same row (which is the vertical bar).\n3. For all other pixels, keep them unchanged.\n\nNote:\n- In the first examples, pixels with value 5 are gray shape pixels changed.\n- Colors in first column are changed pixels.\n- Non-gray pixels preserved.\n\nAdditional:\n- The visual uses actual colors, but input numbers correspond to colors.\n- We'll apply general logic: gray pixels = 5; other pixels are untouched except we clone input to output and replace gray pixels with first column element of that row.\n\nFinal code will reflect this.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create deep copy of the grid for output\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for r in range(10):\n        left_color = grid[r][0]\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:  # gray shape pixels identified with 5\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = left_color\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
