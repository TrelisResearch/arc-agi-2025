          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, there are two examples given. Let me look at them closely.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 10x10. The input has some 8s and 0s, and the output has some changes. For instance, in the third row of the input, the third column is 0, and in the output, it's 0, but the seventh column changes from 1 to 4. Wait, maybe there's some kind of transformation based on the positions of certain numbers?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column changes from 1 to 4. Let me check other rows. In row 5 of the input, the seventh column is 0, but in the output, it's 4. Hmm, maybe it's related to the positions of 0s and 8s? Or maybe some kind of counting?\n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being replaced based on their neighbors. Let me check Example 2. The input has a lot of 8s and some other numbers. The output seems to have some numbers replaced. For example, in the third row of input, the fifth column is 2, and in the output, it's 4. Wait, but in the output of Example 2, the third row's fifth column is 4. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers are being replaced based on their position relative to other numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of distance or count of certain numbers in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have some numbers that are replaced with values that are higher. Let me check the first example again.\n\nIn the input of Example 1, the third row is 8 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. The output for that row is 8 8 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0. So the seventh column changes from 1 to 4. Similarly, in row 5 of the input, the seventh column is 0, but in the output, it's 4. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at row 7 of Example 1's input: 8 8 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0. The output is 8 8 0 0 3 0 0 2 0 0. So the fifth column changes from 1 to 3, and the eighth column changes from 1 to 2. Hmm, maybe these numbers are being replaced based on some count of surrounding cells?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the seventh column in the third row is 1, which becomes 4. Maybe that's related to the number of 0s in that row or column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being replaced with the sum of their neighbors. But that might be too complex.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a 4 in the first row, and the output has the same 4. The input has a 2 in the third row, fifth column, and the output has 4 there. Wait, maybe it's related to the number of 8s in the grid? Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have some numbers that are replaced with values that are higher. Let me check the first example again.\n\nIn the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 4. The input's third row's seventh column is 1. But in the input's third row, there's a 1 in the seventh column. Maybe that's a clue. Wait, in the input, the third row's seventh column is 1, but in the output, it's 4. Maybe that's because there are some other numbers in the grid that influence this cell. For example, maybe the number of 8s in the row or column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 0s in the row or column. For instance, in the third row of the input, there are several 0s. The seventh column is 1. But in the output, that cell becomes 4. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the third row of Example 1, the seventh column is 1, and in the output, it's 4. Maybe the position (row, column) is being used to calculate a value. For example, row 3 (0-based?), column 7 (0-based?), maybe 3 + 7 = 10, but that's not matching. Or maybe some other formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are being replaced with the number of times a certain value appears in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in some positions. Maybe that's the count of 8s in the grid. Let me check the input of Example 1. The input has a lot of 8s. For example, the first row is all 8s except for the first two elements. The second row is 3, 2, then 8s. The third row has 0s and a 1. So maybe the count of 8s in the grid is 8, but that's not matching the 4s in the output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of 0s and 8s. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in certain positions. Maybe those positions are where there are 0s in the input, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 4. The input's third row has a 1 there. Maybe that's because there are some other numbers in the grid that influence that cell. For example, maybe the number of 8s in that row or column. Let's check.\n\nIn the third row of the input, the row is 8 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. So there are 2 8s. The column 7 (assuming 0-based) for that row is 1. But the output is 4. Maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of times a certain value appears in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in some positions. Maybe that's the number of 0s in the grid. But that would be a lot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid transformation where certain cells are being replaced based on their neighbors. For example, in Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 1, and in the output it's 4. Maybe that's the sum of the surrounding cells. Let's check the surrounding cells. The cell is in row 2 (assuming 0-based?), column 6. The surrounding cells would be up, down, left, right. Let's see:\n\nIn the input, row 2 (third row) is [8,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. So the cell at (2,6) is 1. The surrounding cells would be (1,6) which is 8, (3,6) which is 0, (2,5) which is 0, (2,7) which is 0. Sum is 8+0+0+0=8. But the output is 4. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the cells in the same row and column. For example, the row has 8,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0. The column 6 (assuming 0-based) is 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, maybe not. Maybe the sum of the row and column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 0s in the row and column. For example, in the third row of the input, there are 7 zeros. But that's not matching the 4 in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain positions are being replaced with the number of times a certain value appears in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in some positions. Maybe that's the count of 8s in the grid. Let me count the 8s in the input of Example 1.\n\nLooking at the input of Example 1:\n\nRow 0: 1 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 \u2192 8 8s (positions 2-9)\nRow 1: 3 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 \u2192 8 8s (positions 2-9)\nRow 2: 8 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nRow 3: 8 8 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nRow 4: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nRow 5: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nRow 6: 8 8 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nRow 7: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nRow 8: 8 8 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nRow 9: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nTotal 8s: Let's count. Rows 0 and 1 have 8 each (8*2=16). Rows 2-9 have 2 each, that's 8 rows * 2 = 16. Total 32 8s. So if the output has 4 in some positions, maybe that's the count divided by something. 32/8=4. So maybe the output is replacing certain cells with the total count of 8s divided by 8? But that's just a guess.\n\nIn the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 4. Which is 32/8=4. Maybe that's the case. But then why would that be the case? Maybe the transformation is that for certain cells, they are replaced with the total number of 8s in the grid divided by 8. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced with the number of 8s in the grid. For example, if the total number of 8s is 32, then maybe some cells are replaced with 32. But in the output, it's 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the cells that are 0 in the input are being replaced with the number of 8s in the grid divided by something. But that seems too vague.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. Let's see. The input of Example 2 has a row that starts with 8s and ends with 4, 6. The output has the same 4 and 6. But in the third row of input, the fifth column is 2, and in the output, it's 4. Maybe that's because there are more 8s in the grid? Let's count the 8s in Example 2's input.\n\nThe input of Example 2 is a 12x12 grid. Wait, the input for Example 2 is 12 rows, each with 12 elements. But the output is 12x12 as well. But the test input is 12x12 as well. Wait, but the problem says that the test input is 12x12? Wait, the test input is given as 12 rows, each with 12 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 10x10. Wait, no, the problem says that the function must return a 10x10 grid. Wait, the training examples have 10x10 grids. But the test input is 12x12? That seems conflicting. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the test input is shown as:\n\nTest Input:\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n...\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 3 1\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 7 4\n\nSo that's 12 rows, each with 14 elements. Wait, but the problem says that the output must be 10x10. That's confusing. But the problem says that the function must take a 2D list (grid) and return a 10x10 grid. So maybe the test input is for a different problem? Or perhaps there's a mistake. But the training examples are 10x10. So the function must take a grid of any size and return a 10x10 grid? Or perhaps the test input is part of the problem, but the function is supposed to handle 10x10 grids. Maybe the test input is for a different purpose, but the function is supposed to take a 10x10 grid and return a 10x10 grid. So the training examples are 10x10, and the test input is 12x12, but the function is supposed to process 10x10 grids. So perhaps the test input is not part of the training examples, but the function is supposed to take a 10x10 grid and return a 10x10 grid.\n\nBut that's not clear. However, the problem says that the function must return a 10x10 grid. So regardless of the input size, the output must be 10x10. But in the training examples, the input is 10x10, and the output is 10x10. So for the function, the input is a 10x10 grid, and the output is also 10x10.\n\nSo, back to the training examples. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 4 in some positions. Let me think about the positions where the output changes. For instance, in the third row of the input, the seventh column is 1. In the output, it's 4. Also, in row 5 of the input, the seventh column is 0, and in the output, it's 4. Maybe that's because those positions are in certain regions of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 0s in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the input has a certain number of 0s, and the output replaces some cells with that count divided by something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in positions where there are 0s in the input. But in the third row, the seventh column is 1 in the input, but it's 4 in the output. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where the number in the output is the sum of the numbers in the same row and column. For example, in the third row of the input, the seventh column is 1. The sum of the row is 8+8+0+0+0+0+1+0+0+0 = 17. The column 7 (assuming 0-based) has values: row 0:8, row1:8, row2:0, row3:0, row4:1, row5:0, row6:1, row7:1, row8:0, row9:0. Sum is 8+8+0+0+1+0+1+1+0+0 = 19. So sum of row and column is 17+19=36. Not sure how that would relate to 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing certain cells with the number of times a certain value appears in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in some positions. Maybe that's the count of 8s in the grid divided by 8 (32/8=4). But why would that be the case?\n\nIf that's the case, then in Example 1, the output replaces certain cells with 4, which is 32/8. But in Example 2, what's the count of 8s? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 2's input, the first row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 6. So 10 8s. Then the second row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 2 \u2192 10 8s. Third row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Fourth row: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Fifth row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Sixth row: 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 8 8 \u2192 4 8s. Seventh row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Eighth row: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Ninth row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Tenth row: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Eleventh row: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Twelfth row: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. \n\nAdding up all the 8s: \n\nRows 0 and 1: 10 each \u2192 20. \n\nRow 2: 2 \u2192 total 22. \n\nRow 3: 2 \u2192 24. \n\nRow 4: 2 \u2192 26. \n\nRow 5: 4 \u2192 30. \n\nRow 6: 2 \u2192 32. \n\nRow 7: 2 \u2192 34. \n\nRow 8: 2 \u2192 36. \n\nRow 9: 2 \u2192 38. \n\nRow 10: 2 \u2192 40. \n\nRow 11: 2 \u2192 42. \n\nSo total 42 8s. \n\nIn the output of Example 2, the third row's fifth column is 4. 42 divided by 10.5 is 4. But that's not an integer. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the count of 8s is 42, and in the output, some positions are replaced with 4. Maybe that's because 42 divided by something. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is replacing certain cells with the number of 8s in the grid. But that would mean that in Example 1, the output has 4 in some positions, which is 32/8. But 32 is the count of 8s in Example 1. So 32 divided by 8 is 4. Maybe that's the pattern. So in Example 1, the output replaces certain cells with the total count of 8s divided by 8. But why 8?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is replacing certain cells with the number of 8s in the grid divided by the number of rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, 32 / 10 = 3.2, but the output has 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 1 in the seventh column, which is replaced with 4. Maybe that's because there are 4 zeros in the grid. Let's count the number of zeros in Example 1's input. \n\nLooking at the input of Example 1:\n\nRow 0: 1 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 \u2192 no zeros.\n\nRow 1: 3 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 \u2192 no zeros.\n\nRow 2: 8 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 \u2192 5 zeros.\n\nRow 3: 8 8 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 5 zeros.\n\nRow 4: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 \u2192 4 zeros.\n\nRow 5: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 6 zeros.\n\nRow 6: 8 8 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 4 zeros.\n\nRow 7: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 4 zeros.\n\nRow 8: 8 8 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 \u2192 4 zeros.\n\nRow 9: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \u2192 5 zeros.\n\nTotal zeros: 5+5+4+6+4+4+4+5 = 37? Let me recount:\n\nRow 2: 5 zeros (positions 2-5, 7-9 \u2192 5 zeros? Or positions 2,3,4,5,7,8,9 \u2192 7 zeros? Wait, row 2 is [8,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. So positions 2,3,4,5,7,8,9 \u2192 7 zeros. So row 2 has 7 zeros.\n\nRow 3: [8,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So positions 2,4,5,6,7,8,9 \u2192 7 zeros.\n\nRow 4: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1]. Positions 2,3,4,5,6,8 \u2192 6 zeros.\n\nRow 5: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 7 zeros.\n\nRow 6: [8,8,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 positions 2,3,5,6,8,9 \u2192 6 zeros.\n\nRow 7: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 positions 2,3,4,5,6,8,9 \u2192 7 zeros.\n\nRow 8: [8,8,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0] \u2192 positions 2,4,5,8,9 \u2192 5 zeros.\n\nRow 9: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 positions 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 \u2192 7 zeros.\n\nSo total zeros:\n\nRow 2:7, row3:7, row4:6, row5:7, row6:6, row7:7, row8:5, row9:7 \u2192 sum is 7+7=14, +6=20, +7=27, +6=33, +7=40, +5=45, +7=52. So total 52 zeros.\n\nIn the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 4. 52 divided by 13 is 4. But why 13? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of zeros is 52, and the output replaces certain cells with the number of zeros divided by something. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that cells with 0 in the input are replaced with the number of 8s in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 1, which is not zero. But in the output, it's 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s and 8s in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 1 in the seventh column, which is replaced with 4. Maybe that's because the seventh column has a certain number of 8s. Let's check the seventh column (index 6, assuming 0-based) in the input of Example 1:\n\nRow 0: 8\n\nRow 1: 8\n\nRow 2: 1\n\nRow 3: 0\n\nRow 4: 0\n\nRow 5: 0\n\nRow 6: 0\n\nRow 7: 1\n\nRow 8: 1\n\nRow 9: 0\n\nSo the seventh column has values: 8,8,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0. The sum is 8+8+1+0+0+0+0+1+1+0 = 19. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain cells, the output is the number of times a certain value appears in the row or column. For example, in the third row of Example 1, the seventh column is 1, and in the output it's 4. Maybe the number of 0s in that row is 7, and the output is 7-3=4? Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern in the positions where the numbers change.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the third row has 4 in the seventh column. The seventh column in the input was 1. In row 5 of the input, the seventh column is 0, and in the output it's 4. In row 7 of the input, the fifth column is 1, and in the output it's 3. In row 8 of the input, the fourth column is 1, and in the output it's 3. \n\nLooking at these positions, maybe they are in certain regions of the grid. For example, the seventh column in rows 2, 5, 7, etc. Maybe those are positions where there are certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s. For example, in the input, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with a certain value based on its position. But in the input, the third row's seventh column is 1, which is replaced with 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 8s in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the number of 8s is 32. So 32 divided by 8 is 4. So maybe the output replaces certain cells with 4. But why 8? It's possible that the transformation is that certain cells are replaced with the total number of 8s in the grid divided by 8, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is replacing certain cells with the number of 8s in the grid, but only for certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in certain positions, and the total number of 8s is 32. So 32/8=4. So maybe the cells that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 4.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are being replaced? Maybe the cells that are in certain positions, like the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's a 0, it's replaced with the number of 8s in the grid divided by something. But again, this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s and 8s in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 1, which is replaced with 4. Maybe that's because the cell is in a certain position where there are 4 8s in the row or column.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern where certain cells are replaced with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8, or some similar calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's 0, it's replaced with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8. But in Example 1, the output has 4 in some positions, which is 32/8=4. So if the cell is 0, it's replaced with 4. But in the input, the third row's seventh column is 1, not 0, so it's not replaced. But in the output, it's 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8, regardless of their value. But that would mean that all cells are replaced with 4 in Example 1, which is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 8s in the grid and the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with 4. But how to determine that?\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should think of other patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in certain positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, the third row's seventh column is in the middle of the grid (since it's 10x10). Maybe the transformation is that certain cells in the middle are replaced with 4, but this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where the cells that are 0 in the input are replaced with 4, and other cells are unchanged. But in the input of Example 1, there are 0s, and the output has 4s in some positions. But in the input's third row, the seventh column is 1, which is replaced with 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, except for certain cells where the value is replaced with the number of 8s in the grid. But in Example 1, that would mean that all cells are replaced with 4, which is not the case.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's look at the outputs of the two examples and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 4 in certain positions. In Example 2, the output has 4 in certain positions as well. For example, in Example 2's output, the third row's fifth column is 4, which was 2 in the input. So maybe that's because the number of 8s in the grid is 42, and 42 divided by 10.5 is 4, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 8s in the grid, and for each cell, if it's in a certain position, it's replaced with the number of 8s divided by some value. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s and 8s in the grid, and for each cell, the output is the number of 8s in the grid if the cell is 0, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with 4. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it's a 0, it's replaced with the number of 8s in the grid. But in Example 1, the number of 8s is 32, so 32 would be the value for those cells. But in the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 4, not 32. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with some cells replaced with 4 based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain cells are replaced with 4. But how to determine which cells?\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Let's think of the following hypothesis: the transformation replaces certain cells with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8, and those cells are those that are in the middle of the grid.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the number of 8s is 32. 32/8 = 4. So those cells that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 4.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are in the middle? For a 10x10 grid, the middle would be around row 4-5, column 4-5. But in the output of Example 1, the third row (row 2) has a 4 in column 6 (assuming 0-based). That's not in the middle. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cells that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 4. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with 4 if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the third row's seventh column is replaced with 4. Maybe that's because it's in a certain position.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in the seventh column of row 2, and in row 5, column 6. Maybe those are positions where there are 0s in the input. But in row 2, column 6 is 1, not 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with the number of 8s in the row or column. For example, in row 2 of Example 1, the seventh column is 1. The number of 8s in that row is 2. But the output is 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with the number of 8s in the row. For example, in row 2 of Example 1, there are 2 8s. But the output is 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with the number of 8s in the column. For example, in column 6 of Example 1, the number of 8s is 8 (row 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9? Wait, column 6 in Example 1's input is:\n\nRow 0: 8\n\nRow 1: 8\n\nRow 2: 1\n\nRow 3: 0\n\nRow 4: 0\n\nRow 5: 0\n\nRow 6: 0\n\nRow 7: 1\n\nRow 8: 1\n\nRow 9: 0\n\nSo the number of 8s in column 6 is 2 (rows 0 and 1). So 2, but the output is 4. Not matching.\n\nThis is very challenging. Given the time I have, perhaps I should proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is replacing certain cells with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8, and those cells are in certain positions.\n\nSo, for example, in Example 1, the number of 8s is 32. 32/8=4. So the output replaces certain cells with 4. But which cells?\n\nMaybe the cells that are in the middle of the grid. For example, the middle of the grid is around row 4-5, column 4-5. But in the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 4. That's not in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cells that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 4. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with 4 if they are in the same row or column as a 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with 4 based on the number of 0s in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the number of 0s is 52. 52 divided by 13 is 4. So maybe the cells that are in the middle are replaced with 4.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation replaces certain cells with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8, and those cells are in positions where the original value is 1. For example, in Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 1, which is replaced with 4. In Example 2, the third row's fifth column is 2, which is replaced with 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 1, it is replaced with 4. But in Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 1, replaced with 4. In Example 2, the third row's fifth column is 2, replaced with 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it is 0, it is replaced with 4. But in Example 1, there are 0s in the input, and the output has 4s in some positions. But in the input's third row, the seventh column is 1, which is replaced with 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern in the positions of the 4s.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 4s are in the following positions:\n\nRow 2, column 6 (7th column) \u2192 4\n\nRow 4, column 6 (7th column) \u2192 4\n\nRow 6, column 4 (5th column) \u2192 3 (wait, no, in row 6, the output is 8 8 0 0 3 0 0 2 0 0. So column 4 is 3, column 7 is 2. So maybe not.\n\nWait, in row 5 of Example 1's output, the seventh column is 4.\n\nRow 5 of input is 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 \u2192 output is 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, no, the output for row 5 is 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0? No, the output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 5: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, the original input for row 5 is 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1. The output for row 5 is 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the seventh column (index 6) is 0, but in the input it was 0. So why is it 0 in the output? Maybe it's not replaced.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the seventh column of row 5 is 0, but in the input it was 0. So that's unchanged.\n\nWait, but in the output of Example 1, row 5's seventh column is 0. So that's not replaced. But in the output of Example 1, row 5's seventh column is 0. So maybe the transformation is not replacing 0s with 4.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s and 8s in the grid, and for each cell, the output is the number of 8s in the grid if it is in a certain position. For example, in Example 1, the number of 8s is 32. So if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it is replaced with 4.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are in the middle? For a 10x10 grid, the middle is around row 4-5, column 4-5. So maybe the cells in those positions are replaced with 4.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the third row (row 2) has a 4 in column 6. That's not in the middle. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8. For example, in Example 1, 32/8=4, so those cells are replaced with 4. But which cells?\n\nMaybe the cells that are in the same row or column as a 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to write a function that counts the number of 8s in the grid, and replaces certain cells with that count divided by 8, assuming that the cells are in the middle of the grid. But this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Count the number of 8s in the input grid.\n2. For each cell in the grid, if it is in the middle of the grid (e.g., rows 4-5 and columns 4-5), replace it with the count of 8s divided by 8.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it is a 0, replace it with the count of 8s divided by 8.\n\nBut in Example 1, the count is 32, so 4. So replace all 0s with 4. But in the input of Example 1, there are 0s, and in the output, some of them are replaced with 4. But in the output of Example 1, there are 0s as well. For example, in row 2 of the output, the seventh column is 4, but other 0s are unchanged.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern where certain cells are replaced with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8, and those cells are in certain positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. So, I'll proceed with the following code: count the number of 8s in the grid, and replace certain cells with that count divided by 8. For example, in Example 1, 32/8=4, and replace certain cells with 4.\n\nBut how to determine which cells? Maybe the cells that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in a 10x10 grid, the middle is rows 4-5 and columns 4-5. So, for each cell in those positions, replace with 4.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the third row (row 2) has a 4 in column 6. That's not in the middle. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with the cells that are 1 replaced with 4. In Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 1, replaced with 4. In Example 2, the third row's fifth column is 2, replaced with 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with the cells that are 0 replaced with 4. But in Example 1, there are 0s, and some of them are replaced with 4. But in the output of Example 1, there are still 0s.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it is 0, it is replaced with 4, and if it is 1, it is replaced with 4. But in Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 1, replaced with 4. In Example 2, the third row's fifth column is 2, replaced with 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with 4 based on their position. For example, the cells in the third row and seventh column are replaced with 4. But this is not a general pattern.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that replaces certain cells with 4 based on their position. For example, in the third row and seventh column, replace with 4. But this is not general.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with the cells that are in the third row and seventh column replaced with 4, and others replaced with 4 based on some other pattern. But this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation is to replace certain cells with 4 based on the number of 8s in the grid. For example, if the number of 8s is 32, then replace certain cells with 4. But how to determine which cells? Perhaps the cells that are in the middle of the grid.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\n- Count the number of 8s in the grid.\n- For each cell in the grid, if it is in the middle (rows 4-5, columns 4-5), replace it with 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    count_8 = sum(row.count(8) for row in grid)\n    # Replace certain cells with count_8 // 8\n    # For example, replace cells in the middle\n    new_grid = [row.copy() for row in grid]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if i in [4,5] and j in [4,5]:\n                new_grid[i][j] = count_8 // 8\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this is just a guess. In Example 1, count_8 is 32, so 32//8=4. So the middle cells are replaced with 4. But in the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 4, which is not in the middle. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps this is the best I can do given the time. So I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not match the examples perfectly.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, there are two examples given. Let me look at them closely.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 10x10. The input has some 8s and 0s, and the output has some changes. For instance, in the third row of the input, the third column is 0, and in the output, it's 0, but the seventh column changes from 1 to 4. Wait, maybe there's some kind of transformation based on the positions of certain numbers?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column changes from 1 to 4. Let me check other rows. In row 5 of the input, the seventh column is 0, but in the output, it's 4. Hmm, maybe it's related to the positions of 0s and 8s? Or maybe some kind of counting?\n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being replaced based on their neighbors. Let me check Example 2. The input has a lot of 8s and some other numbers. The output seems to have some numbers replaced. For example, in the third row of input, the fifth column is 2, and in the output, it's 4. Wait, but in the output of Example 2, the third row's fifth column is 4. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers are being replaced based on their position relative to other numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of distance or count of certain numbers in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have some numbers that are replaced with values that are higher. Let me check the first example again.\n\nIn the input of Example 1, the third row is 8 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. The output for that row is 8 8 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0. So the seventh column changes from 1 to 4. Similarly, in row 5 of the input, the seventh column is 0, but in the output, it's 4. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at row 7 of Example 1's input: 8 8 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0. The output is 8 8 0 0 3 0 0 2 0 0. So the fifth column changes from 1 to 3, and the eighth column changes from 1 to 2. Hmm, maybe these numbers are being replaced based on some count of surrounding cells?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the seventh column in the third row is 1, which becomes 4. Maybe that's related to the number of 0s in that row or column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being replaced with the sum of their neighbors. But that might be too complex.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a 4 in the first row, and the output has the same 4. The input has a 2 in the third row, fifth column, and the output has 4 there. Wait, maybe it's related to the number of 8s in the grid? Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have some numbers that are replaced with values that are higher. Let me check the first example again.\n\nIn the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 4. The input's third row's seventh column is 1. But in the input's third row, there's a 1 in the seventh column. Maybe that's a clue. Wait, in the input, the third row's seventh column is 1, but in the output, it's 4. Maybe that's because there are some other numbers in the grid that influence this cell. For example, maybe the number of 8s in the row or column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 0s in the row or column. For instance, in the third row of the input, there are several 0s. The seventh column is 1. But in the output, that cell becomes 4. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the third row of Example 1, the seventh column is 1, and in the output, it's 4. Maybe the position (row, column) is being used to calculate a value. For example, row 3 (0-based?), column 7 (0-based?), maybe 3 + 7 = 10, but that's not matching. Or maybe some other formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are being replaced with the number of times a certain value appears in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in some positions. Maybe that's the count of 8s in the grid. Let me check the input of Example 1. The input has a lot of 8s. For example, the first row is all 8s except for the first two elements. The second row is 3, 2, then 8s. The third row has 0s and a 1. So maybe the count of 8s in the grid is 8, but that's not matching the 4s in the output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of 0s and 8s. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in certain positions. Maybe those positions are where there are 0s in the input, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 4. The input's third row has a 1 there. Maybe that's because there are some other numbers in the grid that influence that cell. For example, maybe the number of 8s in that row or column. Let's check.\n\nIn the third row of the input, the row is 8 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. So there are 2 8s. The column 7 (assuming 0-based) for that row is 1. But the output is 4. Maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of times a certain value appears in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in some positions. Maybe that's the number of 0s in the grid. But that would be a lot.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid transformation where certain cells are being replaced based on their neighbors. For example, in Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 1, and in the output it's 4. Maybe that's the sum of the surrounding cells. Let's check the surrounding cells. The cell is in row 2 (assuming 0-based?), column 6. The surrounding cells would be up, down, left, right. Let's see:\n\nIn the input, row 2 (third row) is [8,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. So the cell at (2,6) is 1. The surrounding cells would be (1,6) which is 8, (3,6) which is 0, (2,5) which is 0, (2,7) which is 0. Sum is 8+0+0+0=8. But the output is 4. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the cells in the same row and column. For example, the row has 8,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0. The column 6 (assuming 0-based) is 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, maybe not. Maybe the sum of the row and column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 0s in the row and column. For example, in the third row of the input, there are 7 zeros. But that's not matching the 4 in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain positions are being replaced with the number of times a certain value appears in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in some positions. Maybe that's the count of 8s in the grid. Let me count the 8s in the input of Example 1.\n\nLooking at the input of Example 1:\n\nRow 0: 1 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 \u2192 8 8s (positions 2-9)\nRow 1: 3 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 \u2192 8 8s (positions 2-9)\nRow 2: 8 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nRow 3: 8 8 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nRow 4: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nRow 5: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nRow 6: 8 8 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nRow 7: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nRow 8: 8 8 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nRow 9: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \u2192 2 8s (positions 0,1)\nTotal 8s: Let's count. Rows 0 and 1 have 8 each (8*2=16). Rows 2-9 have 2 each, that's 8 rows * 2 = 16. Total 32 8s. So if the output has 4 in some positions, maybe that's the count divided by something. 32/8=4. So maybe the output is replacing certain cells with the total count of 8s divided by 8? But that's just a guess.\n\nIn the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 4. Which is 32/8=4. Maybe that's the case. But then why would that be the case? Maybe the transformation is that for certain cells, they are replaced with the total number of 8s in the grid divided by 8. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced with the number of 8s in the grid. For example, if the total number of 8s is 32, then maybe some cells are replaced with 32. But in the output, it's 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the cells that are 0 in the input are being replaced with the number of 8s in the grid divided by something. But that seems too vague.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. Let's see. The input of Example 2 has a row that starts with 8s and ends with 4, 6. The output has the same 4 and 6. But in the third row of input, the fifth column is 2, and in the output, it's 4. Maybe that's because there are more 8s in the grid? Let's count the 8s in Example 2's input.\n\nThe input of Example 2 is a 12x12 grid. Wait, the input for Example 2 is 12 rows, each with 12 elements. But the output is 12x12 as well. But the test input is 12x12 as well. Wait, but the problem says that the test input is 12x12? Wait, the test input is given as 12 rows, each with 12 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 10x10. Wait, no, the problem says that the function must return a 10x10 grid. Wait, the training examples have 10x10 grids. But the test input is 12x12? That seems conflicting. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the test input is shown as:\n\nTest Input:\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n...\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 3 1\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 7 4\n\nSo that's 12 rows, each with 14 elements. Wait, but the problem says that the output must be 10x10. That's confusing. But the problem says that the function must take a 2D list (grid) and return a 10x10 grid. So maybe the test input is for a different problem? Or perhaps there's a mistake. But the training examples are 10x10. So the function must take a grid of any size and return a 10x10 grid? Or perhaps the test input is part of the problem, but the function is supposed to handle 10x10 grids. Maybe the test input is for a different purpose, but the function is supposed to take a 10x10 grid and return a 10x10 grid. So the training examples are 10x10, and the test input is 12x12, but the function is supposed to process 10x10 grids. So perhaps the test input is not part of the training examples, but the function is supposed to take a 10x10 grid and return a 10x10 grid.\n\nBut that's not clear. However, the problem says that the function must return a 10x10 grid. So regardless of the input size, the output must be 10x10. But in the training examples, the input is 10x10, and the output is 10x10. So for the function, the input is a 10x10 grid, and the output is also 10x10.\n\nSo, back to the training examples. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 4 in some positions. Let me think about the positions where the output changes. For instance, in the third row of the input, the seventh column is 1. In the output, it's 4. Also, in row 5 of the input, the seventh column is 0, and in the output, it's 4. Maybe that's because those positions are in certain regions of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 0s in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the input has a certain number of 0s, and the output replaces some cells with that count divided by something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in positions where there are 0s in the input. But in the third row, the seventh column is 1 in the input, but it's 4 in the output. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where the number in the output is the sum of the numbers in the same row and column. For example, in the third row of the input, the seventh column is 1. The sum of the row is 8+8+0+0+0+0+1+0+0+0 = 17. The column 7 (assuming 0-based) has values: row 0:8, row1:8, row2:0, row3:0, row4:1, row5:0, row6:1, row7:1, row8:0, row9:0. Sum is 8+8+0+0+1+0+1+1+0+0 = 19. So sum of row and column is 17+19=36. Not sure how that would relate to 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing certain cells with the number of times a certain value appears in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in some positions. Maybe that's the count of 8s in the grid divided by 8 (32/8=4). But why would that be the case?\n\nIf that's the case, then in Example 1, the output replaces certain cells with 4, which is 32/8. But in Example 2, what's the count of 8s? Let's see:\n\nIn Example 2's input, the first row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 6. So 10 8s. Then the second row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 2 \u2192 10 8s. Third row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Fourth row: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Fifth row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Sixth row: 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 8 8 \u2192 4 8s. Seventh row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Eighth row: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Ninth row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Tenth row: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Eleventh row: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. Twelfth row: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 8 8 \u2192 2 8s. \n\nAdding up all the 8s: \n\nRows 0 and 1: 10 each \u2192 20. \n\nRow 2: 2 \u2192 total 22. \n\nRow 3: 2 \u2192 24. \n\nRow 4: 2 \u2192 26. \n\nRow 5: 4 \u2192 30. \n\nRow 6: 2 \u2192 32. \n\nRow 7: 2 \u2192 34. \n\nRow 8: 2 \u2192 36. \n\nRow 9: 2 \u2192 38. \n\nRow 10: 2 \u2192 40. \n\nRow 11: 2 \u2192 42. \n\nSo total 42 8s. \n\nIn the output of Example 2, the third row's fifth column is 4. 42 divided by 10.5 is 4. But that's not an integer. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the count of 8s is 42, and in the output, some positions are replaced with 4. Maybe that's because 42 divided by something. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is replacing certain cells with the number of 8s in the grid. But that would mean that in Example 1, the output has 4 in some positions, which is 32/8. But 32 is the count of 8s in Example 1. So 32 divided by 8 is 4. Maybe that's the pattern. So in Example 1, the output replaces certain cells with the total count of 8s divided by 8. But why 8?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is replacing certain cells with the number of 8s in the grid divided by the number of rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, 32 / 10 = 3.2, but the output has 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 1 in the seventh column, which is replaced with 4. Maybe that's because there are 4 zeros in the grid. Let's count the number of zeros in Example 1's input. \n\nLooking at the input of Example 1:\n\nRow 0: 1 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 \u2192 no zeros.\n\nRow 1: 3 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 \u2192 no zeros.\n\nRow 2: 8 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 \u2192 5 zeros.\n\nRow 3: 8 8 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 5 zeros.\n\nRow 4: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 \u2192 4 zeros.\n\nRow 5: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 6 zeros.\n\nRow 6: 8 8 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 4 zeros.\n\nRow 7: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 4 zeros.\n\nRow 8: 8 8 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 \u2192 4 zeros.\n\nRow 9: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \u2192 5 zeros.\n\nTotal zeros: 5+5+4+6+4+4+4+5 = 37? Let me recount:\n\nRow 2: 5 zeros (positions 2-5, 7-9 \u2192 5 zeros? Or positions 2,3,4,5,7,8,9 \u2192 7 zeros? Wait, row 2 is [8,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. So positions 2,3,4,5,7,8,9 \u2192 7 zeros. So row 2 has 7 zeros.\n\nRow 3: [8,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So positions 2,4,5,6,7,8,9 \u2192 7 zeros.\n\nRow 4: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1]. Positions 2,3,4,5,6,8 \u2192 6 zeros.\n\nRow 5: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 7 zeros.\n\nRow 6: [8,8,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 positions 2,3,5,6,8,9 \u2192 6 zeros.\n\nRow 7: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0] \u2192 positions 2,3,4,5,6,8,9 \u2192 7 zeros.\n\nRow 8: [8,8,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0] \u2192 positions 2,4,5,8,9 \u2192 5 zeros.\n\nRow 9: [8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] \u2192 positions 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 \u2192 7 zeros.\n\nSo total zeros:\n\nRow 2:7, row3:7, row4:6, row5:7, row6:6, row7:7, row8:5, row9:7 \u2192 sum is 7+7=14, +6=20, +7=27, +6=33, +7=40, +5=45, +7=52. So total 52 zeros.\n\nIn the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 4. 52 divided by 13 is 4. But why 13? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of zeros is 52, and the output replaces certain cells with the number of zeros divided by something. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that cells with 0 in the input are replaced with the number of 8s in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 1, which is not zero. But in the output, it's 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s and 8s in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 1 in the seventh column, which is replaced with 4. Maybe that's because the seventh column has a certain number of 8s. Let's check the seventh column (index 6, assuming 0-based) in the input of Example 1:\n\nRow 0: 8\n\nRow 1: 8\n\nRow 2: 1\n\nRow 3: 0\n\nRow 4: 0\n\nRow 5: 0\n\nRow 6: 0\n\nRow 7: 1\n\nRow 8: 1\n\nRow 9: 0\n\nSo the seventh column has values: 8,8,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0. The sum is 8+8+1+0+0+0+0+1+1+0 = 19. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain cells, the output is the number of times a certain value appears in the row or column. For example, in the third row of Example 1, the seventh column is 1, and in the output it's 4. Maybe the number of 0s in that row is 7, and the output is 7-3=4? Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern in the positions where the numbers change.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the third row has 4 in the seventh column. The seventh column in the input was 1. In row 5 of the input, the seventh column is 0, and in the output it's 4. In row 7 of the input, the fifth column is 1, and in the output it's 3. In row 8 of the input, the fourth column is 1, and in the output it's 3. \n\nLooking at these positions, maybe they are in certain regions of the grid. For example, the seventh column in rows 2, 5, 7, etc. Maybe those are positions where there are certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s. For example, in the input, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with a certain value based on its position. But in the input, the third row's seventh column is 1, which is replaced with 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 8s in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the number of 8s is 32. So 32 divided by 8 is 4. So maybe the output replaces certain cells with 4. But why 8? It's possible that the transformation is that certain cells are replaced with the total number of 8s in the grid divided by 8, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is replacing certain cells with the number of 8s in the grid, but only for certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in certain positions, and the total number of 8s is 32. So 32/8=4. So maybe the cells that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 4.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are being replaced? Maybe the cells that are in certain positions, like the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's a 0, it's replaced with the number of 8s in the grid divided by something. But again, this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s and 8s in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 1, which is replaced with 4. Maybe that's because the cell is in a certain position where there are 4 8s in the row or column.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern where certain cells are replaced with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8, or some similar calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's 0, it's replaced with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8. But in Example 1, the output has 4 in some positions, which is 32/8=4. So if the cell is 0, it's replaced with 4. But in the input, the third row's seventh column is 1, not 0, so it's not replaced. But in the output, it's 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8, regardless of their value. But that would mean that all cells are replaced with 4 in Example 1, which is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 8s in the grid and the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with 4. But how to determine that?\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should think of other patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in certain positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, the third row's seventh column is in the middle of the grid (since it's 10x10). Maybe the transformation is that certain cells in the middle are replaced with 4, but this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where the cells that are 0 in the input are replaced with 4, and other cells are unchanged. But in the input of Example 1, there are 0s, and the output has 4s in some positions. But in the input's third row, the seventh column is 1, which is replaced with 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, except for certain cells where the value is replaced with the number of 8s in the grid. But in Example 1, that would mean that all cells are replaced with 4, which is not the case.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's look at the outputs of the two examples and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 4 in certain positions. In Example 2, the output has 4 in certain positions as well. For example, in Example 2's output, the third row's fifth column is 4, which was 2 in the input. So maybe that's because the number of 8s in the grid is 42, and 42 divided by 10.5 is 4, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 8s in the grid, and for each cell, if it's in a certain position, it's replaced with the number of 8s divided by some value. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s and 8s in the grid, and for each cell, the output is the number of 8s in the grid if the cell is 0, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with 4. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it's a 0, it's replaced with the number of 8s in the grid. But in Example 1, the number of 8s is 32, so 32 would be the value for those cells. But in the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 4, not 32. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with some cells replaced with 4 based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain cells are replaced with 4. But how to determine which cells?\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Let's think of the following hypothesis: the transformation replaces certain cells with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8, and those cells are those that are in the middle of the grid.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the number of 8s is 32. 32/8 = 4. So those cells that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 4.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are in the middle? For a 10x10 grid, the middle would be around row 4-5, column 4-5. But in the output of Example 1, the third row (row 2) has a 4 in column 6 (assuming 0-based). That's not in the middle. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cells that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 4. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with 4 if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the third row's seventh column is replaced with 4. Maybe that's because it's in a certain position.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 in the seventh column of row 2, and in row 5, column 6. Maybe those are positions where there are 0s in the input. But in row 2, column 6 is 1, not 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with the number of 8s in the row or column. For example, in row 2 of Example 1, the seventh column is 1. The number of 8s in that row is 2. But the output is 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with the number of 8s in the row. For example, in row 2 of Example 1, there are 2 8s. But the output is 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with the number of 8s in the column. For example, in column 6 of Example 1, the number of 8s is 8 (row 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9? Wait, column 6 in Example 1's input is:\n\nRow 0: 8\n\nRow 1: 8\n\nRow 2: 1\n\nRow 3: 0\n\nRow 4: 0\n\nRow 5: 0\n\nRow 6: 0\n\nRow 7: 1\n\nRow 8: 1\n\nRow 9: 0\n\nSo the number of 8s in column 6 is 2 (rows 0 and 1). So 2, but the output is 4. Not matching.\n\nThis is very challenging. Given the time I have, perhaps I should proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is replacing certain cells with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8, and those cells are in certain positions.\n\nSo, for example, in Example 1, the number of 8s is 32. 32/8=4. So the output replaces certain cells with 4. But which cells?\n\nMaybe the cells that are in the middle of the grid. For example, the middle of the grid is around row 4-5, column 4-5. But in the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 4. That's not in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cells that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 4. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with 4 if they are in the same row or column as a 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with 4 based on the number of 0s in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the number of 0s is 52. 52 divided by 13 is 4. So maybe the cells that are in the middle are replaced with 4.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation replaces certain cells with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8, and those cells are in positions where the original value is 1. For example, in Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 1, which is replaced with 4. In Example 2, the third row's fifth column is 2, which is replaced with 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 1, it is replaced with 4. But in Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 1, replaced with 4. In Example 2, the third row's fifth column is 2, replaced with 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it is 0, it is replaced with 4. But in Example 1, there are 0s in the input, and the output has 4s in some positions. But in the input's third row, the seventh column is 1, which is replaced with 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern in the positions of the 4s.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 4s are in the following positions:\n\nRow 2, column 6 (7th column) \u2192 4\n\nRow 4, column 6 (7th column) \u2192 4\n\nRow 6, column 4 (5th column) \u2192 3 (wait, no, in row 6, the output is 8 8 0 0 3 0 0 2 0 0. So column 4 is 3, column 7 is 2. So maybe not.\n\nWait, in row 5 of Example 1's output, the seventh column is 4.\n\nRow 5 of input is 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 \u2192 output is 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, no, the output for row 5 is 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0? No, the output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 5: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, the original input for row 5 is 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1. The output for row 5 is 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the seventh column (index 6) is 0, but in the input it was 0. So why is it 0 in the output? Maybe it's not replaced.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the seventh column of row 5 is 0, but in the input it was 0. So that's unchanged.\n\nWait, but in the output of Example 1, row 5's seventh column is 0. So that's not replaced. But in the output of Example 1, row 5's seventh column is 0. So maybe the transformation is not replacing 0s with 4.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s and 8s in the grid, and for each cell, the output is the number of 8s in the grid if it is in a certain position. For example, in Example 1, the number of 8s is 32. So if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it is replaced with 4.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are in the middle? For a 10x10 grid, the middle is around row 4-5, column 4-5. So maybe the cells in those positions are replaced with 4.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the third row (row 2) has a 4 in column 6. That's not in the middle. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8. For example, in Example 1, 32/8=4, so those cells are replaced with 4. But which cells?\n\nMaybe the cells that are in the same row or column as a 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to write a function that counts the number of 8s in the grid, and replaces certain cells with that count divided by 8, assuming that the cells are in the middle of the grid. But this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Count the number of 8s in the input grid.\n2. For each cell in the grid, if it is in the middle of the grid (e.g., rows 4-5 and columns 4-5), replace it with the count of 8s divided by 8.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it is a 0, replace it with the count of 8s divided by 8.\n\nBut in Example 1, the count is 32, so 4. So replace all 0s with 4. But in the input of Example 1, there are 0s, and in the output, some of them are replaced with 4. But in the output of Example 1, there are 0s as well. For example, in row 2 of the output, the seventh column is 4, but other 0s are unchanged.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern where certain cells are replaced with the number of 8s in the grid divided by 8, and those cells are in certain positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. So, I'll proceed with the following code: count the number of 8s in the grid, and replace certain cells with that count divided by 8. For example, in Example 1, 32/8=4, and replace certain cells with 4.\n\nBut how to determine which cells? Maybe the cells that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in a 10x10 grid, the middle is rows 4-5 and columns 4-5. So, for each cell in those positions, replace with 4.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the third row (row 2) has a 4 in column 6. That's not in the middle. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with the cells that are 1 replaced with 4. In Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 1, replaced with 4. In Example 2, the third row's fifth column is 2, replaced with 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with the cells that are 0 replaced with 4. But in Example 1, there are 0s, and some of them are replaced with 4. But in the output of Example 1, there are still 0s.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it is 0, it is replaced with 4, and if it is 1, it is replaced with 4. But in Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 1, replaced with 4. In Example 2, the third row's fifth column is 2, replaced with 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced with 4 based on their position. For example, the cells in the third row and seventh column are replaced with 4. But this is not a general pattern.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that replaces certain cells with 4 based on their position. For example, in the third row and seventh column, replace with 4. But this is not general.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with the cells that are in the third row and seventh column replaced with 4, and others replaced with 4 based on some other pattern. But this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation is to replace certain cells with 4 based on the number of 8s in the grid. For example, if the number of 8s is 32, then replace certain cells with 4. But how to determine which cells? Perhaps the cells that are in the middle of the grid.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\n- Count the number of 8s in the grid.\n- For each cell in the grid, if it is in the middle (rows 4-5, columns 4-5), replace it with 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    count_8 = sum(row.count(8) for row in grid)\n    # Replace certain cells with count_8 // 8\n    # For example, replace cells in the middle\n    new_grid = [row.copy() for row in grid]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if i in [4,5] and j in [4,5]:\n                new_grid[i][j] = count_8 // 8\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this is just a guess. In Example 1, count_8 is 32, so 32//8=4. So the middle cells are replaced with 4. But in the output of Example 1, the third row's seventh column is 4, which is not in the middle. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps this is the best I can do given the time. So I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not match the examples perfectly.\n"
