The input grid is always 3 rows high and 3 columns wide. This suggests that the output is a transformation of the input that expands it vertically.\n\nLooking at the examples more closely:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n1 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 1 1\n1 1 0\n\nThe output seems to be the input repeated in a specific pattern. The first three rows are the same as the input, and the last three rows appear to be a mirrored version of the input.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 1\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0\n1 0 1\n1 1 0\n1 1 0\n1 0 1\n0 0 0\n\nThis also seems to be the input repeated with a mirrored version.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n0 0 1\n0 0 1\n0 0 1\n0 0 0\n\nThis pattern also seems to be the input repeated with a mirrored version.\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation is to repeat the input grid vertically, with the last three rows being a mirrored version of the input.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new grid with 6 rows\n    transformed_grid = []\n    \n    # Add the original input grid as the first 3 rows\n    for row in grid:\n        transformed_grid.append(row)\n    \n    # Add a mirrored version of the input grid as the last 3 rows\n    for row in reversed(grid):\n        transformed_grid.append(row)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
