          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a lot of 0s and 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. The output seems to have some changes where certain numbers are replaced or modified. For instance, in the input, there's a 1 in some positions, and in the output, they might be turned into 2s or 3s. Also, there are regions where numbers are spread out or connected.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 0s, 1s, 3s, 4s, and the output changes some of these. For example, a 3 in the input becomes a 3 in the output, but other numbers like 1s might be replaced with higher numbers. Also, there's a 4 in the input that becomes a 4 in the output, but other parts might have changes.\n\nIn Example 3, there's a 4 that becomes a 4, but other numbers like 6 are present. The output has some numbers that are increased, like 1s turning into 4s or 6s. Also, there's a 6 in the input that becomes a 6 in the output. \n\nLooking at the outputs, it seems that numbers might be replaced based on their position or surrounding values. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where there were 1s. Maybe the transformation involves replacing numbers with higher numbers based on their neighbors or some pattern.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that in some examples, numbers are replaced with higher numbers in certain regions. For instance, in Example 3, the input has a 4 that becomes a 4 in the output, but other numbers like 1s turn into 4s or 6s. Maybe the transformation is related to the number of adjacent cells with certain values. \n\nWait, looking at Example 3's input and output: there's a 4 in the input that becomes a 4 in the output. But in another part, there's a 1 that becomes a 4. Also, there's a 6 in the input that becomes a 6 in the output. So maybe numbers are replaced based on their position in a grid. For example, numbers in certain regions are increased, while others remain the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers with higher values if they are part of a certain shape or pattern. For example, if a cell is part of a connected region of 1s, it might be replaced with a higher number. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output: the output has more 2s and 3s. For example, in the input, there's a 1 in the middle, and in the output, it's replaced with 2 or 3. Maybe the transformation is to increase numbers based on their position relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is in a certain position (like in a cross shape), it's replaced with a higher number.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output seems to have numbers that are higher than the input in certain areas. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 1 in some positions, and the output has 2s or 3s. Maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are part of a specific pattern, like a cross or a line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers based on their position in a grid. For example, numbers in certain rows or columns are increased. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 3, there's a 6 in the input that becomes a 6 in the output. But in other parts, numbers are replaced with higher values. So maybe the transformation is to increase numbers if they are in certain positions, like in the middle of a region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the maximum value in their surrounding cells. But that might not be the case. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 1 in some positions, and the output has 2s. But the surrounding cells might have higher numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of adjacent cells with certain values. For example, if a cell has multiple adjacent 1s, it's replaced with a higher number.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the outputs, there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced with higher numbers in regions that are connected. For example, in Example 1, there's a region of 1s that becomes 2s and 3s. Maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are part of a connected region of a certain number.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the transformation is to replace each number with the maximum value in its connected region. However, that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers based on their position in a grid. For example, numbers in certain positions (like the center) are increased. But that would require knowing the exact positions, which might not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, which is the third example, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values in certain regions. For example, in the test input, there's a 1 that becomes a 6 in the output. So perhaps the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with their value plus some function based on their position. But that's too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where the input had 1s. In Example 2, the output has 3s and 4s where the input had 1s. In Example 3, there's a 4 that becomes a 4, but other numbers are replaced. So maybe the transformation is to increase numbers in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are part of a certain shape. For example, if a cell is part of a cross or a line, it's replaced with a higher number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the next higher number in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 1s become 2s and 3s. But how to determine which ones?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the number of adjacent cells that are non-zero. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the input that becomes a 4 in the output. But in other parts, numbers are increased. So maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are in a certain region, but leave some numbers as they are.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace numbers with the maximum value in their row or column. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of their neighbors. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a higher number, it becomes that higher number.\n\nBut how to code this? Maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the maximum value in its surrounding cells. However, that would require checking all surrounding cells and taking the maximum. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, cells in the center are replaced with higher numbers.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the number of adjacent cells that are non-zero. For example, if a cell has multiple adjacent non-zero cells, it becomes a higher number.\n\nBut how to determine that. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 1 in a position where there are multiple adjacent 1s. The output replaces it with a 2 or 3. Maybe the count of adjacent non-zero cells is used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the number of adjacent cells that are non-zero. For example, if a cell has three adjacent non-zero cells, it becomes 3.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's test this idea against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row is all 0s. So the output is all 0s. That fits. In the second row, there are 1s and 0s. The output has 1s and 2s. For example, the cell in row 1, column 2 (assuming 0-based) is 1. Its adjacent cells might have 1s, so maybe the count is 3, leading to 3. But the output has 2s. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the number of adjacent cells that are non-zero. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the number of adjacent cells that are higher than them. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where the input had 1s. In Example 2, the output has 3s and 4s where the input had 1s. In Example 3, the output has 4s and 6s where the input had 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the next higher number in certain regions.\n\nBut how to determine which regions? Maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are part of a certain shape, like a cross or a line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of their position. For example, cells in certain positions (like the center) are increased. But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right or below. But that would require checking adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where the input had 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 2s or 3s based on their position.\n\nBut how to code this? Maybe the transformation is to replace each 1 with 2 if it's part of a certain shape, and 3 otherwise. But without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right. But that would not fit all examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the test input and output. The test input has a 1 in some positions, and the output has a 6 in some positions. So maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a higher number.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the maximum value in their row or column. For example, if a cell's row has a 3, it becomes 3. But this would not explain the changes in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the left or above. For example, if a cell is to the right of a higher number, it becomes that higher number. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where the input had 1s. In the input, there are regions where 1s are connected. For example, in the input, there's a cross shape of 1s. In the output, those 1s are replaced with 2s and 3s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 2s or 3s if they are part of a connected region of 1s.\n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are part of a connected region of a certain number. For example, if a cell is part of a connected region of 1s, replace it with 2. If it's part of a larger region, replace with 3.\n\nBut how to implement this. It would require connected component analysis. For example, find connected regions of the same number and replace them with higher numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each number with the next higher number if it's part of a certain shape. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the number of connected regions they are part of. For example, if a cell is part of a region with multiple connected cells, replace it with a higher number.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, cells in the middle are replaced with higher numbers.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, the numbers seem to be increased in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where the input had 1s. In Example 2, the output has 3s and 4s where the input had 1s. In Example 3, the output has 4s and 6s where the input had 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values based on their position in the grid.\n\nBut how to determine which positions. Maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with a higher number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right. For example, if a cell is to the left of a higher number, it becomes that higher number. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if a cell is in a row where there's a higher number, it becomes that number.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make a hypothesis. Let's think about the following: in the examples, numbers are replaced with higher values in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where the input had 1s. This suggests that the transformation might involve replacing numbers with higher values based on their position or neighboring cells.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the transformation replaces numbers with the maximum value in their row or column. For example, if a cell is in a row where the maximum is 3, it becomes 3. But this would not explain the changes in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right. For example, if a cell is to the left of a higher number, it becomes that higher number. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation might be to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right, but if that's not possible, then the cell below. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right if it's higher. But this would require checking each cell.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll try to think of a possible transformation that could fit the examples. Let's consider that the transformation replaces numbers with higher values based on their position in the grid. For example, numbers in the center are replaced with higher values, and numbers in the corners remain the same.\n\nBut how to implement this. Perhaps the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the center, replace it with a higher value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right. For example, if the cell to the right is higher, replace it with that value.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if a cell is in a row where there's a higher number, replace it with that higher number.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with a possible hypothesis: the transformation replaces each number with the maximum value in its row or column. For example, for each cell, find the maximum value in its row and column and replace the cell with that maximum. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right, but if that's not possible, then the cell below. This is similar to a flood fill algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation might be to replace numbers with the value of the cell in the same row, but only if it's higher. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all 0s. The second row has 0s and 1s, and the output has 0s and 1s. So maybe the transformation is to leave 0s as 0s, and replace other numbers with higher values based on their position.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are part of a certain shape. For example, if a cell is part of a cross shape, it's replaced with a higher number.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right. For example, if the cell to the right is higher, replace it with that value. Otherwise, leave it as is. This would require checking each cell's right neighbor.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 1 in the second row. The cell to the right might be 1, so it would remain 1. But the output has 2s and 3s. So this hypothesis might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right if it's higher. For example, if the cell to the right is higher, replace it with that value. Otherwise, replace it with the cell below. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll try to write a function that replaces numbers with higher values based on their position. For example, in the output, numbers are increased in certain regions. Maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right if it's higher, otherwise the cell below.\n\nBut without more examples, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right. For example, if the cell to the right is 1, replace it with 1. But this would not change anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right, but if that's not possible, then the cell below. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, there are regions where numbers are replaced with higher values. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where the input had 1s. This might suggest that the transformation is to replace 1s with 2s or 3s if they are part of a certain shape.\n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are part of a connected region of a certain number.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. For each cell, determine if it is part of a connected region of a certain number.\n2. Replace the number with a higher value based on the size or shape of the region.\n\nBut how to implement this. For example, for each cell, check if it is part of a connected region of 1s, and if so, replace it with 2 or 3 based on the size of the region.\n\nBut this requires connected component analysis.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each cell, find the connected component of the same number.\n- Replace the number with a higher value based on the size of the component or other factors.\n\nBut how to determine the higher value. For example, in Example 1, the component of 1s is replaced with 2s and 3s. Maybe the size of the component determines the replacement value. For example, if the component has more than 5 cells, replace with 3, otherwise with 2.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each number with the next higher number if it is part of a connected region of the same number.\n\nBut this would require checking connected components.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- For each cell, find connected components of the same value.\n- Replace the value with a higher number based on the component's properties.\n\nBut how to determine the replacement value. For example, in Example 1, the component of 1s is replaced with 2s and 3s. Maybe the replacement value is based on the component's size. For example, if the component has more than 5 cells, replace with 3, otherwise with 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement value could be the number of cells in the component. For example, a component with 3 cells becomes 3.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has a 1 in a region that becomes 2 or 3. So this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement value is the number of cells in the component plus 1. For example, a component of size 2 becomes 3.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this hypothesis: the transformation replaces each number with the next higher number if it is part of a connected region of the same number. For example, if a cell is part of a connected region of 1s, replace it with 2. If it's part of a larger region, replace with 3.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's think about how to code this.\n\nFirst, we need to find connected components of the same value. Then, for each component, replace all its cells with a higher value. But how to choose the higher value.\n\nAlternatively, the higher value could be the value of the component plus 1. For example, if a component is of value 1, replace with 2. If it's of value 2, replace with 3, etc. But this would not explain the examples where numbers are replaced with higher values like 3 or 4.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 1s that become 2s and 3s. So maybe the replacement value is based on the component's size. For example, if the component is large, replace with a higher value.\n\nBut without more information, this is hard to code.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right. For example, if the cell to the right is higher, replace it with that value. Otherwise, replace it with the cell below.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right, but if that's not possible, then the cell below. This would require checking each cell's right and below neighbors.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to code a function that replaces numbers with higher values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, replace it with a higher value.\n\nBut this is not a solid approach.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right, but if it's 0, then leave it as is. But this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation replaces each number with the next higher number if it is part of a connected region of the same number. For example, if a cell is part of a connected region of 1s, replace it with 2. If it's part of a larger region, replace it with 3.\n\nSo, the code would involve:\n\n1. Find all connected components of the same value.\n2. For each component, replace all its cells with the value + 1.\n\nBut this might not fit the examples, but it's a start.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a region of 1s. If we replace them with 2, then in the output, those 1s become 2s. But in the output, some of them are 3s. So this might not fit.\n\nBut maybe the replacement is to replace with the value +1 if the component is of a certain size.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is to replace with the value +1 for all components.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s. So this might not fit.\n\nAnother possible approach: the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right if it's higher. Otherwise, replace with the cell below. But this would require checking each cell.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to write a function that replaces numbers with the value of the cell to the right. If the cell to the right is higher, replace it with that value. Otherwise, replace with the cell below. If both are not possible, leave it as is.\n\nBut this is a guess. Let's code this.\n\nThe code would look like:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*30 for _ in range(30)]\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if j+1 < 30:\n                right = grid[i][j+1]\n            else:\n                right = 0\n            if i+1 < 30:\n                below = grid[i+1][j]\n            else:\n                below = 0\n            if right > grid[i][j]:\n                transformed[i][j] = right\n            elif below > grid[i][j]:\n                transformed[i][j] = below\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see if this fits the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 1 in the second row, and the cell to the right is 1, so it would remain 1. But the output has 2s. So this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the maximum of the cell to the right and below. But this would not explain the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace numbers with the maximum of the cell to the right and below, but if that's not possible, leave it as is.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it might not fit the examples perfectly. The code would be:\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right, but if it's 0, then replace with the cell below.\n\nBut again, this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace each number with the value of the cell to the right, but if that's 0, then replace with the cell below. If both are 0, leave it as is.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces each number with the maximum of the cell to the right and below. If that's not possible, leave it as is.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*30 for _ in range(30)]\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            max_val = grid[i][j]\n            if j+1 < 30:\n                max_val = max(max_val, grid[i][j+1])\n            if i+1 < 30:\n                max_val = max(max_val, grid[i+1][j])\n            transformed[i][j] = max_val\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace each cell with the maximum of itself, right, and below. However, this might not fit the examples, but it's a possible approach.\n\nTesting this with Example 1: the first row is all 0s. So the transformed grid would be all 0s. The second row has 0s and 1s. For example, the cell at (1,0) would have max(0, 0, 0) = 0. The cell at (1,1) would have max(1, 1, 0) = 1. But the output has 2s and 3s. So this might not fit.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it might not be correct. The code would be:\n\nBut wait, in the examples, the output has higher numbers than the input. So this approach might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the maximum of the cell to the right and below, but if that's higher than the current value, replace it. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut this is what the code above does.\n\nBut this might not fit the examples, but it's the best I can think of.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the value of the cell to the right, but if it's not possible, then the cell below. If both are not possible, leave it as is.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll proceed with the code that replaces each cell with the maximum of the cell to the right and below. This is a possible approach, even if it might not fit the examples perfectly.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a lot of 0s and 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. The output seems to have some changes where certain numbers are replaced or modified. For instance, in the input, there's a 1 in some positions, and in the output, they might be turned into 2s or 3s. Also, there are regions where numbers are spread out or connected.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 0s, 1s, 3s, 4s, and the output changes some of these. For example, a 3 in the input becomes a 3 in the output, but other numbers like 1s might be replaced with higher numbers. Also, there's a 4 in the input that becomes a 4 in the output, but other parts might have changes.\n\nIn Example 3, there's a 4 that becomes a 4, but other numbers like 6 are present. The output has some numbers that are increased, like 1s turning into 4s or 6s. Also, there's a 6 in the input that becomes a 6 in the output. \n\nLooking at the outputs, it seems that numbers might be replaced based on their position or surrounding values. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where there were 1s. Maybe the transformation involves replacing numbers with higher numbers based on their neighbors or some pattern.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that in some examples, numbers are replaced with higher numbers in certain regions. For instance, in Example 3, the input has a 4 that becomes a 4 in the output, but other numbers like 1s turn into 4s or 6s. Maybe the transformation is related to the number of adjacent cells with certain values. \n\nWait, looking at Example 3's input and output: there's a 4 in the input that becomes a 4 in the output. But in another part, there's a 1 that becomes a 4. Also, there's a 6 in the input that becomes a 6 in the output. So maybe numbers are replaced based on their position in a grid. For example, numbers in certain regions are increased, while others remain the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers with higher values if they are part of a certain shape or pattern. For example, if a cell is part of a connected region of 1s, it might be replaced with a higher number. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output: the output has more 2s and 3s. For example, in the input, there's a 1 in the middle, and in the output, it's replaced with 2 or 3. Maybe the transformation is to increase numbers based on their position relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is in a certain position (like in a cross shape), it's replaced with a higher number.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the output seems to have numbers that are higher than the input in certain areas. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 1 in some positions, and the output has 2s or 3s. Maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are part of a specific pattern, like a cross or a line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers based on their position in a grid. For example, numbers in certain rows or columns are increased. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 3, there's a 6 in the input that becomes a 6 in the output. But in other parts, numbers are replaced with higher values. So maybe the transformation is to increase numbers if they are in certain positions, like in the middle of a region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the maximum value in their surrounding cells. But that might not be the case. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 1 in some positions, and the output has 2s. But the surrounding cells might have higher numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of adjacent cells with certain values. For example, if a cell has multiple adjacent 1s, it's replaced with a higher number.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the outputs, there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced with higher numbers in regions that are connected. For example, in Example 1, there's a region of 1s that becomes 2s and 3s. Maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are part of a connected region of a certain number.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the transformation is to replace each number with the maximum value in its connected region. However, that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers based on their position in a grid. For example, numbers in certain positions (like the center) are increased. But that would require knowing the exact positions, which might not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, which is the third example, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values in certain regions. For example, in the test input, there's a 1 that becomes a 6 in the output. So perhaps the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with their value plus some function based on their position. But that's too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where the input had 1s. In Example 2, the output has 3s and 4s where the input had 1s. In Example 3, there's a 4 that becomes a 4, but other numbers are replaced. So maybe the transformation is to increase numbers in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are part of a certain shape. For example, if a cell is part of a cross or a line, it's replaced with a higher number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the next higher number in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 1s become 2s and 3s. But how to determine which ones?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the number of adjacent cells that are non-zero. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the input that becomes a 4 in the output. But in other parts, numbers are increased. So maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are in a certain region, but leave some numbers as they are.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace numbers with the maximum value in their row or column. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of their neighbors. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a higher number, it becomes that higher number.\n\nBut how to code this? Maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the maximum value in its surrounding cells. However, that would require checking all surrounding cells and taking the maximum. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, cells in the center are replaced with higher numbers.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the number of adjacent cells that are non-zero. For example, if a cell has multiple adjacent non-zero cells, it becomes a higher number.\n\nBut how to determine that. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 1 in a position where there are multiple adjacent 1s. The output replaces it with a 2 or 3. Maybe the count of adjacent non-zero cells is used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the number of adjacent cells that are non-zero. For example, if a cell has three adjacent non-zero cells, it becomes 3.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's test this idea against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row is all 0s. So the output is all 0s. That fits. In the second row, there are 1s and 0s. The output has 1s and 2s. For example, the cell in row 1, column 2 (assuming 0-based) is 1. Its adjacent cells might have 1s, so maybe the count is 3, leading to 3. But the output has 2s. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the number of adjacent cells that are non-zero. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the number of adjacent cells that are higher than them. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where the input had 1s. In Example 2, the output has 3s and 4s where the input had 1s. In Example 3, the output has 4s and 6s where the input had 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the next higher number in certain regions.\n\nBut how to determine which regions? Maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are part of a certain shape, like a cross or a line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of their position. For example, cells in certain positions (like the center) are increased. But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right or below. But that would require checking adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where the input had 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 2s or 3s based on their position.\n\nBut how to code this? Maybe the transformation is to replace each 1 with 2 if it's part of a certain shape, and 3 otherwise. But without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right. But that would not fit all examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the test input and output. The test input has a 1 in some positions, and the output has a 6 in some positions. So maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a higher number.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the maximum value in their row or column. For example, if a cell's row has a 3, it becomes 3. But this would not explain the changes in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the left or above. For example, if a cell is to the right of a higher number, it becomes that higher number. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where the input had 1s. In the input, there are regions where 1s are connected. For example, in the input, there's a cross shape of 1s. In the output, those 1s are replaced with 2s and 3s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 2s or 3s if they are part of a connected region of 1s.\n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are part of a connected region of a certain number. For example, if a cell is part of a connected region of 1s, replace it with 2. If it's part of a larger region, replace with 3.\n\nBut how to implement this. It would require connected component analysis. For example, find connected regions of the same number and replace them with higher numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each number with the next higher number if it's part of a certain shape. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the number of connected regions they are part of. For example, if a cell is part of a region with multiple connected cells, replace it with a higher number.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, cells in the middle are replaced with higher numbers.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, the numbers seem to be increased in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where the input had 1s. In Example 2, the output has 3s and 4s where the input had 1s. In Example 3, the output has 4s and 6s where the input had 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values based on their position in the grid.\n\nBut how to determine which positions. Maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with a higher number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right. For example, if a cell is to the left of a higher number, it becomes that higher number. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if a cell is in a row where there's a higher number, it becomes that number.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make a hypothesis. Let's think about the following: in the examples, numbers are replaced with higher values in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where the input had 1s. This suggests that the transformation might involve replacing numbers with higher values based on their position or neighboring cells.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the transformation replaces numbers with the maximum value in their row or column. For example, if a cell is in a row where the maximum is 3, it becomes 3. But this would not explain the changes in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right. For example, if a cell is to the left of a higher number, it becomes that higher number. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation might be to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right, but if that's not possible, then the cell below. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right if it's higher. But this would require checking each cell.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll try to think of a possible transformation that could fit the examples. Let's consider that the transformation replaces numbers with higher values based on their position in the grid. For example, numbers in the center are replaced with higher values, and numbers in the corners remain the same.\n\nBut how to implement this. Perhaps the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the center, replace it with a higher value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right. For example, if the cell to the right is higher, replace it with that value.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if a cell is in a row where there's a higher number, replace it with that higher number.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with a possible hypothesis: the transformation replaces each number with the maximum value in its row or column. For example, for each cell, find the maximum value in its row and column and replace the cell with that maximum. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right, but if that's not possible, then the cell below. This is similar to a flood fill algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation might be to replace numbers with the value of the cell in the same row, but only if it's higher. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all 0s. The second row has 0s and 1s, and the output has 0s and 1s. So maybe the transformation is to leave 0s as 0s, and replace other numbers with higher values based on their position.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are part of a certain shape. For example, if a cell is part of a cross shape, it's replaced with a higher number.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right. For example, if the cell to the right is higher, replace it with that value. Otherwise, leave it as is. This would require checking each cell's right neighbor.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 1 in the second row. The cell to the right might be 1, so it would remain 1. But the output has 2s and 3s. So this hypothesis might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right if it's higher. For example, if the cell to the right is higher, replace it with that value. Otherwise, replace it with the cell below. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll try to write a function that replaces numbers with higher values based on their position. For example, in the output, numbers are increased in certain regions. Maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right if it's higher, otherwise the cell below.\n\nBut without more examples, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right. For example, if the cell to the right is 1, replace it with 1. But this would not change anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right, but if that's not possible, then the cell below. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, there are regions where numbers are replaced with higher values. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s where the input had 1s. This might suggest that the transformation is to replace 1s with 2s or 3s if they are part of a certain shape.\n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with higher values if they are part of a connected region of a certain number.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. For each cell, determine if it is part of a connected region of a certain number.\n2. Replace the number with a higher value based on the size or shape of the region.\n\nBut how to implement this. For example, for each cell, check if it is part of a connected region of 1s, and if so, replace it with 2 or 3 based on the size of the region.\n\nBut this requires connected component analysis.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each cell, find the connected component of the same number.\n- Replace the number with a higher value based on the size of the component or other factors.\n\nBut how to determine the higher value. For example, in Example 1, the component of 1s is replaced with 2s and 3s. Maybe the size of the component determines the replacement value. For example, if the component has more than 5 cells, replace with 3, otherwise with 2.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each number with the next higher number if it is part of a connected region of the same number.\n\nBut this would require checking connected components.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- For each cell, find connected components of the same value.\n- Replace the value with a higher number based on the component's properties.\n\nBut how to determine the replacement value. For example, in Example 1, the component of 1s is replaced with 2s and 3s. Maybe the replacement value is based on the component's size. For example, if the component has more than 5 cells, replace with 3, otherwise with 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement value could be the number of cells in the component. For example, a component with 3 cells becomes 3.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has a 1 in a region that becomes 2 or 3. So this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement value is the number of cells in the component plus 1. For example, a component of size 2 becomes 3.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this hypothesis: the transformation replaces each number with the next higher number if it is part of a connected region of the same number. For example, if a cell is part of a connected region of 1s, replace it with 2. If it's part of a larger region, replace with 3.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's think about how to code this.\n\nFirst, we need to find connected components of the same value. Then, for each component, replace all its cells with a higher value. But how to choose the higher value.\n\nAlternatively, the higher value could be the value of the component plus 1. For example, if a component is of value 1, replace with 2. If it's of value 2, replace with 3, etc. But this would not explain the examples where numbers are replaced with higher values like 3 or 4.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has 1s that become 2s and 3s. So maybe the replacement value is based on the component's size. For example, if the component is large, replace with a higher value.\n\nBut without more information, this is hard to code.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right. For example, if the cell to the right is higher, replace it with that value. Otherwise, replace it with the cell below.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right, but if that's not possible, then the cell below. This would require checking each cell's right and below neighbors.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to code a function that replaces numbers with higher values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, replace it with a higher value.\n\nBut this is not a solid approach.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right, but if it's 0, then leave it as is. But this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation replaces each number with the next higher number if it is part of a connected region of the same number. For example, if a cell is part of a connected region of 1s, replace it with 2. If it's part of a larger region, replace it with 3.\n\nSo, the code would involve:\n\n1. Find all connected components of the same value.\n2. For each component, replace all its cells with the value + 1.\n\nBut this might not fit the examples, but it's a start.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a region of 1s. If we replace them with 2, then in the output, those 1s become 2s. But in the output, some of them are 3s. So this might not fit.\n\nBut maybe the replacement is to replace with the value +1 if the component is of a certain size.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is to replace with the value +1 for all components.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 2s and 3s. So this might not fit.\n\nAnother possible approach: the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right if it's higher. Otherwise, replace with the cell below. But this would require checking each cell.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to write a function that replaces numbers with the value of the cell to the right. If the cell to the right is higher, replace it with that value. Otherwise, replace with the cell below. If both are not possible, leave it as is.\n\nBut this is a guess. Let's code this.\n\nThe code would look like:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*30 for _ in range(30)]\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if j+1 < 30:\n                right = grid[i][j+1]\n            else:\n                right = 0\n            if i+1 < 30:\n                below = grid[i+1][j]\n            else:\n                below = 0\n            if right > grid[i][j]:\n                transformed[i][j] = right\n            elif below > grid[i][j]:\n                transformed[i][j] = below\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see if this fits the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 1 in the second row, and the cell to the right is 1, so it would remain 1. But the output has 2s. So this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace numbers with the maximum of the cell to the right and below. But this would not explain the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace numbers with the maximum of the cell to the right and below, but if that's not possible, leave it as is.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it might not fit the examples perfectly. The code would be:\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace numbers with the value of the cell to the right, but if it's 0, then replace with the cell below.\n\nBut again, this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace each number with the value of the cell to the right, but if that's 0, then replace with the cell below. If both are 0, leave it as is.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces each number with the maximum of the cell to the right and below. If that's not possible, leave it as is.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*30 for _ in range(30)]\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            max_val = grid[i][j]\n            if j+1 < 30:\n                max_val = max(max_val, grid[i][j+1])\n            if i+1 < 30:\n                max_val = max(max_val, grid[i+1][j])\n            transformed[i][j] = max_val\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace each cell with the maximum of itself, right, and below. However, this might not fit the examples, but it's a possible approach.\n\nTesting this with Example 1: the first row is all 0s. So the transformed grid would be all 0s. The second row has 0s and 1s. For example, the cell at (1,0) would have max(0, 0, 0) = 0. The cell at (1,1) would have max(1, 1, 0) = 1. But the output has 2s and 3s. So this might not fit.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it might not be correct. The code would be:\n\nBut wait, in the examples, the output has higher numbers than the input. So this approach might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the maximum of the cell to the right and below, but if that's higher than the current value, replace it. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut this is what the code above does.\n\nBut this might not fit the examples, but it's the best I can think of.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the value of the cell to the right, but if it's not possible, then the cell below. If both are not possible, leave it as is.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll proceed with the code that replaces each cell with the maximum of the cell to the right and below. This is a possible approach, even if it might not fit the examples perfectly.\n"
