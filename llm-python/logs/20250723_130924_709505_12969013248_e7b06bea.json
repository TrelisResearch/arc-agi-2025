              "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the patterns in the given training examples and derive a transformation rule that can be applied to the test input grid. Let's examine the training examples step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - In each example, there are specific values (like 5, 9, 6, 7, etc.) that appear in certain positions.\n   - The transformation seems to involve shifting these values to new positions while maintaining their original values in some form.\n   - There is a consistent pattern where certain values are moved to different positions, and the rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Analyze Specific Examples:**\n   - **Example 1:** The value 5 is moved to the top-left corner, and the value 3 is moved to the bottom-left corner.\n   - **Example 2:** The value 5 is moved to the top-left corner, and the value 9 is moved to the bottom-left corner. The value 8 is moved to the bottom-right corner.\n   - **Example 3:** The value 5 is moved to the top-left corner, and the value 9 is moved to the bottom-left corner. The values 6 and 7 are moved to different positions.\n   - **Example 4:** The value 5 is moved to the top-left corner, and the value 2 is moved to the bottom-left corner. The value 3 is moved to the bottom-right corner.\n   - **Example 5:** The value 5 is moved to the top-left corner, and the value 8 is moved to the bottom-left corner. The value 4 is moved to the bottom-right corner.\n\n3. **Formulate the Transformation:**\n   - Based on the patterns observed, we can hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n     - Moving the top-left value to the bottom-left.\n     - Moving the bottom-left value to the top-left.\n     - Maintaining the original values in the middle and right parts of the grid.\n\n4. **Implement the Transformation:**\n   - We will create a function that applies this transformation to the input grid.\n\nHere is the Python function implementing the transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid to avoid modifying the original grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the dimensions of the grid\n    n = len(grid)\n    \n    # Get the top-left and bottom-left values\n    top_left = transformed_grid[0][0]\n    bottom_left = transformed_grid[n-1][0]\n    \n    # Move the top-left value to the bottom-left\n    transformed_grid[n-1][0] = top_left\n    \n    # Move the bottom-left value to the top-left\n    transformed_grid[0][0] = bottom_left\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n\n# Example usage:\ntest_input = [\n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 3],\n    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 3]\n]\n\ntransformed_output = transform(test_input)\nfor row in transformed_output:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis function should work for the given training examples and the test input grid.
