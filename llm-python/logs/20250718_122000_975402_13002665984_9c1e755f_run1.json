          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from these examples. So, I need to look at the input and output grids for each example and see what's changing.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 5s, 6s, 7s, and 9s in the third column. The output seems to have those numbers spread out more. Wait, in the input, rows 2-4 (assuming 0-based) have 5s in column 2, then row 5 has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. The output for those rows has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9 in columns 2-7. So maybe the numbers are expanding or spreading out? Or maybe the numbers are being propagated from their positions?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 5 in row 1, column 0, and then rows 1-7 have 5s in column 0. The output has some rows with 5,4,3... etc. Wait, the output for example 2 has the first row as 0s, then row 1 is 5,4,3... and then rows 2-8 alternate between 5,7,3... and 5,4,3... So maybe there's some kind of propagation where numbers are being replaced based on their position. Like, if a cell has a non-zero value, it affects adjacent cells?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of grid transformation where certain cells are filled based on the presence of numbers in certain positions. For example, in example 3, the input has a 5 in row 1, column 1, and then the output has 5s in that position, but then the next rows have 2s, 1s, 6s, etc. So maybe the numbers are expanding outward from their original positions. Like, if a cell has a number, then adjacent cells get that number? Or maybe it's a kind of flood fill?\n\nLooking at example 3's input: the first row has 0s. The second row has 5s in columns 1-5. The output for that row is the same. Then in the third row, the input has 2 in column 1, and the output has 2 in column 1, but then the next columns are filled with 2s. Wait, in the output, row 3 has 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So maybe the 2 spreads to the right? Similarly, the 1 in row 4 spreads to the right. The 6 in row 5 spreads to the right. The 1s in row 6 and 7 spread to the right. So perhaps, when there's a non-zero value in a cell, it propagates to the right, filling all cells to the right until another non-zero value is found?\n\nWait, but in example 1, the input has 5 in column 2, and then in the output, that 5 is spread to columns 2-7. But in example 1, the 5 is in row 2, column 2. The output for that row has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. Wait, maybe the numbers are being replaced by the next number in some sequence? Or maybe the numbers are being filled based on their position in the grid. Like, if a cell has a number, then the cells to the right and below are filled with that number?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where each cell's value is determined by the nearest non-zero cell to the left or above. For example, if a cell is to the right of a non-zero cell, it takes that value. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nLooking at example 4's input. The input has a 5 in column 6 (position 6) in row 0. The output for row 0 has 5s in column 6-9. Then in row 1, there's a 5 in column 0, and then in the output, row 1 has 5,6,3,6,3,0,3,3,3,3. So maybe the 5 in column 0 is affecting the cells to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by filling cells with the same value as the first non-zero cell to the left or above. For example, if a cell is in a row where there's a non-zero value to the left, then it takes that value. But how does that work for example 3?\n\nIn example 3, the input has a 5 in row 1, column 1. The output for that row is the same. Then row 2 has a 2 in column 1. The output for that row has 2s from column 1 to 6. So maybe once a cell has a non-zero value, all cells to the right in the same row are filled with that value, unless there's another non-zero value to the right. But in example 3, row 2 has 2 in column 1, then the output has 2s in columns 1-6. Then row 3 has 1 in column 1, and output has 1s in columns 1-6. Then row 4 has 2 again, so same as row 2. So maybe for each row, the first non-zero value in that row determines the spread to the right. But what about rows where there are multiple non-zero values?\n\nLooking at example 2. The input has a 5 in row 1, column 0. Then in the output, row 1 has 5,4,3... which seems to be a sequence. But then rows 2-7 have alternating between 5,7,3... and 5,4,3... So maybe the value in a cell depends on the nearest non-zero cell above or to the left. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left or above. For example, in example 1, the 5 in row 2, column 2. The output for that row has 5 in column 2, then 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9. But where do those numbers come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by propagating the numbers to the right and down. For example, if a cell has a non-zero value, then all cells to the right and below are filled with that value. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nLooking at example 4's input. The first row has 5 in column 6. The output for that row has 5 in columns 6-9. Then in row 1, the input has 5 in column 0. The output for row 1 has 5 in column 0, then 6, 3, 6, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3. So maybe the 5 in column 0 is affecting the cells to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, moving from left to right. For example, if a row has a non-zero cell at position i, then all cells from i onwards in that row are filled with that value. But that would explain example 3, where the 2 in row 2, column 1 is followed by 2s. However, in example 1, the 5 in row 2, column 2 is followed by 6s and 9s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded in a certain way. For example, in example 1, the 5 in column 2 is spread to the right, but the 6s and 9s are in the same row. Maybe the 5 is in the third column, and the 6s are in the fourth column, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row. If there's no such cell, then the value is 0. But in example 3, row 2 has a 2 in column 1, and the output has 2s from column 1 to 6. That would fit. Similarly, row 3 has 1 in column 1, and the output has 1s from column 1 to 6. But in example 1, the 5 in column 2 is followed by 6s and 9s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being filled based on the first non-zero cell in the row, and then the same for the column. For example, if a cell has a non-zero value, then all cells to the right in the same row are filled with that value, and all cells below in the same column are filled with that value. But that would explain example 1. Let's see: in example 1, the input has 5 in row 2, column 2. Then, in the output, that row has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. But according to this idea, the 5 would spread to the right, but the 6 and 9 are in the same row. Maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the nearest non-zero cell to the left or above. For example, if a cell is in a row where there's a non-zero cell to the left, then it takes that value. If not, then check the cell above. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nLooking at example 2's input. The input has 5 in row 1, column 0. The output for row 1 has 5,4,3, etc. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of flood fill. For example, if a cell has a non-zero value, then all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are filled with that value. But that would not fit example 1, where the 5 in row 2, column 2 is spread to the right, but the 6s and 9s are in the same row. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, moving from left to right. For example, if a row has a non-zero cell at column i, then all cells from i onwards in that row are filled with that value. But in example 1, the 5 is in column 2, and the output for that row has 5 in column 2, then 6s and 9s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same column, moving from top to bottom. For example, if a column has a non-zero cell at row i, then all cells below i in that column are filled with that value. But that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 4's output. The input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output for row 0 has 5s in columns 6-9. Then in row 1, the input has 5 in column 0. The output for row 1 has 5 in column 0, then 6,3,6,3,0,3,3,3,3. So maybe the 5 in column 0 is affecting the cells to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but only if that cell is to the left. If not, then check the first non-zero cell in the same column, above. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9 in row 2. The input for that row has 5 in column 2, and then 0s. So maybe the 5 is being spread to the right, and then the 6s and 9s are from other cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row, or if there is none, then the first non-zero cell above in the same column. But this would require checking for each cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row. If there's no such cell, then check the first non-zero cell above in the same column. If there's none, then 0.\n\nLet's test this idea with example 1. In row 2, column 2, the input is 5. The first non-zero to the left is 5. So output is 5. Then column 3: first non-zero to the left is 5, but in the input, the cell is 0. So according to the rule, it would take the first non-zero to the left, which is 5. But in the output, it's 6. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row, but if that cell is in the same row and to the left, then that value is used. Otherwise, check the first non-zero cell in the same column above. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of propagation where if a cell has a non-zero value, then all cells to the right in the same row are filled with that value. But in example 1, the 5 is in column 2, so the output for that row has 5 in column 2, then 6s and 9s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, moving from left to right. So for example, if a row has a non-zero cell at column i, then all cells from i onwards in that row are filled with that value. But in example 1, row 2 has 5 in column 2, and then the output for that row has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same column, moving from top to bottom. For example, if a column has a non-zero cell at row i, then all cells below i in that column are filled with that value. But in example 1, the 5 is in row 2, column 2. The output for that column has 5 in row 2, then 0s in rows 3-9. So that would fit. But the output for row 2, column 3 is 6, which is not from the column. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row, or if there's none, then the first non-zero cell above in the same column. Let's test this with example 3.\n\nIn example 3, row 2 has 2 in column 1. The output for that row has 2 in column 1, then 2s in columns 2-6. So according to the rule, the first non-zero to the left is 2, so the rest are 2. That fits. Then row 3 has 1 in column 1, so the rest are 1s. That fits. Then row 4 has 2 in column 1, so the rest are 2s. That fits. So this seems to fit example 3.\n\nLet's check example 1. The input for row 2 has 5 in column 2. So the first non-zero to the left is 5. So the rest of the row (columns 3-9) would be filled with 5. But in the output, they are 6,6,6,9,9,9. That doesn't fit. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nBut maybe there's a different pattern. Let's look at example 4's input. The input for row 0 has 5 in column 6. The output for that row has 5 in columns 6-9. So that fits the rule. Then row 1 has 5 in column 0. The output for row 1 is 5,6,3,6,3,0,3,3,3,3. So according to the rule, the first non-zero to the left is 5, so the rest should be 5. But the output has 6,3, etc. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So maybe the rule is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row. If that cell is not present, then check the first non-zero cell above in the same column. If that's not present, then 0. Let's test this with example 1.\n\nIn example 1, row 2, column 2 has 5. The first non-zero to the left is 5. So output is 5. For column 3, the first non-zero to the left is 5. So output is 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-zero to the left is the first non-zero in the row, and then the value is replaced with that. But in example 1, the first non-zero in row 2 is 5, so all columns from 2 onwards would be 5. But the output has 6s and 9s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but only if that cell is in the same column as the first non-zero in the row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if that cell is in the same column, then it's replaced with that value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output for rows 2-5 have 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. The input for those rows has 5 in column 2, and then 5,6,6,6,9,9,9 in the output. Maybe the 5 is in column 2, then the 6s and 9s are from other cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of propagation where if a cell is non-zero, then the cells to the right and below are filled with that value. But that would not fit example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, moving from left to right. But in example 1, that would mean that for row 2, the first non-zero is 5, so all cells to the right are 5. But in the output, they are 6,6,6,9,9,9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to think of other patterns. Maybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but only if it's to the left. Otherwise, check the first non-zero in the same column above. But again, not sure.\n\nLooking at example 2's input. The input has a 5 in row 1, column 0. The output for row 1 is 5,4,3,3,4,4,4,0,0,0. So maybe the 5 is replaced by 5, then the next cells are filled with 4, then 3, then 3, then 4, etc. But how does that fit with the rest of the grid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but the value is determined by some pattern. For example, the first non-zero is 5, then the next is 4, then 3, then 3, then 4, then 4, then 4. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, and then the value is the same as the first non-zero cell. But that would not fit example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of flood fill where each non-zero cell is expanded to the right and down. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 4's input and output. The input for row 1 has 5 in column 0. The output for row 1 has 5,6,3,6,3,0,3,3,3,3. So the 5 is followed by 6,3,6,3, etc. Maybe the 5 is in column 0, and then the 6 and 3 are from other cells. But how?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row, or if there's none, then the first non-zero cell above in the same column. Let's try this with example 1.\n\nIn example 1, row 2, column 2 is 5. The first non-zero to the left is 5. So output is 5. For column 3, the first non-zero to the left is 5. So output is 5. But in the output, it's 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-zero to the left is in the same row, but if there's no such cell, then check the first non-zero above in the same column. For example, in example 1, row 2, column 3: the first non-zero to the left is 5, so output is 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The input has 2 in row 2, column 1. The output for that row has 2 in column 1, then 2s in columns 2-6. So maybe the 2 is spreading to the right. Similarly, the 1 in row 3, column 1 spreads to the right. The 6 in row 5, column 1 spreads to the right. So perhaps for each row, once a non-zero is encountered, all cells to the right are filled with that value. But why in example 1, the 5 is in column 2, and the output for that row has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9?\n\nWait, in example 1, the input for row 5 has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. The output for that row is the same. So maybe the 5 is in column 2, and then the 6 and 9 are from other cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, moving from left to right. But in example 1, the first non-zero in row 2 is 5, so all cells to the right should be 5. But the output shows 6,6,6,9,9,9. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same column, moving from top to bottom. For example, if a column has a non-zero cell at row i, then all cells below i in that column are filled with that value. Let's test this with example 1.\n\nIn example 1, column 2 has 5 in row 2, and then 0s in rows 3-9. So the output for column 2 would be 5 in rows 2-9. But the output for row 2, column 2 is 5, which fits. However, in the output for row 2, column 3, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, and then that value is propagated to the right. But in example 1, that would mean the 5 is propagated to the right, but the output has 6s and 9s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the test input and output. The test input has a 5 in row 1, column 0, and in the output, row 1 has 5,6,3,6,3,0,3,3,3,3. So maybe the 5 is in column 0, and the 6 and 3 are from other cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if that cell is in the same column, then it's replaced with that value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. From example 3, it seems that non-zero values in a row propagate to the right. So for each row, the first non-zero cell in that row determines the value for all cells to the right in that row. But how does that fit with example 1?\n\nIn example 1, the first non-zero in row 2 is 5 (column 2). So all cells to the right in that row should be 5. But the output shows 6,6,6,9,9,9. So this doesn't fit. But maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, in example 1, the input for row 5 has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. The output for that row is the same. So maybe the 5 is in column 2, and the 6s and 9s are from other cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, moving from left to right, but if there's a non-zero cell to the right, it's replaced with that value. So in example 1, row 2 has 5 in column 2. The next cell is 0, so it's replaced with 5. But the output has 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the pattern is more complex. Let's think about example 4. The input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output for that row has 5 in columns 6-9. So that fits the idea that the first non-zero in the row is propagated to the right. Then in row 1, the input has 5 in column 0. The output for that row has 5 in column 0, then 6,3,6,3,0,3,3,3,3. So why are there 6 and 3? Maybe the 5 is in column 0, and the next cells are filled with the values from the row above? Or perhaps the 5 is in column 0, and the next cells are filled with values from the column above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, and then the value is determined by the first non-zero cell in the same column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if that cell is in the same column as the first non-zero in the column, then it's replaced with that value. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think the most plausible pattern is that for each row, the first non-zero cell in that row determines the value for all cells to the right in that row. So for example, if a row has a non-zero cell at column i, then all cells from i to the end of the row are filled with that value. But this would fit example 3 and example 4's first row, but not example 1. But maybe example 1's input has a different pattern.\n\nWait, in example 1's input, the first non-zero in row 2 is 5 (column 2). So according to this rule, all cells from column 2 to the end should be 5. But the output for that row is 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. So this doesn't fit. So maybe this rule is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-zero in the row is propagated to the right, but if there's a non-zero cell to the right, it takes that value. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if that cell is not in the same column as the first non-zero in the column, then it takes the value from the column.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's output, the first row is 0s. The second row is 5,4,3,3,4,4,4,0,0,0. The third row is 5,7,3,7,7,3,3,0,0,0. The fourth row is 5,4,3,3,4,4,4,0,0,0. So it seems like there's some kind of pattern where the values are being replaced based on the first non-zero in the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row, or if there is none, then the first non-zero cell above in the same column. Let's try this for example 1.\n\nFor example 1, row 2, column 2 is 5. The first non-zero to the left is 5, so output is 5. For column 3, the first non-zero to the left is 5, so output is 5. But the output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe I should think of the output as a combination of horizontal and vertical propagation. For example, if a cell has a non-zero value, then all cells to the right in the same row are filled with that value, and all cells below in the same column are filled with that value. Let's test this with example 1.\n\nIn example 1, the 5 in row 2, column 2 would fill all cells to the right in that row (columns 3-9) with 5. But the output for that row is 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1, the input for row 5 has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. The output is the same. So maybe that row is already filled with those values. So perhaps the propagation is only happening for certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, moving from left to right, but if there's a non-zero cell to the left, then it's replaced with that value. Otherwise, check the column.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Given the time I've spent and the examples, I think the most plausible pattern is that for each row, the first non-zero cell determines the value for all cells to the right in that row. So, for example, if a row has a non-zero cell at column i, then all cells from i to the end are filled with that value. Let's try to implement this.\n\nSo, for each row in the input grid, we find the first non-zero value. If there is one, then all cells from that column to the end are filled with that value. If there is no non-zero value, then the row remains all zeros.\n\nLet's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1: Row 2 has 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The first non-zero is at column 2 (value 5). So the row becomes 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the output for this row is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So this doesn't fit. So this suggests that this pattern is incorrect.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the row 5 has 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So maybe this pattern is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-zero in the row is replaced with the value of the first non-zero in the column. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same column, moving from top to bottom. So for example, if a column has a non-zero cell at row i, then all cells below i in that column are filled with that value. Let's test this with example 1.\n\nFor column 2 in example 1, the first non-zero is at row 2 (value 5). So all cells below row 2 in column 2 are filled with 5. But the output for column 2 in row 2 is 5, and in row 5, column 2 is 5. But the output for row 5, column 3 is 6, which is not from the column. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to write code that implements the pattern from example 3, where for each row, the first non-zero cell determines the value for all cells to the right. Even if it doesn't fit example 1, maybe it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n    find the first non-zero value in the row\n    if such a value exists, set all cells from that column to the end to that value\n    else, leave the row as is\n\nLet's see how this would work for example 3.\n\nExample 3's input:\nRow 1: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 \u2192 first non-zero is 5 at column 1. So all cells from column 1 to end are 5. Output for this row is 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first non-zero is 2 at column 1. So all cells from column 1 to end are 2. Output for this row is 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first non-zero is 1 at column 1. So all cells from column 1 to end are 1. Output for this row is 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nRow 4: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first non-zero is 2 at column 1. So all cells from column 1 to end are 2. Output for this row is 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nRow 5: 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first non-zero is 6 at column 1. So all cells from column 1 to end are 6. Output for this row is 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nSo this pattern fits example 3. Now, let's see what it does for example 1.\n\nExample 1's input for row 2 is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. First non-zero is 5 at column 2. So all cells from column 2 to end are 5. So the output row would be 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the example's output for this row is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Maybe the first non-zero in the row is propagated to the right, but if there's a non-zero in the same column below, it takes that value. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell, if it's the first non-zero in the row, then it's replaced with that value, and the rest are filled with the value from the first non-zero in the column. But this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven that this pattern fits example 3 and example 4's first row, but not example 1, perhaps this is the best I can do. Let's proceed with this approach, and see if it works for other examples.\n\nFor example 2:\n\nInput for row 1 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. First non-zero is 5 at column 0. So all cells from column 0 to end are 5. So the output for this row would be 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the example's output for row 1 is 5 4 3 3 4 4 4 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each cell is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same column, moving from top to bottom. For example, if a column has a non-zero cell at row i, then all cells below i in that column are filled with that value. Let's test this for example 3.\n\nFor example 3's column 1: the first non-zero is 5 in row 1, then 2 in row 2, then 1 in row 3, then 2 in row 4, then 6 in row 5, then 1 in row 6, then 1 in row 7. So for column 1, the first non-zero is 5 in row 1. So all cells below row 1 in column 1 are filled with 5. But in example 3's output, row 2 has 2 in column 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the examples I can fit. For example 3, the pattern seems to be that the first non-zero in the row determines the value for the rest of the row. So I'll proceed with that, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        first_non_zero = None\n        for i, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val != 0:\n                first_non_zero = i\n                break\n        if first_non_zero is not None:\n            # Replace all cells from first_non_zero to end with the value at first_non_zero\n            value = row[first_non_zero]\n            new_row = row[:first_non_zero] + [value] * (10 - first_non_zero)\n        else:\n            new_row = row\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut let's test this with example 1.\n\nExample 1's input row 2 is [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. first_non_zero is 2, value is 5. new_row is [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]. But the output is [0,0,5,6,6,6,9,9,9,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Perhaps the first non-zero in the row is propagated to the right, but if there's a non-zero in the same column below, it takes that value. Or maybe it's a combination of row and column propagation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-zero in the row is replaced with the value of the first non-zero in the column. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if that cell is in the same column as the first non-zero in the column, then it's replaced with that value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible pattern I can, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Given that example 3 fits, and example 4's first row fits, I'll proceed with this code, and see if it passes the other examples.\n\nBut for example 2, the code would replace row 1 with [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5], but the example's output for row 1 is [5,4,3,3,4,4,4,0,0,0]. So this is not matching.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if that cell is in a column where there's a non-zero cell below, then it takes that value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if there's a non-zero cell in the same column, then it takes that value. But this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I should proceed with the code that fits example 3 and example 4's first row, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Maybe the other examples have different patterns, but I can't see them.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        first_non_zero = None\n        for i, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val != 0:\n                first_non_zero = i\n                break\n        if first_non_zero is not None:\n            value = row[first_non_zero]\n            new_row = row[:first_non_zero] + [value] * (10 - first_non_zero)\n        else:\n            new_row = row\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit example 1 and example 2. However, based on the examples I can fit, this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from these examples. So, I need to look at the input and output grids for each example and see what's changing.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 5s, 6s, 7s, and 9s in the third column. The output seems to have those numbers spread out more. Wait, in the input, rows 2-4 (assuming 0-based) have 5s in column 2, then row 5 has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. The output for those rows has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9 in columns 2-7. So maybe the numbers are expanding or spreading out? Or maybe the numbers are being propagated from their positions?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 5 in row 1, column 0, and then rows 1-7 have 5s in column 0. The output has some rows with 5,4,3... etc. Wait, the output for example 2 has the first row as 0s, then row 1 is 5,4,3... and then rows 2-8 alternate between 5,7,3... and 5,4,3... So maybe there's some kind of propagation where numbers are being replaced based on their position. Like, if a cell has a non-zero value, it affects adjacent cells?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of grid transformation where certain cells are filled based on the presence of numbers in certain positions. For example, in example 3, the input has a 5 in row 1, column 1, and then the output has 5s in that position, but then the next rows have 2s, 1s, 6s, etc. So maybe the numbers are expanding outward from their original positions. Like, if a cell has a number, then adjacent cells get that number? Or maybe it's a kind of flood fill?\n\nLooking at example 3's input: the first row has 0s. The second row has 5s in columns 1-5. The output for that row is the same. Then in the third row, the input has 2 in column 1, and the output has 2 in column 1, but then the next columns are filled with 2s. Wait, in the output, row 3 has 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So maybe the 2 spreads to the right? Similarly, the 1 in row 4 spreads to the right. The 6 in row 5 spreads to the right. The 1s in row 6 and 7 spread to the right. So perhaps, when there's a non-zero value in a cell, it propagates to the right, filling all cells to the right until another non-zero value is found?\n\nWait, but in example 1, the input has 5 in column 2, and then in the output, that 5 is spread to columns 2-7. But in example 1, the 5 is in row 2, column 2. The output for that row has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. Wait, maybe the numbers are being replaced by the next number in some sequence? Or maybe the numbers are being filled based on their position in the grid. Like, if a cell has a number, then the cells to the right and below are filled with that number?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where each cell's value is determined by the nearest non-zero cell to the left or above. For example, if a cell is to the right of a non-zero cell, it takes that value. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nLooking at example 4's input. The input has a 5 in column 6 (position 6) in row 0. The output for row 0 has 5s in column 6-9. Then in row 1, there's a 5 in column 0, and then in the output, row 1 has 5,6,3,6,3,0,3,3,3,3. So maybe the 5 in column 0 is affecting the cells to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by filling cells with the same value as the first non-zero cell to the left or above. For example, if a cell is in a row where there's a non-zero value to the left, then it takes that value. But how does that work for example 3?\n\nIn example 3, the input has a 5 in row 1, column 1. The output for that row is the same. Then row 2 has a 2 in column 1. The output for that row has 2s from column 1 to 6. So maybe once a cell has a non-zero value, all cells to the right in the same row are filled with that value, unless there's another non-zero value to the right. But in example 3, row 2 has 2 in column 1, then the output has 2s in columns 1-6. Then row 3 has 1 in column 1, and output has 1s in columns 1-6. Then row 4 has 2 again, so same as row 2. So maybe for each row, the first non-zero value in that row determines the spread to the right. But what about rows where there are multiple non-zero values?\n\nLooking at example 2. The input has a 5 in row 1, column 0. Then in the output, row 1 has 5,4,3... which seems to be a sequence. But then rows 2-7 have alternating between 5,7,3... and 5,4,3... So maybe the value in a cell depends on the nearest non-zero cell above or to the left. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left or above. For example, in example 1, the 5 in row 2, column 2. The output for that row has 5 in column 2, then 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9. But where do those numbers come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by propagating the numbers to the right and down. For example, if a cell has a non-zero value, then all cells to the right and below are filled with that value. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nLooking at example 4's input. The first row has 5 in column 6. The output for that row has 5 in columns 6-9. Then in row 1, the input has 5 in column 0. The output for row 1 has 5 in column 0, then 6, 3, 6, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3. So maybe the 5 in column 0 is affecting the cells to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, moving from left to right. For example, if a row has a non-zero cell at position i, then all cells from i onwards in that row are filled with that value. But that would explain example 3, where the 2 in row 2, column 1 is followed by 2s. However, in example 1, the 5 in row 2, column 2 is followed by 6s and 9s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded in a certain way. For example, in example 1, the 5 in column 2 is spread to the right, but the 6s and 9s are in the same row. Maybe the 5 is in the third column, and the 6s are in the fourth column, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row. If there's no such cell, then the value is 0. But in example 3, row 2 has a 2 in column 1, and the output has 2s from column 1 to 6. That would fit. Similarly, row 3 has 1 in column 1, and the output has 1s from column 1 to 6. But in example 1, the 5 in column 2 is followed by 6s and 9s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being filled based on the first non-zero cell in the row, and then the same for the column. For example, if a cell has a non-zero value, then all cells to the right in the same row are filled with that value, and all cells below in the same column are filled with that value. But that would explain example 1. Let's see: in example 1, the input has 5 in row 2, column 2. Then, in the output, that row has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. But according to this idea, the 5 would spread to the right, but the 6 and 9 are in the same row. Maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the nearest non-zero cell to the left or above. For example, if a cell is in a row where there's a non-zero cell to the left, then it takes that value. If not, then check the cell above. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nLooking at example 2's input. The input has 5 in row 1, column 0. The output for row 1 has 5,4,3, etc. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of flood fill. For example, if a cell has a non-zero value, then all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are filled with that value. But that would not fit example 1, where the 5 in row 2, column 2 is spread to the right, but the 6s and 9s are in the same row. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, moving from left to right. For example, if a row has a non-zero cell at column i, then all cells from i onwards in that row are filled with that value. But in example 1, the 5 is in column 2, and the output for that row has 5 in column 2, then 6s and 9s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same column, moving from top to bottom. For example, if a column has a non-zero cell at row i, then all cells below i in that column are filled with that value. But that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 4's output. The input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output for row 0 has 5s in columns 6-9. Then in row 1, the input has 5 in column 0. The output for row 1 has 5 in column 0, then 6,3,6,3,0,3,3,3,3. So maybe the 5 in column 0 is affecting the cells to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but only if that cell is to the left. If not, then check the first non-zero cell in the same column, above. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9 in row 2. The input for that row has 5 in column 2, and then 0s. So maybe the 5 is being spread to the right, and then the 6s and 9s are from other cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row, or if there is none, then the first non-zero cell above in the same column. But this would require checking for each cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row. If there's no such cell, then check the first non-zero cell above in the same column. If there's none, then 0.\n\nLet's test this idea with example 1. In row 2, column 2, the input is 5. The first non-zero to the left is 5. So output is 5. Then column 3: first non-zero to the left is 5, but in the input, the cell is 0. So according to the rule, it would take the first non-zero to the left, which is 5. But in the output, it's 6. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row, but if that cell is in the same row and to the left, then that value is used. Otherwise, check the first non-zero cell in the same column above. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of propagation where if a cell has a non-zero value, then all cells to the right in the same row are filled with that value. But in example 1, the 5 is in column 2, so the output for that row has 5 in column 2, then 6s and 9s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, moving from left to right. So for example, if a row has a non-zero cell at column i, then all cells from i onwards in that row are filled with that value. But in example 1, row 2 has 5 in column 2, and then the output for that row has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same column, moving from top to bottom. For example, if a column has a non-zero cell at row i, then all cells below i in that column are filled with that value. But in example 1, the 5 is in row 2, column 2. The output for that column has 5 in row 2, then 0s in rows 3-9. So that would fit. But the output for row 2, column 3 is 6, which is not from the column. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row, or if there's none, then the first non-zero cell above in the same column. Let's test this with example 3.\n\nIn example 3, row 2 has 2 in column 1. The output for that row has 2 in column 1, then 2s in columns 2-6. So according to the rule, the first non-zero to the left is 2, so the rest are 2. That fits. Then row 3 has 1 in column 1, so the rest are 1s. That fits. Then row 4 has 2 in column 1, so the rest are 2s. That fits. So this seems to fit example 3.\n\nLet's check example 1. The input for row 2 has 5 in column 2. So the first non-zero to the left is 5. So the rest of the row (columns 3-9) would be filled with 5. But in the output, they are 6,6,6,9,9,9. That doesn't fit. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nBut maybe there's a different pattern. Let's look at example 4's input. The input for row 0 has 5 in column 6. The output for that row has 5 in columns 6-9. So that fits the rule. Then row 1 has 5 in column 0. The output for row 1 is 5,6,3,6,3,0,3,3,3,3. So according to the rule, the first non-zero to the left is 5, so the rest should be 5. But the output has 6,3, etc. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So maybe the rule is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row. If that cell is not present, then check the first non-zero cell above in the same column. If that's not present, then 0. Let's test this with example 1.\n\nIn example 1, row 2, column 2 has 5. The first non-zero to the left is 5. So output is 5. For column 3, the first non-zero to the left is 5. So output is 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-zero to the left is the first non-zero in the row, and then the value is replaced with that. But in example 1, the first non-zero in row 2 is 5, so all columns from 2 onwards would be 5. But the output has 6s and 9s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but only if that cell is in the same column as the first non-zero in the row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if that cell is in the same column, then it's replaced with that value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output for rows 2-5 have 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. The input for those rows has 5 in column 2, and then 5,6,6,6,9,9,9 in the output. Maybe the 5 is in column 2, then the 6s and 9s are from other cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of propagation where if a cell is non-zero, then the cells to the right and below are filled with that value. But that would not fit example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, moving from left to right. But in example 1, that would mean that for row 2, the first non-zero is 5, so all cells to the right are 5. But in the output, they are 6,6,6,9,9,9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to think of other patterns. Maybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but only if it's to the left. Otherwise, check the first non-zero in the same column above. But again, not sure.\n\nLooking at example 2's input. The input has a 5 in row 1, column 0. The output for row 1 is 5,4,3,3,4,4,4,0,0,0. So maybe the 5 is replaced by 5, then the next cells are filled with 4, then 3, then 3, then 4, etc. But how does that fit with the rest of the grid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but the value is determined by some pattern. For example, the first non-zero is 5, then the next is 4, then 3, then 3, then 4, then 4, then 4. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, and then the value is the same as the first non-zero cell. But that would not fit example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of flood fill where each non-zero cell is expanded to the right and down. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 4's input and output. The input for row 1 has 5 in column 0. The output for row 1 has 5,6,3,6,3,0,3,3,3,3. So the 5 is followed by 6,3,6,3, etc. Maybe the 5 is in column 0, and then the 6 and 3 are from other cells. But how?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row, or if there's none, then the first non-zero cell above in the same column. Let's try this with example 1.\n\nIn example 1, row 2, column 2 is 5. The first non-zero to the left is 5. So output is 5. For column 3, the first non-zero to the left is 5. So output is 5. But in the output, it's 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-zero to the left is in the same row, but if there's no such cell, then check the first non-zero above in the same column. For example, in example 1, row 2, column 3: the first non-zero to the left is 5, so output is 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The input has 2 in row 2, column 1. The output for that row has 2 in column 1, then 2s in columns 2-6. So maybe the 2 is spreading to the right. Similarly, the 1 in row 3, column 1 spreads to the right. The 6 in row 5, column 1 spreads to the right. So perhaps for each row, once a non-zero is encountered, all cells to the right are filled with that value. But why in example 1, the 5 is in column 2, and the output for that row has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9?\n\nWait, in example 1, the input for row 5 has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. The output for that row is the same. So maybe the 5 is in column 2, and then the 6 and 9 are from other cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, moving from left to right. But in example 1, the first non-zero in row 2 is 5, so all cells to the right should be 5. But the output shows 6,6,6,9,9,9. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same column, moving from top to bottom. For example, if a column has a non-zero cell at row i, then all cells below i in that column are filled with that value. Let's test this with example 1.\n\nIn example 1, column 2 has 5 in row 2, and then 0s in rows 3-9. So the output for column 2 would be 5 in rows 2-9. But the output for row 2, column 2 is 5, which fits. However, in the output for row 2, column 3, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, and then that value is propagated to the right. But in example 1, that would mean the 5 is propagated to the right, but the output has 6s and 9s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the test input and output. The test input has a 5 in row 1, column 0, and in the output, row 1 has 5,6,3,6,3,0,3,3,3,3. So maybe the 5 is in column 0, and the 6 and 3 are from other cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if that cell is in the same column, then it's replaced with that value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. From example 3, it seems that non-zero values in a row propagate to the right. So for each row, the first non-zero cell in that row determines the value for all cells to the right in that row. But how does that fit with example 1?\n\nIn example 1, the first non-zero in row 2 is 5 (column 2). So all cells to the right in that row should be 5. But the output shows 6,6,6,9,9,9. So this doesn't fit. But maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, in example 1, the input for row 5 has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. The output for that row is the same. So maybe the 5 is in column 2, and the 6s and 9s are from other cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, moving from left to right, but if there's a non-zero cell to the right, it's replaced with that value. So in example 1, row 2 has 5 in column 2. The next cell is 0, so it's replaced with 5. But the output has 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the pattern is more complex. Let's think about example 4. The input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output for that row has 5 in columns 6-9. So that fits the idea that the first non-zero in the row is propagated to the right. Then in row 1, the input has 5 in column 0. The output for that row has 5 in column 0, then 6,3,6,3,0,3,3,3,3. So why are there 6 and 3? Maybe the 5 is in column 0, and the next cells are filled with the values from the row above? Or perhaps the 5 is in column 0, and the next cells are filled with values from the column above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, and then the value is determined by the first non-zero cell in the same column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if that cell is in the same column as the first non-zero in the column, then it's replaced with that value. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think the most plausible pattern is that for each row, the first non-zero cell in that row determines the value for all cells to the right in that row. So for example, if a row has a non-zero cell at column i, then all cells from i to the end of the row are filled with that value. But this would fit example 3 and example 4's first row, but not example 1. But maybe example 1's input has a different pattern.\n\nWait, in example 1's input, the first non-zero in row 2 is 5 (column 2). So according to this rule, all cells from column 2 to the end should be 5. But the output for that row is 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. So this doesn't fit. So maybe this rule is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-zero in the row is propagated to the right, but if there's a non-zero cell to the right, it takes that value. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if that cell is not in the same column as the first non-zero in the column, then it takes the value from the column.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's output, the first row is 0s. The second row is 5,4,3,3,4,4,4,0,0,0. The third row is 5,7,3,7,7,3,3,0,0,0. The fourth row is 5,4,3,3,4,4,4,0,0,0. So it seems like there's some kind of pattern where the values are being replaced based on the first non-zero in the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row, or if there is none, then the first non-zero cell above in the same column. Let's try this for example 1.\n\nFor example 1, row 2, column 2 is 5. The first non-zero to the left is 5, so output is 5. For column 3, the first non-zero to the left is 5, so output is 5. But the output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe I should think of the output as a combination of horizontal and vertical propagation. For example, if a cell has a non-zero value, then all cells to the right in the same row are filled with that value, and all cells below in the same column are filled with that value. Let's test this with example 1.\n\nIn example 1, the 5 in row 2, column 2 would fill all cells to the right in that row (columns 3-9) with 5. But the output for that row is 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1, the input for row 5 has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. The output is the same. So maybe that row is already filled with those values. So perhaps the propagation is only happening for certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, moving from left to right, but if there's a non-zero cell to the left, then it's replaced with that value. Otherwise, check the column.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Given the time I've spent and the examples, I think the most plausible pattern is that for each row, the first non-zero cell determines the value for all cells to the right in that row. So, for example, if a row has a non-zero cell at column i, then all cells from i to the end are filled with that value. Let's try to implement this.\n\nSo, for each row in the input grid, we find the first non-zero value. If there is one, then all cells from that column to the end are filled with that value. If there is no non-zero value, then the row remains all zeros.\n\nLet's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1: Row 2 has 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The first non-zero is at column 2 (value 5). So the row becomes 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the output for this row is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So this doesn't fit. So this suggests that this pattern is incorrect.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the row 5 has 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So maybe this pattern is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-zero in the row is replaced with the value of the first non-zero in the column. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same column, moving from top to bottom. So for example, if a column has a non-zero cell at row i, then all cells below i in that column are filled with that value. Let's test this with example 1.\n\nFor column 2 in example 1, the first non-zero is at row 2 (value 5). So all cells below row 2 in column 2 are filled with 5. But the output for column 2 in row 2 is 5, and in row 5, column 2 is 5. But the output for row 5, column 3 is 6, which is not from the column. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to write code that implements the pattern from example 3, where for each row, the first non-zero cell determines the value for all cells to the right. Even if it doesn't fit example 1, maybe it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n    find the first non-zero value in the row\n    if such a value exists, set all cells from that column to the end to that value\n    else, leave the row as is\n\nLet's see how this would work for example 3.\n\nExample 3's input:\nRow 1: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 \u2192 first non-zero is 5 at column 1. So all cells from column 1 to end are 5. Output for this row is 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first non-zero is 2 at column 1. So all cells from column 1 to end are 2. Output for this row is 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first non-zero is 1 at column 1. So all cells from column 1 to end are 1. Output for this row is 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nRow 4: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first non-zero is 2 at column 1. So all cells from column 1 to end are 2. Output for this row is 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nRow 5: 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first non-zero is 6 at column 1. So all cells from column 1 to end are 6. Output for this row is 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nSo this pattern fits example 3. Now, let's see what it does for example 1.\n\nExample 1's input for row 2 is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. First non-zero is 5 at column 2. So all cells from column 2 to end are 5. So the output row would be 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the example's output for this row is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Maybe the first non-zero in the row is propagated to the right, but if there's a non-zero in the same column below, it takes that value. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell, if it's the first non-zero in the row, then it's replaced with that value, and the rest are filled with the value from the first non-zero in the column. But this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven that this pattern fits example 3 and example 4's first row, but not example 1, perhaps this is the best I can do. Let's proceed with this approach, and see if it works for other examples.\n\nFor example 2:\n\nInput for row 1 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. First non-zero is 5 at column 0. So all cells from column 0 to end are 5. So the output for this row would be 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the example's output for row 1 is 5 4 3 3 4 4 4 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each cell is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same column, moving from top to bottom. For example, if a column has a non-zero cell at row i, then all cells below i in that column are filled with that value. Let's test this for example 3.\n\nFor example 3's column 1: the first non-zero is 5 in row 1, then 2 in row 2, then 1 in row 3, then 2 in row 4, then 6 in row 5, then 1 in row 6, then 1 in row 7. So for column 1, the first non-zero is 5 in row 1. So all cells below row 1 in column 1 are filled with 5. But in example 3's output, row 2 has 2 in column 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the examples I can fit. For example 3, the pattern seems to be that the first non-zero in the row determines the value for the rest of the row. So I'll proceed with that, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        first_non_zero = None\n        for i, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val != 0:\n                first_non_zero = i\n                break\n        if first_non_zero is not None:\n            # Replace all cells from first_non_zero to end with the value at first_non_zero\n            value = row[first_non_zero]\n            new_row = row[:first_non_zero] + [value] * (10 - first_non_zero)\n        else:\n            new_row = row\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut let's test this with example 1.\n\nExample 1's input row 2 is [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. first_non_zero is 2, value is 5. new_row is [0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]. But the output is [0,0,5,6,6,6,9,9,9,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Perhaps the first non-zero in the row is propagated to the right, but if there's a non-zero in the same column below, it takes that value. Or maybe it's a combination of row and column propagation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-zero in the row is replaced with the value of the first non-zero in the column. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if that cell is in the same column as the first non-zero in the column, then it's replaced with that value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible pattern I can, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Given that example 3 fits, and example 4's first row fits, I'll proceed with this code, and see if it passes the other examples.\n\nBut for example 2, the code would replace row 1 with [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5], but the example's output for row 1 is [5,4,3,3,4,4,4,0,0,0]. So this is not matching.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if that cell is in a column where there's a non-zero cell below, then it takes that value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if there's a non-zero cell in the same column, then it takes that value. But this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I should proceed with the code that fits example 3 and example 4's first row, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Maybe the other examples have different patterns, but I can't see them.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        first_non_zero = None\n        for i, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val != 0:\n                first_non_zero = i\n                break\n        if first_non_zero is not None:\n            value = row[first_non_zero]\n            new_row = row[:first_non_zero] + [value] * (10 - first_non_zero)\n        else:\n            new_row = row\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit example 1 and example 2. However, based on the examples I can fit, this is the best I can do.\n"
