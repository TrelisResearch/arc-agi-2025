This suggests that each row in the input is being duplicated in the output.\n\nIn Example 1:\nInput:\n0 5 0\n5 5 2\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 5 0 0 5 0\n5 5 2 5 5 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nEach row in the input is repeated once in the output.\n\nIn Example 2:\nInput:\n3 0 0\n2 3 0\n2 1 8\n0 1 0\nOutput:\n3 0 0 3 0 0\n2 3 0 2 3 0\n2 1 8 2 1 8\n0 1 0 0 1 0\n\nAgain, each row in the input is repeated once in the output.\n\nIn Example 3:\nInput:\n5 2 3 0\n2 5 3 0\n5 2 8 8\n0 0 6 0\nOutput:\n5 2 3 0 5 2 3 0\n2 5 3 0 2 5 3 0\n5 2 8 8 5 2 8 8\n0 0 6 0 0 0 6 0\n\nThis pattern continues - each row in the input is repeated once in the output.\n\nBased on this pattern, the transformation seems to be: take each row from the input grid and repeat it once to form the output grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new 3x6 grid by repeating each row of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        transformed_grid.append(row + row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
