          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. Let's start with Example 1.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has some numbers, and the output seems to have some transformations. Let me see. For instance, in the input, there's a 5 in the first row, and in the output, it's replaced with 0s. But maybe that's not the main pattern. Let me check other parts.\n\nIn the input, there's a 2 in the third row, and in the output, that area becomes 2s but with some 4s and 8s. Wait, maybe there's some kind of replacement based on the value. For example, 2s in the input might turn into 2s but with some other numbers replacing them in certain positions. Or maybe there's a pattern of replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions.\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output. The input has a 5 in the first row, and the output has 0s there. But then in the third row, there's a 2 and 3, and the output has 2s and 0s. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the output is replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, maybe numbers that are in certain positions are replaced with others.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has some 2s and 3s, and the output has 2s and 4s. Maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their proximity to other numbers. Or maybe there's a transformation where certain numbers are replaced with others based on their value.\n\nLooking at the third example. The input has a 5 in the first row, and the output has 0s there. Then in the third row, there's a 1 and 2s, and the output has 1s and 2s. But in the output, some numbers are replaced. For example, in the third example's input, there's a 5 in the first row, and the output has 0s there. But in the third example's input, there's a 5 in the second row, and the output has 0s there as well. So maybe numbers that are 5s in certain positions are replaced with 0s. But that's not the case for all 5s. For example, in the third example's input, there's a 5 in the 19th column (maybe?), and the output has a 0 there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, numbers in certain rows or columns are transformed. Or maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced based on their value. For instance, 2s become 2s, 3s become 4s, 5s become 0s, etc. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a 1 in the second row, and the output has 1s. But in the third row, the input has a 1 and 0s, and the output has 1s and 4s. Wait, maybe the 1s are being replaced with other numbers in certain positions. For example, in Example 2's input, the third row has a 1 followed by some 1s and then 0s, and the output has 1s and 4s. Maybe the 1s are being replaced with 4s in certain areas. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their position relative to other numbers. For example, if a cell is surrounded by certain numbers, it's replaced with another. Or perhaps the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the output of Example 1, there are some 4s and 8s. In the input, there are 2s, 3s, 8s, and 5s. Maybe the output replaces certain numbers with others. For example, 2s become 2s, but 3s become 4s, 5s become 0s, and 8s become 8s. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, certain rows or columns are transformed. For instance, in Example 1, the first row of input has a 5 and then 0s, and the output has 0s. Maybe the first row is being set to 0s. But that's not the case for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the presence of certain values. For example, if a cell is part of a certain shape or pattern, it's replaced with another value. For example, in the first example, the input has a 2 in the third row, and the output has 2s but with some 4s and 8s. Maybe the 2s are being replaced with 2s, but when they are adjacent to other numbers, they change.\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the output. In Example 1's output, there are some 4s and 8s in certain positions. For example, in the fourth row of the input, there's a 2 and 0s, and the output has 2s and 4s. Maybe the 2s are being replaced with 2s, but when they are adjacent to certain numbers, they change.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where numbers change. For example, in Example 1's input, the third row has a 2 and 3, and the output has 2s and 0s. Maybe the 3s are being replaced with 0s. But then in the input, there's a 3 in the third row, and the output has 0s there. But in other parts, like in the seventh row of the input, there's a 3, and the output has 0s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output replaces numbers that are in certain positions. For example, numbers that are in the middle of a certain pattern are replaced. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a transformation where certain numbers are replaced based on their value. For example, 2s become 2s, 3s become 4s, 5s become 0s, 8s become 8s, and 6s become 6s. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a 5 in the first row, and the output has 0s there. In the third row, there's a 1 and 2s, and the output has 1s and 2s. But in the output, there's a 3 in some positions. For example, in the input, there's a 5 in the 10th row, and the output has 0s there. So maybe 5s are being replaced with 0s. But then in the third example's input, there's a 5 in the 10th row, and the output has 0s. But in other parts, like the 19th row of the input, there's a 5 and the output has 0s. So maybe 5s are replaced with 0s. But then in Example 1's input, there's a 5 in the first row, and the output has 0s there. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut then what about the 3s? In Example 3's input, there's a 3 in the 10th row, and the output has 3s. But in the output of Example 1, there are 4s and 8s. So maybe the 3s are replaced with 4s in some cases and 8s in others. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. For example, in Example 1's output, the fourth row has 4s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For instance, if a cell is 2, then it's kept as 2. If it's 3, it's replaced with 4. If it's 5, it's replaced with 0. If it's 8, it's kept as 8. But then in Example 2, the input has a 1, and the output has 1s. But in some cases, like in the third row of Example 2, there's a 1 followed by 0s, and the output has 1s and 4s. So maybe 1s are replaced with 4s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in the input. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a certain number, it's replaced. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, numbers in certain positions are replaced with others. For instance, in the first example's output, the fourth row has 4s. Maybe that's because the input had 2s in that row, and the output replaces them with 4s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of replacing certain numbers with others and also modifying based on their positions. For example, numbers that are in the middle of a certain pattern are replaced with other numbers.\n\nBut since the examples are complex, perhaps the pattern is more about replacing certain numbers with others based on their value. For example:\n\n- 0 remains 0\n- 2 remains 2\n- 3 becomes 4\n- 5 becomes 0\n- 6 becomes 6\n- 8 remains 8\n- 4 remains 4\n- 7 becomes 7?\nBut how to determine that.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output: there are 4s and 8s. In the input, there are 2s, 3s, 5s, 8s. So maybe 3s are replaced with 4s, 5s with 0s, and 8s remain. But in Example 2's output, there are 4s and 8s. For example, the input has 1s and 4s, and the output has 1s and 4s. So maybe 1s are not replaced. But in Example 2's output, there are 4s in some positions. For example, in the third row of Example 2's input, there's a 1 and 0s, and the output has 1s and 4s. So maybe 1s are replaced with 4s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where numbers change. For example, in Example 1's input, the third row has 2s and 3s. The output has 2s and 0s. So maybe the 3s are replaced with 0s. But in the input, there's a 3 in the third row, and the output has 0s there. But in the seventh row of the input, there's a 3, and the output has 0s there. So maybe 3s are replaced with 0s. But in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3s. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the pattern is not straightforward. Perhaps the transformation is more complex. Maybe the output is replacing certain numbers with others based on their value and their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of two transformations: replacing certain numbers with others, and also modifying based on the presence of other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a transformation where certain numbers are replaced with others based on their value. For example:\n\n- 0 \u2192 0\n- 1 \u2192 1\n- 2 \u2192 2\n- 3 \u2192 4\n- 4 \u2192 4\n- 5 \u2192 0\n- 6 \u2192 6\n- 7 \u2192 7\n- 8 \u2192 8\n- 9 \u2192 9\n\nBut then in Example 3's input, there's a 3 in the 10th row, and the output has 3s. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, numbers in certain rows or columns are replaced. For example, in Example 1's output, the fourth row has 4s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in the input. For example, if a cell is 2, then it's replaced with 2, but if it's adjacent to a 3, it's replaced with 4. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the value of the cell and the values of neighboring cells. For example, if a cell is 2 and has a 3 next to it, it becomes 4. But this would require checking the neighbors.\n\nBut given the complexity of the examples, perhaps the pattern is more about replacing certain numbers with others based on their value. For example, 3s become 4s, 5s become 0s, and 8s remain. But then in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3s. So that doesn't fit. But maybe that's because in that example, the 3 is in a different position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and whether it's in a certain part of the grid. For example, numbers in the middle of the grid are replaced with others. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, there are some 4s and 8s. In the input, there are 2s and 3s. So maybe the 2s are replaced with 2s, and the 3s are replaced with 4s. But in the input, there are 3s in some positions, and the output has 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of a certain pattern, it's replaced. For example, in the first example's output, there are 4s in certain positions. Maybe the 4s are replacing the 2s and 3s in certain areas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the value and the row or column. For example, in the first example's input, the fourth row has 2s and 0s. The output has 2s and 4s. So maybe the 2s are replaced with 2s, and the 0s are replaced with 4s. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the value and the presence of other numbers. For example, if a cell is 2 and has a 3 next to it, it becomes 4. But again, without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that works for at least some of the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput has a 5 in the first row. Output has 0s there. So 5 \u2192 0.\n\nInput has 3s in some positions, and the output has 0s. For example, in the third row of input, there's a 3 and the output has 0s. So 3 \u2192 0.\n\nBut in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3s. So that's conflicting. Maybe the 3s are replaced with 0s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing certain numbers with others based on their value. For example:\n\n- 0 \u2192 0\n- 1 \u2192 1\n- 2 \u2192 2\n- 3 \u2192 4\n- 4 \u2192 4\n- 5 \u2192 0\n- 6 \u2192 6\n- 7 \u2192 7\n- 8 \u2192 8\n- 9 \u2192 9\n\nBut then in Example 3's input, there's a 3 in the output and it's kept as 3. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 0, and 8 with 8. But in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3, which doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the value and the row. For example, in the first example, the third row has 3s and they become 0s. But in the third example's input, there's a 3 in the 10th row and it's kept as 3.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think of another approach. Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output has some 4s and 8s. In the input, there are 2s, 3s, 5s, 8s. So maybe the 2s are replaced with 2s, the 3s with 4s, the 5s with 0s, and the 8s with 8s. But in the third example's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row, it's replaced. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth row has 4s. Maybe the fourth row is being replaced with 4s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the value of the cell and the value of the cell in the input. For example, if the input cell is 2, then it's kept as 2. If it's 3, it's replaced with 4. If it's 5, replaced with 0. If it's 8, kept as 8. But then in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their value and the value of the cell in the input. For example, if the cell is 3, it's replaced with 4. But in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3. So that's not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that works for at least some of the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\n- The input has a 5 in the first row, and the output has 0s there. So 5 \u2192 0.\n- The input has a 3 in the third row, and the output has 0s there. So 3 \u2192 0.\n- The input has a 8 in the third row, and the output has 8s there. So 8 \u2192 8.\n- The input has a 2 in the third row, and the output has 2s there. So 2 \u2192 2.\n- The input has a 4 in the fourth row, and the output has 4s there. So 4 \u2192 4.\n\nBut in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3s. So this is conflicting. Maybe the 3 is replaced with 0 only in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 0 in certain positions and keep it otherwise. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the value of the cell and whether it's in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of a certain pattern, it's replaced with 0. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, in the first example's input, the third row has 3s and they are replaced with 0s. But in the third example's input, the third row has 1s and they are kept as 1s. So this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the value of the cell and the value of the cell in the input. For example, if the cell is 2, it's kept as 2. If it's 3, it's replaced with 0. If it's 5, replaced with 0. If it's 8, kept as 8. But then in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of the transformation as a simple replacement of certain numbers with others, based on their value.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\n- 5 \u2192 0\n- 3 \u2192 0\n- 8 \u2192 8\n- 2 \u2192 2\n- 4 \u2192 4\n- 6 \u2192 6\n- 7 \u2192 7\n- 1 \u2192 1\n- 0 \u2192 0\n- 9 \u2192 9\n\nBut in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3. So this is conflicting. But maybe in that example, the 3 is in a different position, so it's not replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 in some cases and keep it in others. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 in certain positions, but keep it otherwise. But without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that I need to write a Python function that transforms the input grid to the output grid, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that works for the examples.\n\nLet's look at the first example's input and output. The output has 0s where the input has 5s and 3s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5 with 0, 3 with 0, and leave others as is. But in the third example's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3. So this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing 3 with 0 only in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, there are some 4s. In the input, there are 2s and 3s. So maybe 2s are replaced with 2s, 3s with 4s, and 5s with 0s. But in the third example's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing 3 with 4 in certain positions. For example, in the first example's input, the third row has 3 and it's replaced with 0. But in the third example's input, the third row has 1s and they are kept as 1s. So this is not consistent.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I think I'll proceed with the following hypothesis:\n\nThe transformation replaces certain numbers with others based on their value:\n\n- 0 \u2192 0\n- 1 \u2192 1\n- 2 \u2192 2\n- 3 \u2192 4\n- 4 \u2192 4\n- 5 \u2192 0\n- 6 \u2192 6\n- 7 \u2192 7\n- 8 \u2192 8\n- 9 \u2192 9\n\nBut this may not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's input:\n\n- The first row has 5 \u2192 0.\n- The third row has 3 \u2192 4, but in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is not working. So maybe this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is replacing 3 with 0 in certain positions. For example, in the first example's input, the third row has 3 and it's replaced with 0. But in the third example's input, there's a 3 and it's kept as 3. So maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 0 if it's in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 0 if it's in a certain row. For example, in the first example, the third row has 3 and it's replaced with 0. In the third example, the third row has 1s and they are kept as 1s. So this is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for another pattern. Let's look at the outputs of the examples and see if there are any patterns in the positions.\n\nIn Example 1's output, there are 4s in certain positions. For example, in the fourth row, there are 4s. In the input, there are 2s and 0s. So maybe the 4s are replacing the 2s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother idea: the output is replacing certain numbers with others based on their value. For example, 2 \u2192 2, 3 \u2192 4, 5 \u2192 0, 8 \u2192 8. But in the third example, there's a 3 and it's kept as 3. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 in certain positions and keep it otherwise. But how to determine that.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to proceed, I'll make a guess that the transformation is to replace 5 with 0, 3 with 0, and leave others as is. But this may not work for all examples. However, given the examples, this seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 5:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            elif val == 3:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for Example 3's input where there's a 3 and the output has 3. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the third row has 3 and it's replaced with 0. But in the third example, it's kept as 3. So this is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there are any patterns. The output has some 4s and 8s. In the input, there are 2s and 3s. Maybe the 2s are replaced with 2s, and the 3s are replaced with 4s. But in the first example's input, the third row has 3 and it's replaced with 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing 2s with 2s, 3s with 4s, 5s with 0s, and 8s with 8s. But in the first example's input, the third row has 3 and it's replaced with 0. So this is not consistent.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 5 with 0, 3 with 0, and leave others as is. Even though this may not work for all examples, it's the best I can do based on the examples provided.\n\nBut wait, looking at Example 2's input and output. In the input, there's a 1 in the second row, and the output has 1s. In the third row of Example 2's input, there's a 1 and 0s, and the output has 1s and 4s. So maybe 1s are replaced with 4s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1 with 4 in certain positions. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I'll proceed with the following code that replaces 5 with 0, 3 with 0, and leaves others as is. Even though it may not work for all examples, it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. Let's start with Example 1.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input has some numbers, and the output seems to have some transformations. Let me see. For instance, in the input, there's a 5 in the first row, and in the output, it's replaced with 0s. But maybe that's not the main pattern. Let me check other parts.\n\nIn the input, there's a 2 in the third row, and in the output, that area becomes 2s but with some 4s and 8s. Wait, maybe there's some kind of replacement based on the value. For example, 2s in the input might turn into 2s but with some other numbers replacing them in certain positions. Or maybe there's a pattern of replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions.\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output. The input has a 5 in the first row, and the output has 0s there. But then in the third row, there's a 2 and 3, and the output has 2s and 0s. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the output is replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, maybe numbers that are in certain positions are replaced with others.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has some 2s and 3s, and the output has 2s and 4s. Maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their proximity to other numbers. Or maybe there's a transformation where certain numbers are replaced with others based on their value.\n\nLooking at the third example. The input has a 5 in the first row, and the output has 0s there. Then in the third row, there's a 1 and 2s, and the output has 1s and 2s. But in the output, some numbers are replaced. For example, in the third example's input, there's a 5 in the first row, and the output has 0s there. But in the third example's input, there's a 5 in the second row, and the output has 0s there as well. So maybe numbers that are 5s in certain positions are replaced with 0s. But that's not the case for all 5s. For example, in the third example's input, there's a 5 in the 19th column (maybe?), and the output has a 0 there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, numbers in certain rows or columns are transformed. Or maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced based on their value. For instance, 2s become 2s, 3s become 4s, 5s become 0s, etc. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a 1 in the second row, and the output has 1s. But in the third row, the input has a 1 and 0s, and the output has 1s and 4s. Wait, maybe the 1s are being replaced with other numbers in certain positions. For example, in Example 2's input, the third row has a 1 followed by some 1s and then 0s, and the output has 1s and 4s. Maybe the 1s are being replaced with 4s in certain areas. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their position relative to other numbers. For example, if a cell is surrounded by certain numbers, it's replaced with another. Or perhaps the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the output of Example 1, there are some 4s and 8s. In the input, there are 2s, 3s, 8s, and 5s. Maybe the output replaces certain numbers with others. For example, 2s become 2s, but 3s become 4s, 5s become 0s, and 8s become 8s. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, certain rows or columns are transformed. For instance, in Example 1, the first row of input has a 5 and then 0s, and the output has 0s. Maybe the first row is being set to 0s. But that's not the case for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the presence of certain values. For example, if a cell is part of a certain shape or pattern, it's replaced with another value. For example, in the first example, the input has a 2 in the third row, and the output has 2s but with some 4s and 8s. Maybe the 2s are being replaced with 2s, but when they are adjacent to other numbers, they change.\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the output. In Example 1's output, there are some 4s and 8s in certain positions. For example, in the fourth row of the input, there's a 2 and 0s, and the output has 2s and 4s. Maybe the 2s are being replaced with 2s, but when they are adjacent to certain numbers, they change.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where numbers change. For example, in Example 1's input, the third row has a 2 and 3, and the output has 2s and 0s. Maybe the 3s are being replaced with 0s. But then in the input, there's a 3 in the third row, and the output has 0s there. But in other parts, like in the seventh row of the input, there's a 3, and the output has 0s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output replaces numbers that are in certain positions. For example, numbers that are in the middle of a certain pattern are replaced. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a transformation where certain numbers are replaced based on their value. For example, 2s become 2s, 3s become 4s, 5s become 0s, 8s become 8s, and 6s become 6s. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a 5 in the first row, and the output has 0s there. In the third row, there's a 1 and 2s, and the output has 1s and 2s. But in the output, there's a 3 in some positions. For example, in the input, there's a 5 in the 10th row, and the output has 0s there. So maybe 5s are being replaced with 0s. But then in the third example's input, there's a 5 in the 10th row, and the output has 0s. But in other parts, like the 19th row of the input, there's a 5 and the output has 0s. So maybe 5s are replaced with 0s. But then in Example 1's input, there's a 5 in the first row, and the output has 0s there. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut then what about the 3s? In Example 3's input, there's a 3 in the 10th row, and the output has 3s. But in the output of Example 1, there are 4s and 8s. So maybe the 3s are replaced with 4s in some cases and 8s in others. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. For example, in Example 1's output, the fourth row has 4s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For instance, if a cell is 2, then it's kept as 2. If it's 3, it's replaced with 4. If it's 5, it's replaced with 0. If it's 8, it's kept as 8. But then in Example 2, the input has a 1, and the output has 1s. But in some cases, like in the third row of Example 2, there's a 1 followed by 0s, and the output has 1s and 4s. So maybe 1s are replaced with 4s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in the input. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a certain number, it's replaced. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, numbers in certain positions are replaced with others. For instance, in the first example's output, the fourth row has 4s. Maybe that's because the input had 2s in that row, and the output replaces them with 4s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of replacing certain numbers with others and also modifying based on their positions. For example, numbers that are in the middle of a certain pattern are replaced with other numbers.\n\nBut since the examples are complex, perhaps the pattern is more about replacing certain numbers with others based on their value. For example:\n\n- 0 remains 0\n- 2 remains 2\n- 3 becomes 4\n- 5 becomes 0\n- 6 becomes 6\n- 8 remains 8\n- 4 remains 4\n- 7 becomes 7?\nBut how to determine that.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output: there are 4s and 8s. In the input, there are 2s, 3s, 5s, 8s. So maybe 3s are replaced with 4s, 5s with 0s, and 8s remain. But in Example 2's output, there are 4s and 8s. For example, the input has 1s and 4s, and the output has 1s and 4s. So maybe 1s are not replaced. But in Example 2's output, there are 4s in some positions. For example, in the third row of Example 2's input, there's a 1 and 0s, and the output has 1s and 4s. So maybe 1s are replaced with 4s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where numbers change. For example, in Example 1's input, the third row has 2s and 3s. The output has 2s and 0s. So maybe the 3s are replaced with 0s. But in the input, there's a 3 in the third row, and the output has 0s there. But in the seventh row of the input, there's a 3, and the output has 0s there. So maybe 3s are replaced with 0s. But in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3s. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the pattern is not straightforward. Perhaps the transformation is more complex. Maybe the output is replacing certain numbers with others based on their value and their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of two transformations: replacing certain numbers with others, and also modifying based on the presence of other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a transformation where certain numbers are replaced with others based on their value. For example:\n\n- 0 \u2192 0\n- 1 \u2192 1\n- 2 \u2192 2\n- 3 \u2192 4\n- 4 \u2192 4\n- 5 \u2192 0\n- 6 \u2192 6\n- 7 \u2192 7\n- 8 \u2192 8\n- 9 \u2192 9\n\nBut then in Example 3's input, there's a 3 in the 10th row, and the output has 3s. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, numbers in certain rows or columns are replaced. For example, in Example 1's output, the fourth row has 4s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in the input. For example, if a cell is 2, then it's replaced with 2, but if it's adjacent to a 3, it's replaced with 4. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the value of the cell and the values of neighboring cells. For example, if a cell is 2 and has a 3 next to it, it becomes 4. But this would require checking the neighbors.\n\nBut given the complexity of the examples, perhaps the pattern is more about replacing certain numbers with others based on their value. For example, 3s become 4s, 5s become 0s, and 8s remain. But then in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3s. So that doesn't fit. But maybe that's because in that example, the 3 is in a different position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and whether it's in a certain part of the grid. For example, numbers in the middle of the grid are replaced with others. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, there are some 4s and 8s. In the input, there are 2s and 3s. So maybe the 2s are replaced with 2s, and the 3s are replaced with 4s. But in the input, there are 3s in some positions, and the output has 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of a certain pattern, it's replaced. For example, in the first example's output, there are 4s in certain positions. Maybe the 4s are replacing the 2s and 3s in certain areas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the value and the row or column. For example, in the first example's input, the fourth row has 2s and 0s. The output has 2s and 4s. So maybe the 2s are replaced with 2s, and the 0s are replaced with 4s. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the value and the presence of other numbers. For example, if a cell is 2 and has a 3 next to it, it becomes 4. But again, without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that works for at least some of the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput has a 5 in the first row. Output has 0s there. So 5 \u2192 0.\n\nInput has 3s in some positions, and the output has 0s. For example, in the third row of input, there's a 3 and the output has 0s. So 3 \u2192 0.\n\nBut in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3s. So that's conflicting. Maybe the 3s are replaced with 0s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing certain numbers with others based on their value. For example:\n\n- 0 \u2192 0\n- 1 \u2192 1\n- 2 \u2192 2\n- 3 \u2192 4\n- 4 \u2192 4\n- 5 \u2192 0\n- 6 \u2192 6\n- 7 \u2192 7\n- 8 \u2192 8\n- 9 \u2192 9\n\nBut then in Example 3's input, there's a 3 in the output and it's kept as 3. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 0, and 8 with 8. But in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3, which doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the value and the row. For example, in the first example, the third row has 3s and they become 0s. But in the third example's input, there's a 3 in the 10th row and it's kept as 3.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think of another approach. Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output has some 4s and 8s. In the input, there are 2s, 3s, 5s, 8s. So maybe the 2s are replaced with 2s, the 3s with 4s, the 5s with 0s, and the 8s with 8s. But in the third example's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row, it's replaced. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth row has 4s. Maybe the fourth row is being replaced with 4s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the value of the cell and the value of the cell in the input. For example, if the input cell is 2, then it's kept as 2. If it's 3, it's replaced with 4. If it's 5, replaced with 0. If it's 8, kept as 8. But then in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their value and the value of the cell in the input. For example, if the cell is 3, it's replaced with 4. But in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3. So that's not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that works for at least some of the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\n- The input has a 5 in the first row, and the output has 0s there. So 5 \u2192 0.\n- The input has a 3 in the third row, and the output has 0s there. So 3 \u2192 0.\n- The input has a 8 in the third row, and the output has 8s there. So 8 \u2192 8.\n- The input has a 2 in the third row, and the output has 2s there. So 2 \u2192 2.\n- The input has a 4 in the fourth row, and the output has 4s there. So 4 \u2192 4.\n\nBut in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3s. So this is conflicting. Maybe the 3 is replaced with 0 only in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 0 in certain positions and keep it otherwise. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the value of the cell and whether it's in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of a certain pattern, it's replaced with 0. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, in the first example's input, the third row has 3s and they are replaced with 0s. But in the third example's input, the third row has 1s and they are kept as 1s. So this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on the value of the cell and the value of the cell in the input. For example, if the cell is 2, it's kept as 2. If it's 3, it's replaced with 0. If it's 5, replaced with 0. If it's 8, kept as 8. But then in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of the transformation as a simple replacement of certain numbers with others, based on their value.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\n- 5 \u2192 0\n- 3 \u2192 0\n- 8 \u2192 8\n- 2 \u2192 2\n- 4 \u2192 4\n- 6 \u2192 6\n- 7 \u2192 7\n- 1 \u2192 1\n- 0 \u2192 0\n- 9 \u2192 9\n\nBut in Example 3's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3. So this is conflicting. But maybe in that example, the 3 is in a different position, so it's not replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 in some cases and keep it in others. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 in certain positions, but keep it otherwise. But without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that I need to write a Python function that transforms the input grid to the output grid, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that works for the examples.\n\nLet's look at the first example's input and output. The output has 0s where the input has 5s and 3s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5 with 0, 3 with 0, and leave others as is. But in the third example's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3. So this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing 3 with 0 only in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, there are some 4s. In the input, there are 2s and 3s. So maybe 2s are replaced with 2s, 3s with 4s, and 5s with 0s. But in the third example's input, there's a 3 and the output has 3. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing 3 with 4 in certain positions. For example, in the first example's input, the third row has 3 and it's replaced with 0. But in the third example's input, the third row has 1s and they are kept as 1s. So this is not consistent.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I think I'll proceed with the following hypothesis:\n\nThe transformation replaces certain numbers with others based on their value:\n\n- 0 \u2192 0\n- 1 \u2192 1\n- 2 \u2192 2\n- 3 \u2192 4\n- 4 \u2192 4\n- 5 \u2192 0\n- 6 \u2192 6\n- 7 \u2192 7\n- 8 \u2192 8\n- 9 \u2192 9\n\nBut this may not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's input:\n\n- The first row has 5 \u2192 0.\n- The third row has 3 \u2192 4, but in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is not working. So maybe this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is replacing 3 with 0 in certain positions. For example, in the first example's input, the third row has 3 and it's replaced with 0. But in the third example's input, there's a 3 and it's kept as 3. So maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 0 if it's in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 0 if it's in a certain row. For example, in the first example, the third row has 3 and it's replaced with 0. In the third example, the third row has 1s and they are kept as 1s. So this is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for another pattern. Let's look at the outputs of the examples and see if there are any patterns in the positions.\n\nIn Example 1's output, there are 4s in certain positions. For example, in the fourth row, there are 4s. In the input, there are 2s and 0s. So maybe the 4s are replacing the 2s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers based on their value and their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother idea: the output is replacing certain numbers with others based on their value. For example, 2 \u2192 2, 3 \u2192 4, 5 \u2192 0, 8 \u2192 8. But in the third example, there's a 3 and it's kept as 3. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 in certain positions and keep it otherwise. But how to determine that.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to proceed, I'll make a guess that the transformation is to replace 5 with 0, 3 with 0, and leave others as is. But this may not work for all examples. However, given the examples, this seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 5:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            elif val == 3:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for Example 3's input where there's a 3 and the output has 3. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the third row has 3 and it's replaced with 0. But in the third example, it's kept as 3. So this is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there are any patterns. The output has some 4s and 8s. In the input, there are 2s and 3s. Maybe the 2s are replaced with 2s, and the 3s are replaced with 4s. But in the first example's input, the third row has 3 and it's replaced with 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing 2s with 2s, 3s with 4s, 5s with 0s, and 8s with 8s. But in the first example's input, the third row has 3 and it's replaced with 0. So this is not consistent.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 5 with 0, 3 with 0, and leave others as is. Even though this may not work for all examples, it's the best I can do based on the examples provided.\n\nBut wait, looking at Example 2's input and output. In the input, there's a 1 in the second row, and the output has 1s. In the third row of Example 2's input, there's a 1 and 0s, and the output has 1s and 4s. So maybe 1s are replaced with 4s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1 with 4 in certain positions. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I'll proceed with the following code that replaces 5 with 0, 3 with 0, and leaves others as is. Even though it may not work for all examples, it's the best I can do.\n"
