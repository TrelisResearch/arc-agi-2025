The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with 9s in specific patterns\n2. The 9s appear to be replacing values in a way that forms shapes or patterns\n3. The 9s seem to be replacing values in a way that depends on their position relative to other values\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with 9s based on their position and value.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace values with 9s based on position and value\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2 and (i > 2 or j > 2):\n                transformed[i][j] = 9\n                \n    return transformed\n```",
