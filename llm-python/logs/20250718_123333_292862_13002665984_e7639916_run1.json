          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 8s in certain positions, and the output has 8s and 1s around them. For instance, in the second row of the input, there's an 8 in the 4th column. The output for that row has an 8 in the same position, but then a bunch of 1s around it. Wait, in the output row 2, the 8 is at column 3 (if we start counting from 0?), and then there are 1s from column 4 to 14. Hmm, maybe that's a horizontal line of 1s expanding from the 8?\n\nLooking at the third row of the input, there's an 8 in column 15 (assuming 0-based indexing). The output for that row has an 8 in column 15, but also a 1 in column 1 (maybe?), and then another 8 in column 15. Wait, the output row 3 is 0 0 0 1 0 0 ... 8 0 0 0. So maybe the 8 is at column 15, and there's a 1 in column 3. Then in the fourth row of the output, there's a 1 in column 3, and then in the next rows, there's a 1 in column 3 and then 1s in other positions. \n\nWait, maybe the 8s in the input are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3 (assuming rows are 0-based). The output for that row has an 8 in the same position, but then a horizontal line of 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in the third row, there's an 8 in column 15, and the output has a 1 in column 3, and then in the fourth row, there's a 1 in column 3. So maybe the 8s are being replaced with a cross, but only in certain positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are acting as centers for expanding 1s. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in the same position, but then a horizontal line of 1s. Then, in row 2, the 8 is in column 3, but the output has 8 in column 3 and then 1s around it. Wait, maybe the 8s are being replaced with a cross shape, but the 8s themselves are kept in the output. \n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has an 8 in column 3, and then 1s around it. Also, there's an 8 in row 6, column 2 (assuming 0-based). The output for that row has an 8 in column 2, and then 1s around it. So maybe whenever there's an 8 in the input, it's replaced with a cross of 1s, but the 8 is kept in the output? Or maybe the 8 is part of the cross?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of regions where 1s are spread out. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output has 8 in that position, but then a horizontal line of 1s from column 4 to 14. Also, in row 2, the output has 1s in column 3 and 1s in columns 4-14. Wait, maybe the 8 is the center of a cross shape, but only in certain directions. \n\nAnother thing to note: in Example 1, the output for row 8 has an 8 in column 9 (assuming the input row 8 has an 8 in column 9?), and then the output has 8 in that position, but also 1s in columns 8 and 10. Wait, maybe the 8 is replaced with a cross, but the 8 is kept in the output. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of expanding regions. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has an 8 in the same position, and then 1s in columns 4 to 14. Then, in the next rows, the 8 is in column 15, and the output has 1s in columns 3 and 15. \n\nWait, perhaps the 8s in the input are the centers of a cross shape. So, for each 8 in the input, we create a cross of 1s in the output. But the 8 itself remains. However, in Example 1, the output for row 1 has 8 in column 3, but then 1s from column 4 to 14. That's a horizontal line. Then, in row 2, the output has 1s in column 3. So maybe the cross is vertical and horizontal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross, but only in certain directions. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has a horizontal line of 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in row 2, the output has a 1 in column 3. So that's a vertical line. So maybe the cross is a horizontal and vertical line. \n\nBut how does that work? Let's think about the positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, and then a horizontal line of 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in row 2, the output has 1 in column 3, and then in row 3, the output has 1 in column 3. So that's a vertical line of 1s from row 2 to row 7 (since in row 7, the output has 1 in column 3). Then, in row 8, the output has 1s in column 3 and 15. \n\nWait, maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of a cross that expands in all directions. But the 8 is kept as is. However, in the output, the 8 is present, but the surrounding cells are filled with 1s. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 8 in the same position as the input. So maybe the 8 is not changed, but the surrounding cells are filled with 1s. However, in Example 2, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3, and the output has 8 in that position, but then 1s around it. \n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, then 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in row 2, the output has 1 in column 3 and 1s from column 4 to 14. Similarly, in row 3, the output has 1 in column 3 and 1s from column 4 to 14. Wait, no, looking at the output for Example 1:\n\nRow 2 of output is 0 0 0 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So the 8 is in column 3, then 1s from column 4 to 14. Then row 3 of output is 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ... 8 0 0 0. So in row 3, column 3 is 1, and column 15 is 8. \n\nHmm, maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of a cross that expands in all directions. For example, the 8 in row 1, column 3 is the center of a horizontal line (from column 4 to 14) and a vertical line (from row 2 to row 7, column 3). Then, in row 8, the 8 is in column 9 (assuming that's where the input has an 8?), and the output has 8 in column 9, but then 1s in columns 8 and 10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of regions where 1s are spread out in certain directions. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, and then 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in the rows below, there's a vertical line of 1s in column 3. \n\nSo perhaps the transformation is: for each 8 in the input, create a cross shape of 1s in the output. But the 8 itself remains. However, in some cases, the 8 is part of the cross. \n\nBut how to model this? Maybe for each 8 in the input grid, we expand it into a cross shape. For example, for each 8 at (row, col), we set all cells in the same row (from col-1 to col+1) and same column (from row-1 to row+1) to 1. But wait, in Example 1, the 8 in row 1, column 3 has 1s from column 4 to 14. That's a horizontal line. So maybe the 8 is the center of a horizontal line and a vertical line. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is the center of a horizontal line that extends to the left and right, and a vertical line that extends up and down. But in Example 1, the 8 in row 1, column 3 has 1s from column 4 to 14. That's a horizontal line to the right. But why not left? Because in the input, there's an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, then 1s from column 4 to 14. So maybe the horizontal line is only to the right. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of a cross that expands in all directions, but the 8 is kept as is. However, in the output, the 8 is replaced with 1s. But in Example 1, the 8 is present in the output. \n\nThis is confusing. Let me look at Example 2. The input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, then 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in row 2, the output has 1 in column 3, and then 1s from column 4 to 14. So that's a vertical line. \n\nWait, maybe the 8 is the center of a cross that expands in all directions. So for each 8 in the input, we create a cross in the output. The cross is made of 1s, and the 8 is kept. But how to determine the size of the cross? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of regions where 1s are spread out in certain directions. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, and then 1s from column 4 to 14 (so to the right). Then, in the rows below, there's a vertical line of 1s in column 3. So that's a vertical line from row 2 to row 7. \n\nThis suggests that for each 8 in the input, the output has a horizontal line to the right and a vertical line downward. But why not left or up? \n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has an 8 in row 1, column 8. The output for that row has 8 in column 8, and then 1s from column 9 to 14. Then, in the next rows, there's a vertical line of 1s in column 8. \n\nBut in Example 3, there's also an 8 in row 6, column 2. The output for that row has 8 in column 2, and then 1s in column 3 and 1s in column 15. \n\nHmm, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross that expands in the right and down directions. But how to determine the exact positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross that expands in the right and down directions, but the cross is of a certain size. For example, in Example 1, the 8 in row 1, column 3 has a horizontal line of 1s from column 4 to 14 (so 11 cells), and a vertical line from row 2 to row 7 (so 6 rows). \n\nBut how to model this in code. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 8s are in the input and see what's happening in the output. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s in positions:\n\nRow 1, column 3 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's check the input and output. For example, in Example 1's input, the second row (row 1 if 0-based) is:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n\nSo the 8 is at column 3 (assuming 0-based). The output for that row is:\n\n0 0 0 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 \n\nSo the 8 is at column 3, and then 1s from column 4 to 14 (so 11 cells). \n\nThen, in row 2 of the output, the 8 is in column 3, but the output is:\n\n0 0 0 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 \n\nWait, no, row 2 of the output is the second row. Let me check the example again. \n\nExample 1's output is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s\nRow 1: 0 0 0 8 1 1 ... 1 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 1 0 ... 8 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 1 0 ... 1 0 0 0\n... and so on.\n\nSo for the input's 8 in row 1, column 3, the output has a horizontal line of 1s from column 4 to 14 (so 11 cells). Then, in row 2, column 3 is 1. Then in row 3, column 3 is 1. And so on, until row 7, where column 3 is 1. Then row 8 has 1 in column 3 and 15. \n\nSo the vertical line is from row 2 to row 7 (rows 2-7 inclusive?), and the horizontal line is from column 4 to 14. \n\nSo perhaps the 8 is the center of a cross that extends to the right and down. \n\nBut how to model this. For each 8 in the input, we need to expand it into a cross that extends to the right and down. \n\nBut then, in Example 3, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 8. The output for that row has 8 in column 8, then 1s from column 9 to 14. Then, in the next rows, there's a vertical line of 1s in column 8. \n\nSo for each 8, we expand to the right and down. \n\nBut how to determine the range. For example, in Example 1, the horizontal line is from column 4 to 14 (so 11 cells). The vertical line is from row 2 to row 7 (6 rows). \n\nBut how to determine the exact positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is such that the horizontal line starts at column 3+1 (so column 4) and extends to the right until the end of the row. Similarly, the vertical line starts at row 1+1 (row 2) and extends down until the end of the grid. \n\nBut in Example 1, the horizontal line is from column 4 to 14 (so 11 columns). The row has 20 columns (since the output is 10x20). \n\nBut in that case, for each 8 in the input, the horizontal line would be from column (col+1) to the end of the row. And the vertical line would be from row (row+1) to the end of the grid. \n\nBut then, in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 3. So the vertical line would be from row 2 to row 9 (since the output is 10 rows). But in the output, the vertical line is from row 2 to row 7. \n\nHmm, that doesn't match. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is from row (row+1) to row (row+5). But that's arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is such that the horizontal line is from column (col) to the right, but only a certain number of cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is determined by the position of the 8. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in the second row (row 1), and the vertical line is from row 2 to row 7 (so 6 rows). \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is the center of a cross that expands in all four directions, but the 8 is kept as is. But in the output, the 8 is present, and the surrounding cells are filled with 1s. \n\nBut in Example 1, the 8 is present in the output. So perhaps the 8 is not changed, but the surrounding cells are filled with 1s. \n\nBut how to determine which cells are filled with 1s. \n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, and then 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in row 2, column 3 is 1. So that's a vertical line from row 2 to row 7. \n\nSo for each 8 in the input, the output has a horizontal line to the right (from column+1 to end of row), and a vertical line downward (from row+1 to end of grid). \n\nBut that would mean that for an 8 in row r, column c, the output for that row would have 1s from c+1 to 19 (since the grid is 20 columns), and for each row below r, column c would be 1. \n\nBut in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 3. The output for row 1 has 1s from column 4 to 19 (but in the output, the row is 0 0 0 8 1 1 ... 1 0 0 0. So the 1s go from column 4 to 14, and then 0s. Wait, but the output is 20 columns. So maybe the horizontal line is from column 4 to 14, but not all the way to the end. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern where for each 8 in the input, we create a cross that extends to the right and down, but only for a certain number of cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross that expands in the right and down directions, but the cross is of a certain size. For example, in Example 1, the horizontal line is 11 cells long (from column 4 to 14), and the vertical line is 6 rows long (from row 2 to row 7). \n\nBut how to determine the exact positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is determined by the position of the 8. For example, if the 8 is in the first row (row 0), then the vertical line is from row 1 to row 5. But this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross is such that for each 8 in the input, the output has 1s in the same row, starting from column+1 to column+5 (for example), and in the same column, starting from row+1 to row+5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nLooking at Example 2: the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, then 1s from column 4 to 14 (so 11 cells). Then, in row 2, column 3 is 1. In row 3, column 3 is 1. In row 4, column 3 is 1. In row 5, column 3 is 1. In row 6, column 3 is 1. In row 7, column 3 is 0. \n\nWait, the output for Example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s\nRow 1: 0 0 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\nRow 7: all 0s\n\nSo for the 8 in row 1, column 3, the output has 1s in row 1, columns 4-10 (since the row is 12 columns?), and in row 2, column 3 is 1. Then in row 3, column 3 is 1. Row 4, column 3 is 1. Row 5, column 3 is 1. Row 6, column 3 is 8. \n\nSo the vertical line is from row 2 to row 5 (rows 2-5). \n\nHmm, this is inconsistent with Example 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of a cross that extends in certain directions. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 3. The output has a horizontal line to the right (from column 4 to 14) and a vertical line down (from row 2 to row 7). \n\nIn Example 2, the 8 is in row 1, column 3. The output has a horizontal line to the right (columns 4 to 10) and a vertical line down (rows 2 to 5). \n\nIn Example 3, the 8 is in row 1, column 8. The output has a horizontal line to the right (columns 9 to 14) and a vertical line down (rows 2 to 9). \n\nSo perhaps for each 8 in the input, the horizontal line extends to the right for a certain number of columns, and the vertical line extends down for a certain number of rows. \n\nBut how to determine the number of columns and rows. \n\nLooking at Example 1: the horizontal line is 11 columns (from 4 to 14). The vertical line is 6 rows (from 2 to 7). \n\nExample 2: horizontal line is 7 columns (from 4 to 10), vertical line is 4 rows (from 2 to 5). \n\nExample 3: horizontal line is 6 columns (from 9 to 14), vertical line is 8 rows (from 2 to 9). \n\nThis seems inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line extends to the right until the end of the row, but only for a certain number of columns. But how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from column+1 to column+5, and the vertical line is from row+1 to row+5. \n\nIn Example 1: column 3 + 1 = 4, column+5 = 8. But the horizontal line in Example 1 is from 4 to 14, which is much longer. So that doesn't fit. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the 8 as a center, and the output has 1s in the same row and column, but only in certain directions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replaced with 1s in the output, but the 8s themselves are kept. But that doesn't fit the examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross where the horizontal line is to the right and the vertical line is downward. But the length of the cross depends on the position. \n\nAnother idea: look at the positions where the 8s are in the input and see what their output is. For example, in Example 1, the 8 in row 1, column 3 has a horizontal line of 1s from column 4 to 14 (11 columns), and a vertical line from row 2 to row 7 (6 rows). \n\nIn Example 2, the 8 in row 1, column 3 has a horizontal line from 4 to 10 (7 columns), and vertical line from row 2 to 5 (4 rows). \n\nIn Example 3, the 8 in row 1, column 8 has a horizontal line from 9 to 14 (6 columns), and vertical line from row 2 to 9 (8 rows). \n\nSo perhaps the horizontal line length is 11, 7, 6, depending on the position. But how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from column+1 to column+10 (so 10 columns), but in Example 1, that would be 3+1=4 to 3+10=13, but the example has 14. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from column+1 to column+14 (but that would be way beyond the grid). \n\nThis is not working. Maybe I need to think of another approach. \n\nLet me think about the output for the input. For each cell in the input, if it's an 8, then in the output, it's replaced with a cross of 1s. But how. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross that is 3x3, but expanded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross that extends in all directions, but the 8 is kept. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 8 in the same position, and the surrounding cells are 1s. \n\nWait, for example, in row 1 of Example 1, the output has 8 in column 3, and then 1s from 4 to 14. So that's a horizontal line. In the same row, the 8 is at column 3, and the next cells are 1s. \n\nBut in the same row, the 8 is in the middle of the horizontal line. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each 8 in the input, the output has a horizontal line of 1s extending to the right from the 8, and a vertical line of 1s extending downward from the 8. \n\nSo, for each 8 at (r, c), in the output grid, for all columns from c+1 to 19 (the end of the row), set to 1. Also, for all rows from r+1 to 9 (the end of the grid), set the cell at column c to 1. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the 8 is at row 1, column 3. So the horizontal line would be from column 4 to 19, but in the output, it's only from 4 to 14. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from c+1 to c+10 (for example), and the vertical line is from r+1 to r+5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from c to c+10, and the vertical line is from r to r+10. But again, this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8 in the input is the center of a cross that extends to the right and down, but the length of the cross is determined by the distance from the edge. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 3. The horizontal line extends to the right until column 14 (which is 14-3 = 11 columns to the right). But why 11? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line extends for 10 columns to the right, and the vertical line extends for 6 rows down. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the output. \n\nIn Example 1, the output has 8s in the same positions as the input, but with 1s around them. For example, the 8 in row 1, column 3 is kept, and then the cells to the right are 1s. \n\nIn Example 2, the 8 in row 1, column 3 is kept, and the cells to the right are 1s. \n\nIn Example 3, the 8 in row 1, column 8 is kept, and the cells to the right are 1s. \n\nSo perhaps the transformation is: for each 8 in the input, in the output, the cell is kept as 8, and all cells to the right of it in the same row are set to 1, and all cells below it in the same column are set to 1. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, then 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in row 2, column 3 is 1. \n\nSo that would mean that for each 8 in the input, in the same row, all cells to the right of the 8 are set to 1, and in the same column, all cells below the 8 are set to 1. \n\nBut what about other cells? For example, in Example 1, the cell to the left of the 8 is 0 in the input, but in the output it's 0. So that's not changed. \n\nSo the transformation is: for each 8 in the input, set all cells to the right in the same row to 1, and all cells below in the same column to 1. \n\nBut what about other cells? For example, in Example 1, the cell in row 2, column 4 is 1. But why? Because it's to the right of the 8 in row 1, column 3? Or because it's below the 8 in row 1, column 3? \n\nWait, in row 2, column 3 is 1, which is below the 8 in row 1, column 3. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples. \n\nExample 1: input has 8 at (1,3). In the output, all cells to the right of (1,3) in the same row are 1. So columns 4-19 are set to 1. But in the output, it's only 4-14. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is the center of a cross that extends to the right and down, but only for a certain number of cells. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is the center of a cross that extends to the right and down, but the length is determined by the position. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in the second row (row 1), so the vertical line extends down to row 7 (6 rows), and the horizontal line extends to column 14 (11 columns). \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is determined by the position of the 8. For example, if the 8 is in the first row (row 0), then the vertical line extends down to row 5. If it's in row 1, then down to row 7, etc. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nMaybe I should think of the transformation as: for each 8 in the input, in the output, the cell is kept as 8, and all cells to the right in the same row are set to 1, and all cells below in the same column are set to 1. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output for row 1, column 3 is 8, and columns 4-14 are 1. But the row has 20 columns, so columns 4-19 would be 1, but in the output, it's only 4-14. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut perhaps the 8 is in the input, and in the output, the 8 is kept, and the cells to the right are set to 1, but only up to a certain point. \n\nMaybe the 8 is the center of a cross that extends to the right and down, but the length is determined by the distance from the edge. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the 8 is in column 3. The horizontal line extends to the right until column 14 (which is 11 columns to the right). Why 14? Maybe because it's the middle of the row. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line extends to the right for 10 columns, and the vertical line extends down for 6 rows. \n\nBut this is arbitrary. \n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for other patterns. \n\nLooking at Example 3: the input has an 8 in row 6, column 2. The output for that row has 8 in column 2, and then 1s in column 3 and 15. \n\nSo in the same row, the 8 is at column 2, and to the right is column 3 (1), and to the left is 0. \n\nIn the vertical direction, the 8 is in row 6, column 2. The output for row 7 has 1 in column 2. \n\nSo perhaps for each 8 in the input, the output has 1s to the right in the same row, and 1s below in the same column. \n\nBut in Example 3, the 8 is in row 6, column 2. The output for row 6 has 1 in column 3, and for row 7, column 2 is 1. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 3. The output for row 1 has 1s from column 4 to 14. But why not all the way to the end? \n\nMaybe the horizontal line extends to the right until the end of the row, but in Example 1, the output has 1s only up to column 14. \n\nThis suggests that the horizontal line is not extending to the end. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from column+1 to column+10, and the vertical line is from row+1 to row+5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from column+1 to column+10, and the vertical line is from row+1 to row+5. \n\nFor Example 1: column 3 +1 = 4, column+10 = 13. But the output has 1s up to column 14. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from column+1 to column+14, but that would be way beyond the grid. \n\nThis is not helpful. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on what I can see. \n\nThe pattern seems to be: for each 8 in the input, the output has a horizontal line of 1s to the right, and a vertical line of 1s downward. The 8 itself is kept. \n\nSo, for each 8 at (r, c), in the output, set all cells in the same row, from c+1 to the end of the row, to 1. Also, set all cells in the same column, from r+1 to the end of the column, to 1. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output for row 1 has 1s from column 4 to 14, but not all the way to the end. So this suggests that this hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nBut maybe the output is 10x20, and in Example 1, the row is 20 columns. So for row 1, column 3, the horizontal line would be from column 4 to 19 (16 columns), but in the output, it's only from 4 to 14. \n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from c+1 to c+10, and the vertical line is from r+1 to r+5. \n\nFor Example 1, c=3, so c+1=4, c+10=13. But in the output, it's up to 14. So this is not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from c+1 to c+11, but this is arbitrary. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that for each 8 in the input, the output has 1s to the right in the same row and below in the same column, and the 8 is kept. \n\nEven if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do. \n\nSo the plan is: \n\nFor each cell in the input grid, if it's an 8, then in the output grid, set all cells to the right in the same row to 1, and all cells below in the same column to 1. \n\nBut what about other cells? For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in row 2, column 3. This is because the 8 in row 1, column 3 has a vertical line below it. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nCreate a new grid of 10x20 filled with 0s. \n\nFor each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n\n   if the cell is 8:\n\n       for col in c+1 to 19:\n\n           set new_grid[r][col] = 1\n\n       for row in r+1 to 9:\n\n           set new_grid[row][c] = 1\n\nBut this would set all cells to the right and below to 1. \n\nLet's test this against Example 1. \n\nInput has 8 at (1,3). \n\nIn new_grid, for row 1, columns 4-19 are set to 1. \n\nFor rows 2-9, column 3 is set to 1. \n\nBut in the output, for row 1, columns 4-14 are 1, but not 15-19. So this would not match. \n\nBut perhaps the output is different. \n\nWait, in the example, the output for row 1 is:\n\n0 0 0 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 \n\nSo columns 4-14 are 1, and columns 15-19 are 0. \n\nBut according to the hypothesis, columns 4-19 should be 1. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nBut why is that? \n\nMaybe the 8 is not the only one affecting the cells. For example, other 8s in the input may also affect the cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross that extends in certain directions, but the 8 is not part of the cross. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible hypothesis, even if it doesn't fit all examples. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nCreate a new grid of 10x20 filled with 0s. \n\nFor each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n\n   if the cell is 8:\n\n       for col in range(c+1, 20):\n\n           new_grid[r][col] = 1\n\n       for row in range(r+1, 10):\n\n           new_grid[row][c] = 1\n\nBut this would set all cells to the right and below to 1. \n\nLet's see what this would do for Example 1. \n\nIn the input, there's an 8 at (1,3). So in new_grid, row 1, columns 4-19 are 1. Also, rows 2-9, column 3 are 1. \n\nBut in the output for Example 1, row 1 has 1s from 4-14, and then 0s. So this would not match. \n\nSo this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nBut perhaps the 8 in the input is replaced with a cross that extends in certain directions, but not all. \n\nMaybe the horizontal line is only to the right for a certain number of columns, and the vertical line is only down for a certain number of rows. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the horizontal line is from column 4 to 14 (11 columns), and the vertical line is from row 2 to 7 (6 rows). \n\nSo for each 8, the horizontal line extends for 11 columns to the right, and the vertical line extends for 6 rows down. \n\nBut how to determine these numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line extends for 10 columns to the right, and the vertical line extends for 6 rows down. \n\nBut this is arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line extends for 10 columns to the right, and the vertical line extends for 6 rows down, but this is just a guess. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the code that implements the hypothesis that for each 8 in the input, the output has 1s to the right and below, even if it doesn't fit all examples. \n\nBut given that the test input has an 8 in row 3, column 3 (assuming 0-based), and the output would have 1s to the right and below, but the actual output may vary. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(10)]\n    for r in range(10):\n        for c in range(20):\n            if grid[r][c] == 8:\n                # Set all to the right in the same row\n                for col in range(c+1, 20):\n                    new_grid[r][col] = 1\n                # Set all below in the same column\n                for row in range(r+1, 10):\n                    new_grid[row][c] = 1\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this would set all cells to the right and below to 1. \n\nBut in Example 1, this would set row 1, columns 4-19 to 1, which doesn't match the output. \n\nSo this suggests that this is not the correct pattern. \n\nBut perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the 8 is replaced with a cross of 1s, but the 8 itself is replaced with 1s. \n\nBut in the examples, the 8 is present in the output. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is replaced with a cross of 1s, but the 8 is kept. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAnother idea: the 8s in the input are the centers of a cross that is 3x3, but expanded. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with the best possible hypothesis, even if it doesn't fit all examples. \n\nThe code above would set all cells to the right and below to 1, but this may not fit the examples. However, it's the best I can do. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is replaced with a cross of 1s in all directions, but only for a certain number of cells. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. \n\nSo, I'll proceed with the code that for each 8 in the input, sets all cells to the right in the same row to 1, and all cells below in the same column to 1, and leaves the 8 as is. \n\nThis is the best I can do, given the examples.\n"

I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 8s in certain positions, and the output has 8s and 1s around them. For instance, in the second row of the input, there's an 8 in the 4th column. The output for that row has an 8 in the same position, but then a bunch of 1s around it. Wait, in the output row 2, the 8 is at column 3 (if we start counting from 0?), and then there are 1s from column 4 to 14. Hmm, maybe that's a horizontal line of 1s expanding from the 8?\n\nLooking at the third row of the input, there's an 8 in column 15 (assuming 0-based indexing). The output for that row has an 8 in column 15, but also a 1 in column 1 (maybe?), and then another 8 in column 15. Wait, the output row 3 is 0 0 0 1 0 0 ... 8 0 0 0. So maybe the 8 is at column 15, and there's a 1 in column 3. Then in the fourth row of the output, there's a 1 in column 3, and then in the next rows, there's a 1 in column 3 and then 1s in other positions. \n\nWait, maybe the 8s in the input are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3 (assuming rows are 0-based). The output for that row has an 8 in the same position, but then a horizontal line of 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in the third row, there's an 8 in column 15, and the output has a 1 in column 3, and then in the fourth row, there's a 1 in column 3. So maybe the 8s are being replaced with a cross, but only in certain positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are acting as centers for expanding 1s. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in the same position, but then a horizontal line of 1s. Then, in row 2, the 8 is in column 3, but the output has 8 in column 3 and then 1s around it. Wait, maybe the 8s are being replaced with a cross shape, but the 8s themselves are kept in the output. \n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has an 8 in column 3, and then 1s around it. Also, there's an 8 in row 6, column 2 (assuming 0-based). The output for that row has an 8 in column 2, and then 1s around it. So maybe whenever there's an 8 in the input, it's replaced with a cross of 1s, but the 8 is kept in the output? Or maybe the 8 is part of the cross?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of regions where 1s are spread out. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output has 8 in that position, but then a horizontal line of 1s from column 4 to 14. Also, in row 2, the output has 1s in column 3 and 1s in columns 4-14. Wait, maybe the 8 is the center of a cross shape, but only in certain directions. \n\nAnother thing to note: in Example 1, the output for row 8 has an 8 in column 9 (assuming the input row 8 has an 8 in column 9?), and then the output has 8 in that position, but also 1s in columns 8 and 10. Wait, maybe the 8 is replaced with a cross, but the 8 is kept in the output. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of expanding regions. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has an 8 in the same position, and then 1s in columns 4 to 14. Then, in the next rows, the 8 is in column 15, and the output has 1s in columns 3 and 15. \n\nWait, perhaps the 8s in the input are the centers of a cross shape. So, for each 8 in the input, we create a cross of 1s in the output. But the 8 itself remains. However, in Example 1, the output for row 1 has 8 in column 3, but then 1s from column 4 to 14. That's a horizontal line. Then, in row 2, the output has 1s in column 3. So maybe the cross is vertical and horizontal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross, but only in certain directions. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has a horizontal line of 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in row 2, the output has a 1 in column 3. So that's a vertical line. So maybe the cross is a horizontal and vertical line. \n\nBut how does that work? Let's think about the positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, and then a horizontal line of 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in row 2, the output has 1 in column 3, and then in row 3, the output has 1 in column 3. So that's a vertical line of 1s from row 2 to row 7 (since in row 7, the output has 1 in column 3). Then, in row 8, the output has 1s in column 3 and 15. \n\nWait, maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of a cross that expands in all directions. But the 8 is kept as is. However, in the output, the 8 is present, but the surrounding cells are filled with 1s. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 8 in the same position as the input. So maybe the 8 is not changed, but the surrounding cells are filled with 1s. However, in Example 2, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3, and the output has 8 in that position, but then 1s around it. \n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, then 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in row 2, the output has 1 in column 3 and 1s from column 4 to 14. Similarly, in row 3, the output has 1 in column 3 and 1s from column 4 to 14. Wait, no, looking at the output for Example 1:\n\nRow 2 of output is 0 0 0 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So the 8 is in column 3, then 1s from column 4 to 14. Then row 3 of output is 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ... 8 0 0 0. So in row 3, column 3 is 1, and column 15 is 8. \n\nHmm, maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of a cross that expands in all directions. For example, the 8 in row 1, column 3 is the center of a horizontal line (from column 4 to 14) and a vertical line (from row 2 to row 7, column 3). Then, in row 8, the 8 is in column 9 (assuming that's where the input has an 8?), and the output has 8 in column 9, but then 1s in columns 8 and 10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of regions where 1s are spread out in certain directions. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, and then 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in the rows below, there's a vertical line of 1s in column 3. \n\nSo perhaps the transformation is: for each 8 in the input, create a cross shape of 1s in the output. But the 8 itself remains. However, in some cases, the 8 is part of the cross. \n\nBut how to model this? Maybe for each 8 in the input grid, we expand it into a cross shape. For example, for each 8 at (row, col), we set all cells in the same row (from col-1 to col+1) and same column (from row-1 to row+1) to 1. But wait, in Example 1, the 8 in row 1, column 3 has 1s from column 4 to 14. That's a horizontal line. So maybe the 8 is the center of a horizontal line and a vertical line. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is the center of a horizontal line that extends to the left and right, and a vertical line that extends up and down. But in Example 1, the 8 in row 1, column 3 has 1s from column 4 to 14. That's a horizontal line to the right. But why not left? Because in the input, there's an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, then 1s from column 4 to 14. So maybe the horizontal line is only to the right. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of a cross that expands in all directions, but the 8 is kept as is. However, in the output, the 8 is replaced with 1s. But in Example 1, the 8 is present in the output. \n\nThis is confusing. Let me look at Example 2. The input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, then 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in row 2, the output has 1 in column 3, and then 1s from column 4 to 14. So that's a vertical line. \n\nWait, maybe the 8 is the center of a cross that expands in all directions. So for each 8 in the input, we create a cross in the output. The cross is made of 1s, and the 8 is kept. But how to determine the size of the cross? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of regions where 1s are spread out in certain directions. For example, in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, and then 1s from column 4 to 14 (so to the right). Then, in the rows below, there's a vertical line of 1s in column 3. So that's a vertical line from row 2 to row 7. \n\nThis suggests that for each 8 in the input, the output has a horizontal line to the right and a vertical line downward. But why not left or up? \n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has an 8 in row 1, column 8. The output for that row has 8 in column 8, and then 1s from column 9 to 14. Then, in the next rows, there's a vertical line of 1s in column 8. \n\nBut in Example 3, there's also an 8 in row 6, column 2. The output for that row has 8 in column 2, and then 1s in column 3 and 1s in column 15. \n\nHmm, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross that expands in the right and down directions. But how to determine the exact positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross that expands in the right and down directions, but the cross is of a certain size. For example, in Example 1, the 8 in row 1, column 3 has a horizontal line of 1s from column 4 to 14 (so 11 cells), and a vertical line from row 2 to row 7 (so 6 rows). \n\nBut how to model this in code. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 8s are in the input and see what's happening in the output. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s in positions:\n\nRow 1, column 3 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's check the input and output. For example, in Example 1's input, the second row (row 1 if 0-based) is:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n\nSo the 8 is at column 3 (assuming 0-based). The output for that row is:\n\n0 0 0 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 \n\nSo the 8 is at column 3, and then 1s from column 4 to 14 (so 11 cells). \n\nThen, in row 2 of the output, the 8 is in column 3, but the output is:\n\n0 0 0 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 \n\nWait, no, row 2 of the output is the second row. Let me check the example again. \n\nExample 1's output is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s\nRow 1: 0 0 0 8 1 1 ... 1 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 1 0 ... 8 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 1 0 ... 1 0 0 0\n... and so on.\n\nSo for the input's 8 in row 1, column 3, the output has a horizontal line of 1s from column 4 to 14 (so 11 cells). Then, in row 2, column 3 is 1. Then in row 3, column 3 is 1. And so on, until row 7, where column 3 is 1. Then row 8 has 1 in column 3 and 15. \n\nSo the vertical line is from row 2 to row 7 (rows 2-7 inclusive?), and the horizontal line is from column 4 to 14. \n\nSo perhaps the 8 is the center of a cross that extends to the right and down. \n\nBut how to model this. For each 8 in the input, we need to expand it into a cross that extends to the right and down. \n\nBut then, in Example 3, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 8. The output for that row has 8 in column 8, then 1s from column 9 to 14. Then, in the next rows, there's a vertical line of 1s in column 8. \n\nSo for each 8, we expand to the right and down. \n\nBut how to determine the range. For example, in Example 1, the horizontal line is from column 4 to 14 (so 11 cells). The vertical line is from row 2 to row 7 (6 rows). \n\nBut how to determine the exact positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is such that the horizontal line starts at column 3+1 (so column 4) and extends to the right until the end of the row. Similarly, the vertical line starts at row 1+1 (row 2) and extends down until the end of the grid. \n\nBut in Example 1, the horizontal line is from column 4 to 14 (so 11 columns). The row has 20 columns (since the output is 10x20). \n\nBut in that case, for each 8 in the input, the horizontal line would be from column (col+1) to the end of the row. And the vertical line would be from row (row+1) to the end of the grid. \n\nBut then, in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 3. So the vertical line would be from row 2 to row 9 (since the output is 10 rows). But in the output, the vertical line is from row 2 to row 7. \n\nHmm, that doesn't match. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is from row (row+1) to row (row+5). But that's arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is such that the horizontal line is from column (col) to the right, but only a certain number of cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is determined by the position of the 8. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in the second row (row 1), and the vertical line is from row 2 to row 7 (so 6 rows). \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is the center of a cross that expands in all four directions, but the 8 is kept as is. But in the output, the 8 is present, and the surrounding cells are filled with 1s. \n\nBut in Example 1, the 8 is present in the output. So perhaps the 8 is not changed, but the surrounding cells are filled with 1s. \n\nBut how to determine which cells are filled with 1s. \n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, and then 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in row 2, column 3 is 1. So that's a vertical line from row 2 to row 7. \n\nSo for each 8 in the input, the output has a horizontal line to the right (from column+1 to end of row), and a vertical line downward (from row+1 to end of grid). \n\nBut that would mean that for an 8 in row r, column c, the output for that row would have 1s from c+1 to 19 (since the grid is 20 columns), and for each row below r, column c would be 1. \n\nBut in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 3. The output for row 1 has 1s from column 4 to 19 (but in the output, the row is 0 0 0 8 1 1 ... 1 0 0 0. So the 1s go from column 4 to 14, and then 0s. Wait, but the output is 20 columns. So maybe the horizontal line is from column 4 to 14, but not all the way to the end. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern where for each 8 in the input, we create a cross that extends to the right and down, but only for a certain number of cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross that expands in the right and down directions, but the cross is of a certain size. For example, in Example 1, the horizontal line is 11 cells long (from column 4 to 14), and the vertical line is 6 rows long (from row 2 to row 7). \n\nBut how to determine the exact positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is determined by the position of the 8. For example, if the 8 is in the first row (row 0), then the vertical line is from row 1 to row 5. But this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross is such that for each 8 in the input, the output has 1s in the same row, starting from column+1 to column+5 (for example), and in the same column, starting from row+1 to row+5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nLooking at Example 2: the input has an 8 in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, then 1s from column 4 to 14 (so 11 cells). Then, in row 2, column 3 is 1. In row 3, column 3 is 1. In row 4, column 3 is 1. In row 5, column 3 is 1. In row 6, column 3 is 1. In row 7, column 3 is 0. \n\nWait, the output for Example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s\nRow 1: 0 0 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\nRow 7: all 0s\n\nSo for the 8 in row 1, column 3, the output has 1s in row 1, columns 4-10 (since the row is 12 columns?), and in row 2, column 3 is 1. Then in row 3, column 3 is 1. Row 4, column 3 is 1. Row 5, column 3 is 1. Row 6, column 3 is 8. \n\nSo the vertical line is from row 2 to row 5 (rows 2-5). \n\nHmm, this is inconsistent with Example 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of a cross that extends in certain directions. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 3. The output has a horizontal line to the right (from column 4 to 14) and a vertical line down (from row 2 to row 7). \n\nIn Example 2, the 8 is in row 1, column 3. The output has a horizontal line to the right (columns 4 to 10) and a vertical line down (rows 2 to 5). \n\nIn Example 3, the 8 is in row 1, column 8. The output has a horizontal line to the right (columns 9 to 14) and a vertical line down (rows 2 to 9). \n\nSo perhaps for each 8 in the input, the horizontal line extends to the right for a certain number of columns, and the vertical line extends down for a certain number of rows. \n\nBut how to determine the number of columns and rows. \n\nLooking at Example 1: the horizontal line is 11 columns (from 4 to 14). The vertical line is 6 rows (from 2 to 7). \n\nExample 2: horizontal line is 7 columns (from 4 to 10), vertical line is 4 rows (from 2 to 5). \n\nExample 3: horizontal line is 6 columns (from 9 to 14), vertical line is 8 rows (from 2 to 9). \n\nThis seems inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line extends to the right until the end of the row, but only for a certain number of columns. But how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from column+1 to column+5, and the vertical line is from row+1 to row+5. \n\nIn Example 1: column 3 + 1 = 4, column+5 = 8. But the horizontal line in Example 1 is from 4 to 14, which is much longer. So that doesn't fit. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the 8 as a center, and the output has 1s in the same row and column, but only in certain directions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replaced with 1s in the output, but the 8s themselves are kept. But that doesn't fit the examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross where the horizontal line is to the right and the vertical line is downward. But the length of the cross depends on the position. \n\nAnother idea: look at the positions where the 8s are in the input and see what their output is. For example, in Example 1, the 8 in row 1, column 3 has a horizontal line of 1s from column 4 to 14 (11 columns), and a vertical line from row 2 to row 7 (6 rows). \n\nIn Example 2, the 8 in row 1, column 3 has a horizontal line from 4 to 10 (7 columns), and vertical line from row 2 to 5 (4 rows). \n\nIn Example 3, the 8 in row 1, column 8 has a horizontal line from 9 to 14 (6 columns), and vertical line from row 2 to 9 (8 rows). \n\nSo perhaps the horizontal line length is 11, 7, 6, depending on the position. But how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from column+1 to column+10 (so 10 columns), but in Example 1, that would be 3+1=4 to 3+10=13, but the example has 14. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from column+1 to column+14 (but that would be way beyond the grid). \n\nThis is not working. Maybe I need to think of another approach. \n\nLet me think about the output for the input. For each cell in the input, if it's an 8, then in the output, it's replaced with a cross of 1s. But how. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross that is 3x3, but expanded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross that extends in all directions, but the 8 is kept. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 8 in the same position, and the surrounding cells are 1s. \n\nWait, for example, in row 1 of Example 1, the output has 8 in column 3, and then 1s from 4 to 14. So that's a horizontal line. In the same row, the 8 is at column 3, and the next cells are 1s. \n\nBut in the same row, the 8 is in the middle of the horizontal line. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each 8 in the input, the output has a horizontal line of 1s extending to the right from the 8, and a vertical line of 1s extending downward from the 8. \n\nSo, for each 8 at (r, c), in the output grid, for all columns from c+1 to 19 (the end of the row), set to 1. Also, for all rows from r+1 to 9 (the end of the grid), set the cell at column c to 1. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the 8 is at row 1, column 3. So the horizontal line would be from column 4 to 19, but in the output, it's only from 4 to 14. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from c+1 to c+10 (for example), and the vertical line is from r+1 to r+5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from c to c+10, and the vertical line is from r to r+10. But again, this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8 in the input is the center of a cross that extends to the right and down, but the length of the cross is determined by the distance from the edge. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 3. The horizontal line extends to the right until column 14 (which is 14-3 = 11 columns to the right). But why 11? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line extends for 10 columns to the right, and the vertical line extends for 6 rows down. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the output. \n\nIn Example 1, the output has 8s in the same positions as the input, but with 1s around them. For example, the 8 in row 1, column 3 is kept, and then the cells to the right are 1s. \n\nIn Example 2, the 8 in row 1, column 3 is kept, and the cells to the right are 1s. \n\nIn Example 3, the 8 in row 1, column 8 is kept, and the cells to the right are 1s. \n\nSo perhaps the transformation is: for each 8 in the input, in the output, the cell is kept as 8, and all cells to the right of it in the same row are set to 1, and all cells below it in the same column are set to 1. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 3. The output for that row has 8 in column 3, then 1s from column 4 to 14. Then, in row 2, column 3 is 1. \n\nSo that would mean that for each 8 in the input, in the same row, all cells to the right of the 8 are set to 1, and in the same column, all cells below the 8 are set to 1. \n\nBut what about other cells? For example, in Example 1, the cell to the left of the 8 is 0 in the input, but in the output it's 0. So that's not changed. \n\nSo the transformation is: for each 8 in the input, set all cells to the right in the same row to 1, and all cells below in the same column to 1. \n\nBut what about other cells? For example, in Example 1, the cell in row 2, column 4 is 1. But why? Because it's to the right of the 8 in row 1, column 3? Or because it's below the 8 in row 1, column 3? \n\nWait, in row 2, column 3 is 1, which is below the 8 in row 1, column 3. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples. \n\nExample 1: input has 8 at (1,3). In the output, all cells to the right of (1,3) in the same row are 1. So columns 4-19 are set to 1. But in the output, it's only 4-14. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is the center of a cross that extends to the right and down, but only for a certain number of cells. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is the center of a cross that extends to the right and down, but the length is determined by the position. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in the second row (row 1), so the vertical line extends down to row 7 (6 rows), and the horizontal line extends to column 14 (11 columns). \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is determined by the position of the 8. For example, if the 8 is in the first row (row 0), then the vertical line extends down to row 5. If it's in row 1, then down to row 7, etc. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nMaybe I should think of the transformation as: for each 8 in the input, in the output, the cell is kept as 8, and all cells to the right in the same row are set to 1, and all cells below in the same column are set to 1. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output for row 1, column 3 is 8, and columns 4-14 are 1. But the row has 20 columns, so columns 4-19 would be 1, but in the output, it's only 4-14. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut perhaps the 8 is in the input, and in the output, the 8 is kept, and the cells to the right are set to 1, but only up to a certain point. \n\nMaybe the 8 is the center of a cross that extends to the right and down, but the length is determined by the distance from the edge. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the 8 is in column 3. The horizontal line extends to the right until column 14 (which is 11 columns to the right). Why 14? Maybe because it's the middle of the row. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line extends to the right for 10 columns, and the vertical line extends down for 6 rows. \n\nBut this is arbitrary. \n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for other patterns. \n\nLooking at Example 3: the input has an 8 in row 6, column 2. The output for that row has 8 in column 2, and then 1s in column 3 and 15. \n\nSo in the same row, the 8 is at column 2, and to the right is column 3 (1), and to the left is 0. \n\nIn the vertical direction, the 8 is in row 6, column 2. The output for row 7 has 1 in column 2. \n\nSo perhaps for each 8 in the input, the output has 1s to the right in the same row, and 1s below in the same column. \n\nBut in Example 3, the 8 is in row 6, column 2. The output for row 6 has 1 in column 3, and for row 7, column 2 is 1. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 3. The output for row 1 has 1s from column 4 to 14. But why not all the way to the end? \n\nMaybe the horizontal line extends to the right until the end of the row, but in Example 1, the output has 1s only up to column 14. \n\nThis suggests that the horizontal line is not extending to the end. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from column+1 to column+10, and the vertical line is from row+1 to row+5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from column+1 to column+10, and the vertical line is from row+1 to row+5. \n\nFor Example 1: column 3 +1 = 4, column+10 = 13. But the output has 1s up to column 14. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from column+1 to column+14, but that would be way beyond the grid. \n\nThis is not helpful. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on what I can see. \n\nThe pattern seems to be: for each 8 in the input, the output has a horizontal line of 1s to the right, and a vertical line of 1s downward. The 8 itself is kept. \n\nSo, for each 8 at (r, c), in the output, set all cells in the same row, from c+1 to the end of the row, to 1. Also, set all cells in the same column, from r+1 to the end of the column, to 1. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output for row 1 has 1s from column 4 to 14, but not all the way to the end. So this suggests that this hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nBut maybe the output is 10x20, and in Example 1, the row is 20 columns. So for row 1, column 3, the horizontal line would be from column 4 to 19 (16 columns), but in the output, it's only from 4 to 14. \n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from c+1 to c+10, and the vertical line is from r+1 to r+5. \n\nFor Example 1, c=3, so c+1=4, c+10=13. But in the output, it's up to 14. So this is not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line is from c+1 to c+11, but this is arbitrary. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that for each 8 in the input, the output has 1s to the right in the same row and below in the same column, and the 8 is kept. \n\nEven if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do. \n\nSo the plan is: \n\nFor each cell in the input grid, if it's an 8, then in the output grid, set all cells to the right in the same row to 1, and all cells below in the same column to 1. \n\nBut what about other cells? For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in row 2, column 3. This is because the 8 in row 1, column 3 has a vertical line below it. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nCreate a new grid of 10x20 filled with 0s. \n\nFor each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n\n   if the cell is 8:\n\n       for col in c+1 to 19:\n\n           set new_grid[r][col] = 1\n\n       for row in r+1 to 9:\n\n           set new_grid[row][c] = 1\n\nBut this would set all cells to the right and below to 1. \n\nLet's test this against Example 1. \n\nInput has 8 at (1,3). \n\nIn new_grid, for row 1, columns 4-19 are set to 1. \n\nFor rows 2-9, column 3 is set to 1. \n\nBut in the output, for row 1, columns 4-14 are 1, but not 15-19. So this would not match. \n\nBut perhaps the output is different. \n\nWait, in the example, the output for row 1 is:\n\n0 0 0 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 \n\nSo columns 4-14 are 1, and columns 15-19 are 0. \n\nBut according to the hypothesis, columns 4-19 should be 1. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nBut why is that? \n\nMaybe the 8 is not the only one affecting the cells. For example, other 8s in the input may also affect the cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are the centers of a cross that extends in certain directions, but the 8 is not part of the cross. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible hypothesis, even if it doesn't fit all examples. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nCreate a new grid of 10x20 filled with 0s. \n\nFor each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n\n   if the cell is 8:\n\n       for col in range(c+1, 20):\n\n           new_grid[r][col] = 1\n\n       for row in range(r+1, 10):\n\n           new_grid[row][c] = 1\n\nBut this would set all cells to the right and below to 1. \n\nLet's see what this would do for Example 1. \n\nIn the input, there's an 8 at (1,3). So in new_grid, row 1, columns 4-19 are 1. Also, rows 2-9, column 3 are 1. \n\nBut in the output for Example 1, row 1 has 1s from 4-14, and then 0s. So this would not match. \n\nSo this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nBut perhaps the 8 in the input is replaced with a cross that extends in certain directions, but not all. \n\nMaybe the horizontal line is only to the right for a certain number of columns, and the vertical line is only down for a certain number of rows. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the horizontal line is from column 4 to 14 (11 columns), and the vertical line is from row 2 to 7 (6 rows). \n\nSo for each 8, the horizontal line extends for 11 columns to the right, and the vertical line extends for 6 rows down. \n\nBut how to determine these numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line extends for 10 columns to the right, and the vertical line extends for 6 rows down. \n\nBut this is arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal line extends for 10 columns to the right, and the vertical line extends for 6 rows down, but this is just a guess. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the code that implements the hypothesis that for each 8 in the input, the output has 1s to the right and below, even if it doesn't fit all examples. \n\nBut given that the test input has an 8 in row 3, column 3 (assuming 0-based), and the output would have 1s to the right and below, but the actual output may vary. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(10)]\n    for r in range(10):\n        for c in range(20):\n            if grid[r][c] == 8:\n                # Set all to the right in the same row\n                for col in range(c+1, 20):\n                    new_grid[r][col] = 1\n                # Set all below in the same column\n                for row in range(r+1, 10):\n                    new_grid[row][c] = 1\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this would set all cells to the right and below to 1. \n\nBut in Example 1, this would set row 1, columns 4-19 to 1, which doesn't match the output. \n\nSo this suggests that this is not the correct pattern. \n\nBut perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the 8 is replaced with a cross of 1s, but the 8 itself is replaced with 1s. \n\nBut in the examples, the 8 is present in the output. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is replaced with a cross of 1s, but the 8 is kept. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAnother idea: the 8s in the input are the centers of a cross that is 3x3, but expanded. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with the best possible hypothesis, even if it doesn't fit all examples. \n\nThe code above would set all cells to the right and below to 1, but this may not fit the examples. However, it's the best I can do. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is replaced with a cross of 1s in all directions, but only for a certain number of cells. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. \n\nSo, I'll proceed with the code that for each 8 in the input, sets all cells to the right in the same row to 1, and all cells below in the same column to 1, and leaves the 8 as is. \n\nThis is the best I can do, given the examples.\n"
