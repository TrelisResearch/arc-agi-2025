          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 13x16. The input has some numbers, and the output has some numbers as well. Let me check some positions. For instance, looking at the first row of the input and output. The input's first row is 5 0 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 5. The output's first row is the same as the input's first row. Wait, but in the output, the second row has some changes. Let me check the second row of input and output. Input's second row is 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 5. The output's second row is 0 5 5 3 5 5 5 3 5 3 0 5 0 3 5 5. So in the input, the fourth element is 0, but in the output it's 3. Similarly, the eighth element is 0 in input, but 3 in output. Then the tenth element is 0 in input, 3 in output. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 3s?\n\nLooking at the input's second row, the fourth, eighth, and tenth elements are 0s. In the output, those positions are 3s. But why? Maybe there's a specific pattern of positions that get replaced. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at the third row of input: 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0. The output's third row is 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0. So no changes here. Hmm. But in the fourth row of input, the input is 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 0. The output's fourth row is 5 5 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 5 0 5 5 3. So positions 4, 6, 8, 10 are 3s. Wait, maybe the positions where there are 0s in the input are being replaced with 3s? But in the input's second row, the fourth, eighth, and tenth elements are 0s. In the output, those positions are 3s. Similarly, in the fourth row, the fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth elements are 0s in the input, but in the output they are 3s. Wait, but in the fourth row of input, the fourth element is 0, and in the output it's 3. The sixth element is 0 in input, output is 3. Same for eighth and tenth. So maybe whenever there's a 0 in the input, it's replaced with 3? But that's not the case. Let me check another row.\n\nLooking at the fifth row of input: 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0. The output's fifth row is 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0. So no changes. Wait, but in the output's second row, some positions are 3. But in the fifth row of input, there are 0s, but in the output they are same as input. So maybe that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the second row of input, the fourth element is 0, and in the output it's 3. But in the fifth row of input, the fourth element is 0, but in the output it's 0. So maybe there's a different pattern. Maybe the positions where there's a 0 in the input and the position is in a certain row or column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing certain positions based on some other pattern. Let me check the output for the second row. The output's second row has 3s in positions 4, 8, 10. Let me check the input's second row again. The input's second row is 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 5. So the fourth element is 0, eighth is 0, tenth is 0. So maybe those positions are being replaced with 3s. But why?\n\nLooking at Example 2. Let's check that. The input's fifth row is 5 5 5 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output's fifth row is 5 5 5 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 5 5. So in the input's fifth row, the fourth element is 0, and in the output it's 1. Also, the sixth element is 1, which remains 1. The seventh is 0, which becomes 1. Hmm. So maybe in some cases, 0s are being replaced with 1s or 3s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in certain positions based on some grid pattern. Let me look at the first example's output. For example, in the second row, the 3s are in positions 4, 8, 10. Let me check if these positions are in certain columns. The input is 13 rows and 16 columns. Let me check the positions:\n\nIn the second row of the input, the fourth element is column 3 (since indices start at 0?), or maybe column 4? Wait, in the input, the first row is 16 elements. Let me think of the first row as row 0, columns 0 to 15.\n\nIn the second row of input (row index 1), the fourth element is column 3. In the output, that position is 3. Similarly, the eighth element is column 7, and tenth is column 9. So positions 3,7,9. Maybe these are positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the input, if the position is in a certain row and column, maybe it's replaced with 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the sum of the row and column indices is even or something. Let me check for the second row (row index 1). For position (1,3): 1+3=4, even. (1,7): 8, even. (1,9): 10, even. So maybe that's a pattern. But then why in the fifth row of input, the fourth element is 0 and in the output it's 0. Let me check that.\n\nIn the fifth row of input (row index 4), the fourth element is column 3. 4+3=7, which is odd. So maybe that's not the case. But in the output for that row, the fourth element is 0. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions where there's a 0 in the input, and the column is even? Let me check the second row. The fourth element is column 3 (odd), but it's replaced with 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me check the second example. In Example 2, the input's fifth row is 5 5 5 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output's fifth row is 5 5 5 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 5 5. So in the input, the fourth element is 0, and in the output it's 1. The seventh element is 0, and in the output it's 1. The eighth element is 0, and output is 1. The ninth is 0, output is 1. The tenth is 0, output is 1. So in this case, the positions where there's a 0 in the input are being replaced with 1s. But in Example 1, some 0s are replaced with 3s. So that's conflicting. So maybe the replacement depends on some other factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is being replaced based on the surrounding cells. For example, if there's a 0 in the input, and there's a 3 in a certain position, then it's replaced with 3. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 1's second row, the output has 3s in positions where the input had 0s. But in Example 2's fifth row, the input has 0s, and the output replaces them with 1s. So that's inconsistent. Maybe the value depends on the row and column indices. For example, in the first example, the 3s are in certain positions. Let me check the coordinates.\n\nIn Example 1's second row (row index 1), the positions with 3s are (1,3), (1,7), (1,9). Let me check if these positions are in certain columns. For example, column 3 is 3, column 7 is 7, column 9 is 9. Maybe these are columns that are multiples of 3? 3, 7, 9. No. 3 is 3, 7 is 7, 9 is 9. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe these positions are in certain rows and columns where the sum is a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is even. For example, in the second row of Example 1, the columns 3,7,9 are odd. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions where the input has a 0 and the column is in a certain range. For example, in the first example's second row, the 0s are in columns 3, 7, 9. Let me check the input's second row. The input's second row is 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 5. So the 0s are at positions 0, 3, 7, 9, 12, 13. Wait, the first element is 0 (column 0), then column 3, 7, 9, 12, 13. But in the output, the second row has 3s at columns 3,7,9. The first element is 0, which remains 0. The 12th and 13th columns are 0 in input, but in the output they are 0 and 3. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing 0s in certain positions based on their row. For example, in the second row of the first example, the 3s are in columns 3,7,9. Maybe these are columns that are part of a certain pattern in that row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the input has a 0 and the column is in a certain range. For example, columns 3-7, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is in a certain pattern. For example, columns that are even or odd. But in the second row of example 1, columns 3,7,9 are odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the input has a 0 and the row is even. For example, in example 1, the second row is row 1 (assuming 0-based), which is odd. But the 3s are there. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me look for other patterns. For example, in example 1's output, the second row has 3s in certain positions. Also, in the third row of the input, the output is the same as the input. But in the fourth row of input, the output has 3s in certain positions. Maybe the 3s are in positions where the input has a 0 and the row is even? Or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in the second row of example 1, the 3s are in columns 3,7,9. Let me think of that as a pattern. Maybe these columns are part of a diagonal or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is 3,7,9, which are columns 3,7,9. Let me check if these columns are part of a certain pattern. For example, columns that are multiples of 3? 3 is 3, 7 is not, 9 is 3*3. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions where the input has a 0 and the column is in the range 3-9. But that's not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing 0s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, in the second row, columns 3,7,9. Let me think of the row and column indices. For row 1 (second row), column 3: 1+3=4. Column 7: 1+7=8. Column 9: 1+9=10. These are even numbers. So maybe positions where the sum of row and column is even. Let's check for example 1's second row. The sum for column 3 is 4 (even), column 7 is 8 (even), column 9 is 10 (even). So in that case, those positions are replaced with 3. But in the fifth row of example 1, the fourth column is 0, and row is 4 (assuming 0-based). 4+3=7 (odd). So that position is not replaced. But in the output for that row, the fourth column is 0, so it remains. So that seems to fit. Let's check another example. For example, in example 2's fifth row, the input is row 4 (assuming 0-based). Let's take the fourth column (column 3). Sum is 4+3=7, which is odd. But in the output for that row, the fourth column is 1. So that would not fit the pattern. Hmm. But maybe this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing 0s in positions where the column is even. Let me check example 1's second row. Columns 3,7,9 are odd. So that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is in a certain range. For example, columns 3-7, 9-11. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let me look for the 3s and 1s in the outputs. In example 2, the output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the fifth row of example 2, the fourth column is replaced with 1. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 1s or 3s based on some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is replaced based on the number of 0s in the row or column. But that's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the input has a 0 and the row is even. For example, in example 1's second row (row 1, which is odd), the 3s are there. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is in a certain pattern. For example, columns that are 3, 7, 9. Let me check if these are columns that are part of a diagonal or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing 0s in certain positions that are part of a specific pattern, like a cross or something. For example, in example 1's second row, the 3s are in columns 3,7,9. That's three positions. Maybe they form a certain shape. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the input has a 0 and the column is in a certain range. For example, columns 3,7,9 are in the middle of the row. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the input has a 0 and the column is a multiple of 3. For example, 3, 6, 9. But in example 1's second row, the 3s are in columns 3,7,9. So 3 and 9 are multiples of 3, but 7 is not. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another pattern. Let me look for other transformations. For example, in example 1's output, the second row has 3s in certain positions. In the fourth row of example 1's input, the fourth column is 0, and in the output it's 3. Similarly, the sixth, eighth, and tenth columns are 0s in the input, and replaced with 3s. So maybe the pattern is that whenever there is a 0 in the input, and the column is in a certain range, it's replaced with 3. For example, columns 3,7,9. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is even. Let me check example 1's second row. The columns 3,7,9 are odd. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the row and column indices are both even or odd. For example, row 1 (odd), column 3 (odd). Sum is even. So maybe that's the pattern. Let's check for example 1's second row. The sum of row and column for the 3 positions is even. For example, row 1, column 3: 1+3=4 even. Row 1, column 7: 8 even. Row 1, column 9: 10 even. So maybe whenever the sum of row and column is even, and the input is 0, it's replaced with 3. Let's check other positions.\n\nIn example 1's fourth row (row 3), the input has 0s in columns 3, 6, 8, 10. Let's check their sums. Row 3, column 3: 3+3=6 even. So replaced with 3. Column 6: 3+6=9 odd. But in the output, that position is 3. Wait, no. In example 1's fourth row of output, the fourth row is 5 5 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 5 0 5 5 3. So the columns with 3s are 3, 5, 7, 9. Let me check their sums. Row 3, column 3: 3+3=6 even. Column 5: 3+5=8 even. Column 7: 3+7=10 even. Column 9: 3+9=12 even. So those positions have even sums. So the pattern could be that whenever the sum of row and column is even, and the input value is 0, replace with 3. But in example 2's fifth row, the input has 0s in columns 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc. Let me check for that row. Let's say it's row 4. Let's take column 3: sum 4+3=7, which is odd. But in the output, that position is 1. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in example 2's fifth row, the output has 1s in certain positions. So maybe the replacement depends on the sum being even or odd. For example, if the sum is even, replace with 3, if odd, replace with 1. Let's check example 1's second row. For the positions where the sum is even, replace with 3. That fits. For example 2's fifth row, the input has a 0 in column 3 (sum 4+3=7, odd). So replaced with 1. That fits. Let me check another position in example 2's fifth row. The input's fifth row is 5 5 5 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output's fifth row is 5 5 5 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 5 5. So the fourth column (0) is replaced with 1. Sum is 4+3=7 (odd). The seventh column (0) is replaced with 1. Sum is 4+6=10 (even). Wait, that's conflicting. Because sum is even, but the output is 1. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the replacement is based on the sum being even or odd, but the value depends on the row. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3 if sum is even, and 1 if sum is odd. In odd rows, replace 0s with 1 if sum is even, and 3 if sum is odd. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is replaced with 3 if the sum is even and the row is even, and 1 if sum is odd and row is even. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if the sum is even, replace with 3, else replace with 1. Let's check example 1's second row. The sum for the positions with 3s is even. That fits. In example 2's fifth row, the fourth column is sum 7 (odd) and replaced with 1. The seventh column is sum 4+6=10 (even) and replaced with 1. So that doesn't fit. So that's not the pattern.\n\nHmm. Maybe the replacement is based on the sum being even, but the value depends on other factors. For example, in example 1, the sum is even and the value is 3. In example 2, the sum is even and the value is 1. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is replaced with 3 if the sum is even and the column is in a certain range. For example, columns 3, 7, 9. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is even. But in example 1's second row, columns 3,7,9 are odd. So that's not.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of another approach. Let's look for the positions where the output is different from the input. For example, in example 1's second row, the 3s are in columns 3,7,9. In the fourth row of example 1, the 3s are in columns 3,5,7,9. So maybe the pattern is that in even rows, certain columns are replaced with 3s. Or maybe in certain rows, like rows 1, 3, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions where the input has a 0 and the column is in the range 3-9, and the row is even. But in example 1's second row (row 1, which is odd), the 3s are in columns 3,7,9. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is in the range 3-9 and the row is even. But in example 1's second row (row 1, odd), the 3s are there. So that's not.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 3s are in positions that are part of a diagonal. For example, in example 1's second row, columns 3,7,9. Let me think of the row and column indices. For row 1, column 3: (1,3). For row 3, column 3: (3,3). For row 3, column 5: (3,5). For row 3, column 7: (3,7). For row 3, column 9: (3,9). These positions form a diagonal or something. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like a cross or a line. But without seeing the full grid, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is 3, 7, or 9, regardless of the row. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is 3, 7, or 9, and the row is even. But in example 1's second row, which is odd, the 3s are there. So that's not.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I should think about the test input and see if I can find any patterns. The test input has a row that starts with 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0. The output is not given, but I need to write a transformation that works for the training examples. Maybe the pattern is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 3 if it's in a certain position, and with 1 otherwise. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 if they are in certain columns, and with 1 otherwise. For example, in example 1, the 0s in columns 3,7,9 are replaced with 3. In example 2, the 0s in columns 3,7, etc., are replaced with 1. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is replaced based on the row. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3, in odd rows with 1. Let's check example 1's second row (row 1, odd). In that row, the 0s are replaced with 3. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 if the column is in the range 3-9, and with 1 otherwise. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is in the range 3-9, and the row is even. Let me check example 1's second row (row 1, odd). So that doesn't fit. So this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But since the problem requires me to write a transformation, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking back at example 1, the second row has 3s in columns 3,7,9. These are columns 3, 7, 9. Let me check if these columns are part of a certain pattern. For example, columns 3, 7, 9 are columns that are odd numbers. But in example 2, the fifth row has 0s replaced with 1s. Maybe the replacement depends on the row. For example, if the row is even, replace 0s with 3 if the column is 3,7,9; if the row is odd, replace with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is 3, 7, or 9, and the row is even. For example, in example 1's fourth row (row 3, which is odd), the 3s are in columns 3,5,7,9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 3 if the column is 3,7,9, and replaced with 1 otherwise. Let's see if that fits example 1 and 2.\n\nFor example 1's second row: columns 3,7,9 are replaced with 3. Other 0s in the row are replaced with 0. But in example 1's second row, the first element is 0, which is not replaced. The 12th and 13th columns are 0, but in the output they are 0 and 3. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in columns 3,7,9 regardless of row. Let me check example 1's fourth row. The output has 3s in columns 3,5,7,9. So column 5 is not part of 3,7,9. So that's not.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 0s with 3s in certain positions based on their column. For example, columns 3,7,9 are replaced with 3s if the input is 0. But in example 1's fourth row, the output has 3s in columns 3,5,7,9. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is 3,7,9, and the row is even. Let me check example 1's second row (row 1, odd), but it has 3s in those columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the pattern is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 3 if the column is 3,7, or 9, and replaced with 1 otherwise. But I need to write code that implements this. Let's try to code that. So, for each cell in the grid, if the value is 0, and the column is 3,7, or 9, replace with 3. Otherwise, if the value is 0, replace with 1. But let's check if this fits the examples.\n\nFor example 1's second row: columns 3,7,9 are replaced with 3. Other 0s in the row are replaced with 1. But in the output, the first element is 0, which is not replaced. The 12th and 13th columns are 0, but in the output, the 12th is 0 and 13th is 3. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the sum of row and column being even or odd. For example, if the sum is even, replace 0 with 3, else replace with 1. Let's check example 1's second row. For columns 3,7,9: sum is even (1+3=4, 1+7=8, 1+9=10). So replaced with 3. For other 0s in the row, like column 0: sum 1+0=1 (odd), replaced with 1. But in the output, the first element is 0, so this doesn't fit. So this approach is also not correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 0s with 3s in certain positions and 1s in others, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is in the range 3-9 and the row is even. Let's try that. For example 1's second row (row 1, odd), no 3s. But in the output, there are 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really difficult. Maybe the pattern is that the 3s are in positions where the column is 3,7,9, and the row is even. For example 1's fourth row (row 3, odd), but the output has 3s in those columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at the output of example 1's second row. The output is 0 5 5 3 5 5 5 3 5 3 0 5 0 3 5 5. The input's second row is 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 5. So the 3s are in positions where the input was 0, and the column is 3,7,9. So maybe the pattern is that whenever the input is 0 and the column is 3,7, or 9, replace with 3. Other 0s are replaced with 1 or left as is.\n\nBut in example 1's second row, the 12th column is 0, but in the output it's 3. So that would mean that column 12 is 3. But 12 is not 3,7,9. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are 3,7,9, and 12. But in example 1's second row, column 12 is 0, and in the output it's 3. So that would mean that columns 3,7,9,12 are replaced with 3. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are 3,7,9, and 12, but that's arbitrary.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 0s with 3s in certain positions, and 1s in others. But without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is 3,7,9, and the row is even, and 1s in other positions. But again, this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 if the column is in the range 3-9, and with 1 otherwise. Let's try that.\n\nFor example 1's second row: columns 3,7,9 are replaced with 3. Other 0s in the row (like column 0, 12, 13) are replaced with 1. But in the output, the first column is 0, so this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's second row, the 3s are in columns 3,7,9. These are columns that are 3,7,9. So maybe the pattern is to replace 0s in these columns with 3. For other columns, if the input is 0, replace with 1. Let's try that.\n\nSo, for each cell in the grid, if the value is 0, and the column is 3,7, or 9, replace with 3. Otherwise, if the value is 0, replace with 1. Let's see if this fits example 1's second row.\n\nIn example 1's second row, the input has 0 in column 0, 3,7,9,12,13. The output has 3 in columns 3,7,9. The other 0s are replaced with 1. But in the output, the first column is 0, so this doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are 3,7,9, and 12. Let me check example 1's second row. Column 12 is 0 in the input, and in the output it's 3. So that would fit. But why 12?\n\nThis is not making sense. Maybe the pattern is that the 3s are in positions where the column is 3,7,9, and the row is even. Let's check example 1's fourth row (row 3, odd). The output has 3s in columns 3,5,7,9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with a possible pattern, even if it's not perfect. Based on example 1, the 3s are in columns 3,7,9 for certain rows. Maybe the pattern is that for rows 1,3,5, etc., replace 0s in columns 3,7,9 with 3. For other rows, replace 0s with 1. Let's try that.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n    for each column in 0-15:\n        if grid[row][col] == 0:\n            if row is even:\n                replace with 1\n            else:\n                if col in [3,7,9]:\n                    replace with 3\n                else:\n                    replace with 1\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's check example 1's second row (row 1, odd). Columns 3,7,9 are replaced with 3. Other 0s are replaced with 1. But in the output, the first column is 0, which is not replaced. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are even or odd, and for even rows, replace 0s with 3 if column is 3,7,9. For odd rows, replace 0s with 1. Let's check example 1's second row (row 1, odd). So 0s are replaced with 1. But in the output, they are replaced with 3. So this is not correct.\n\nThis is very frustrating. Given that, I'll have to proceed with a possible pattern that replaces 0s with 3 in certain columns, even if it's not perfect. Maybe the pattern is to replace 0s with 3 if the column is 3,7,9, and 1 otherwise.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(16):\n            if row[col] == 0:\n                if col in {3,7,9}:\n                    new_row.append(3)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(1)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(row[col])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not fit all examples. For example, in example 1's second row, the 12th column is 0, which is not in {3,7,9}, so it would be replaced with 1. But in the output, it's 3. So this would be incorrect. But perhaps the test input has a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are 3,7,9,12. Let's try that. So, if the column is in {3,7,9,12}, replace 0 with 3, else 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 1's second row, column 12 is 0, replaced with 3. That fits. But why 12?\n\nThis is not a solid pattern, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, the code would replace 0s with 3 if the column is in [3,7,9,12], else replace with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are 3,7,9, and 12, but that's arbitrary.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s with 3 in columns 3,7,9, and 1 otherwise. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nBut looking back at example 2's fifth row, the input has 0s in columns 3,6,7,8,9. The output replaces some of them with 1. So if the code replaces 0s in columns 3,7,9 with 3, and others with 1, then in example 2's fifth row, the 0 in column 3 would be replaced with 3, but in the output it's 1. So this would be incorrect.\n\nBut given the examples, I'm not sure. Perhaps the pattern is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 3 if the column is 3,7,9, and with 1 otherwise. Even if it's not perfect, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be as follows. But I need to ensure that the output is 13x16. The function should return a 13x16 grid.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(16):\n            if row[col] == 0:\n                if col in {3,7,9}:\n                    new_row.append(3)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(1)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(row[col])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not work for all examples, but it's the best I can come up with based on the examples.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 13x16. The input has some numbers, and the output has some numbers as well. Let me check some positions. For instance, looking at the first row of the input and output. The input's first row is 5 0 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 5. The output's first row is the same as the input's first row. Wait, but in the output, the second row has some changes. Let me check the second row of input and output. Input's second row is 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 5. The output's second row is 0 5 5 3 5 5 5 3 5 3 0 5 0 3 5 5. So in the input, the fourth element is 0, but in the output it's 3. Similarly, the eighth element is 0 in input, but 3 in output. Then the tenth element is 0 in input, 3 in output. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 3s?\n\nLooking at the input's second row, the fourth, eighth, and tenth elements are 0s. In the output, those positions are 3s. But why? Maybe there's a specific pattern of positions that get replaced. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at the third row of input: 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0. The output's third row is 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0. So no changes here. Hmm. But in the fourth row of input, the input is 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 0. The output's fourth row is 5 5 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 5 0 5 5 3. So positions 4, 6, 8, 10 are 3s. Wait, maybe the positions where there are 0s in the input are being replaced with 3s? But in the input's second row, the fourth, eighth, and tenth elements are 0s. In the output, those positions are 3s. Similarly, in the fourth row, the fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth elements are 0s in the input, but in the output they are 3s. Wait, but in the fourth row of input, the fourth element is 0, and in the output it's 3. The sixth element is 0 in input, output is 3. Same for eighth and tenth. So maybe whenever there's a 0 in the input, it's replaced with 3? But that's not the case. Let me check another row.\n\nLooking at the fifth row of input: 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0. The output's fifth row is 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0. So no changes. Wait, but in the output's second row, some positions are 3. But in the fifth row of input, there are 0s, but in the output they are same as input. So maybe that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the second row of input, the fourth element is 0, and in the output it's 3. But in the fifth row of input, the fourth element is 0, but in the output it's 0. So maybe there's a different pattern. Maybe the positions where there's a 0 in the input and the position is in a certain row or column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing certain positions based on some other pattern. Let me check the output for the second row. The output's second row has 3s in positions 4, 8, 10. Let me check the input's second row again. The input's second row is 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 5. So the fourth element is 0, eighth is 0, tenth is 0. So maybe those positions are being replaced with 3s. But why?\n\nLooking at Example 2. Let's check that. The input's fifth row is 5 5 5 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output's fifth row is 5 5 5 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 5 5. So in the input's fifth row, the fourth element is 0, and in the output it's 1. Also, the sixth element is 1, which remains 1. The seventh is 0, which becomes 1. Hmm. So maybe in some cases, 0s are being replaced with 1s or 3s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in certain positions based on some grid pattern. Let me look at the first example's output. For example, in the second row, the 3s are in positions 4, 8, 10. Let me check if these positions are in certain columns. The input is 13 rows and 16 columns. Let me check the positions:\n\nIn the second row of the input, the fourth element is column 3 (since indices start at 0?), or maybe column 4? Wait, in the input, the first row is 16 elements. Let me think of the first row as row 0, columns 0 to 15.\n\nIn the second row of input (row index 1), the fourth element is column 3. In the output, that position is 3. Similarly, the eighth element is column 7, and tenth is column 9. So positions 3,7,9. Maybe these are positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the input, if the position is in a certain row and column, maybe it's replaced with 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the sum of the row and column indices is even or something. Let me check for the second row (row index 1). For position (1,3): 1+3=4, even. (1,7): 8, even. (1,9): 10, even. So maybe that's a pattern. But then why in the fifth row of input, the fourth element is 0 and in the output it's 0. Let me check that.\n\nIn the fifth row of input (row index 4), the fourth element is column 3. 4+3=7, which is odd. So maybe that's not the case. But in the output for that row, the fourth element is 0. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions where there's a 0 in the input, and the column is even? Let me check the second row. The fourth element is column 3 (odd), but it's replaced with 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me check the second example. In Example 2, the input's fifth row is 5 5 5 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output's fifth row is 5 5 5 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 5 5. So in the input, the fourth element is 0, and in the output it's 1. The seventh element is 0, and in the output it's 1. The eighth element is 0, and output is 1. The ninth is 0, output is 1. The tenth is 0, output is 1. So in this case, the positions where there's a 0 in the input are being replaced with 1s. But in Example 1, some 0s are replaced with 3s. So that's conflicting. So maybe the replacement depends on some other factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is being replaced based on the surrounding cells. For example, if there's a 0 in the input, and there's a 3 in a certain position, then it's replaced with 3. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 1's second row, the output has 3s in positions where the input had 0s. But in Example 2's fifth row, the input has 0s, and the output replaces them with 1s. So that's inconsistent. Maybe the value depends on the row and column indices. For example, in the first example, the 3s are in certain positions. Let me check the coordinates.\n\nIn Example 1's second row (row index 1), the positions with 3s are (1,3), (1,7), (1,9). Let me check if these positions are in certain columns. For example, column 3 is 3, column 7 is 7, column 9 is 9. Maybe these are columns that are multiples of 3? 3, 7, 9. No. 3 is 3, 7 is 7, 9 is 9. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe these positions are in certain rows and columns where the sum is a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is even. For example, in the second row of Example 1, the columns 3,7,9 are odd. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions where the input has a 0 and the column is in a certain range. For example, in the first example's second row, the 0s are in columns 3, 7, 9. Let me check the input's second row. The input's second row is 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 5. So the 0s are at positions 0, 3, 7, 9, 12, 13. Wait, the first element is 0 (column 0), then column 3, 7, 9, 12, 13. But in the output, the second row has 3s at columns 3,7,9. The first element is 0, which remains 0. The 12th and 13th columns are 0 in input, but in the output they are 0 and 3. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing 0s in certain positions based on their row. For example, in the second row of the first example, the 3s are in columns 3,7,9. Maybe these are columns that are part of a certain pattern in that row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the input has a 0 and the column is in a certain range. For example, columns 3-7, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is in a certain pattern. For example, columns that are even or odd. But in the second row of example 1, columns 3,7,9 are odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the input has a 0 and the row is even. For example, in example 1, the second row is row 1 (assuming 0-based), which is odd. But the 3s are there. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me look for other patterns. For example, in example 1's output, the second row has 3s in certain positions. Also, in the third row of the input, the output is the same as the input. But in the fourth row of input, the output has 3s in certain positions. Maybe the 3s are in positions where the input has a 0 and the row is even? Or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in the second row of example 1, the 3s are in columns 3,7,9. Let me think of that as a pattern. Maybe these columns are part of a diagonal or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is 3,7,9, which are columns 3,7,9. Let me check if these columns are part of a certain pattern. For example, columns that are multiples of 3? 3 is 3, 7 is not, 9 is 3*3. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions where the input has a 0 and the column is in the range 3-9. But that's not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing 0s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, in the second row, columns 3,7,9. Let me think of the row and column indices. For row 1 (second row), column 3: 1+3=4. Column 7: 1+7=8. Column 9: 1+9=10. These are even numbers. So maybe positions where the sum of row and column is even. Let's check for example 1's second row. The sum for column 3 is 4 (even), column 7 is 8 (even), column 9 is 10 (even). So in that case, those positions are replaced with 3. But in the fifth row of example 1, the fourth column is 0, and row is 4 (assuming 0-based). 4+3=7 (odd). So that position is not replaced. But in the output for that row, the fourth column is 0, so it remains. So that seems to fit. Let's check another example. For example, in example 2's fifth row, the input is row 4 (assuming 0-based). Let's take the fourth column (column 3). Sum is 4+3=7, which is odd. But in the output for that row, the fourth column is 1. So that would not fit the pattern. Hmm. But maybe this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing 0s in positions where the column is even. Let me check example 1's second row. Columns 3,7,9 are odd. So that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is in a certain range. For example, columns 3-7, 9-11. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let me look for the 3s and 1s in the outputs. In example 2, the output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the fifth row of example 2, the fourth column is replaced with 1. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 1s or 3s based on some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is replaced based on the number of 0s in the row or column. But that's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the input has a 0 and the row is even. For example, in example 1's second row (row 1, which is odd), the 3s are there. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is in a certain pattern. For example, columns that are 3, 7, 9. Let me check if these are columns that are part of a diagonal or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replacing 0s in certain positions that are part of a specific pattern, like a cross or something. For example, in example 1's second row, the 3s are in columns 3,7,9. That's three positions. Maybe they form a certain shape. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the input has a 0 and the column is in a certain range. For example, columns 3,7,9 are in the middle of the row. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the input has a 0 and the column is a multiple of 3. For example, 3, 6, 9. But in example 1's second row, the 3s are in columns 3,7,9. So 3 and 9 are multiples of 3, but 7 is not. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another pattern. Let me look for other transformations. For example, in example 1's output, the second row has 3s in certain positions. In the fourth row of example 1's input, the fourth column is 0, and in the output it's 3. Similarly, the sixth, eighth, and tenth columns are 0s in the input, and replaced with 3s. So maybe the pattern is that whenever there is a 0 in the input, and the column is in a certain range, it's replaced with 3. For example, columns 3,7,9. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is even. Let me check example 1's second row. The columns 3,7,9 are odd. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the row and column indices are both even or odd. For example, row 1 (odd), column 3 (odd). Sum is even. So maybe that's the pattern. Let's check for example 1's second row. The sum of row and column for the 3 positions is even. For example, row 1, column 3: 1+3=4 even. Row 1, column 7: 8 even. Row 1, column 9: 10 even. So maybe whenever the sum of row and column is even, and the input is 0, it's replaced with 3. Let's check other positions.\n\nIn example 1's fourth row (row 3), the input has 0s in columns 3, 6, 8, 10. Let's check their sums. Row 3, column 3: 3+3=6 even. So replaced with 3. Column 6: 3+6=9 odd. But in the output, that position is 3. Wait, no. In example 1's fourth row of output, the fourth row is 5 5 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 5 0 5 5 3. So the columns with 3s are 3, 5, 7, 9. Let me check their sums. Row 3, column 3: 3+3=6 even. Column 5: 3+5=8 even. Column 7: 3+7=10 even. Column 9: 3+9=12 even. So those positions have even sums. So the pattern could be that whenever the sum of row and column is even, and the input value is 0, replace with 3. But in example 2's fifth row, the input has 0s in columns 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc. Let me check for that row. Let's say it's row 4. Let's take column 3: sum 4+3=7, which is odd. But in the output, that position is 1. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in example 2's fifth row, the output has 1s in certain positions. So maybe the replacement depends on the sum being even or odd. For example, if the sum is even, replace with 3, if odd, replace with 1. Let's check example 1's second row. For the positions where the sum is even, replace with 3. That fits. For example 2's fifth row, the input has a 0 in column 3 (sum 4+3=7, odd). So replaced with 1. That fits. Let me check another position in example 2's fifth row. The input's fifth row is 5 5 5 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output's fifth row is 5 5 5 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 5 5. So the fourth column (0) is replaced with 1. Sum is 4+3=7 (odd). The seventh column (0) is replaced with 1. Sum is 4+6=10 (even). Wait, that's conflicting. Because sum is even, but the output is 1. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the replacement is based on the sum being even or odd, but the value depends on the row. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3 if sum is even, and 1 if sum is odd. In odd rows, replace 0s with 1 if sum is even, and 3 if sum is odd. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is replaced with 3 if the sum is even and the row is even, and 1 if sum is odd and row is even. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if the sum is even, replace with 3, else replace with 1. Let's check example 1's second row. The sum for the positions with 3s is even. That fits. In example 2's fifth row, the fourth column is sum 7 (odd) and replaced with 1. The seventh column is sum 4+6=10 (even) and replaced with 1. So that doesn't fit. So that's not the pattern.\n\nHmm. Maybe the replacement is based on the sum being even, but the value depends on other factors. For example, in example 1, the sum is even and the value is 3. In example 2, the sum is even and the value is 1. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is replaced with 3 if the sum is even and the column is in a certain range. For example, columns 3, 7, 9. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is even. But in example 1's second row, columns 3,7,9 are odd. So that's not.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of another approach. Let's look for the positions where the output is different from the input. For example, in example 1's second row, the 3s are in columns 3,7,9. In the fourth row of example 1, the 3s are in columns 3,5,7,9. So maybe the pattern is that in even rows, certain columns are replaced with 3s. Or maybe in certain rows, like rows 1, 3, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions where the input has a 0 and the column is in the range 3-9, and the row is even. But in example 1's second row (row 1, which is odd), the 3s are in columns 3,7,9. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is in the range 3-9 and the row is even. But in example 1's second row (row 1, odd), the 3s are there. So that's not.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 3s are in positions that are part of a diagonal. For example, in example 1's second row, columns 3,7,9. Let me think of the row and column indices. For row 1, column 3: (1,3). For row 3, column 3: (3,3). For row 3, column 5: (3,5). For row 3, column 7: (3,7). For row 3, column 9: (3,9). These positions form a diagonal or something. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like a cross or a line. But without seeing the full grid, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is 3, 7, or 9, regardless of the row. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is 3, 7, or 9, and the row is even. But in example 1's second row, which is odd, the 3s are there. So that's not.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I should think about the test input and see if I can find any patterns. The test input has a row that starts with 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0. The output is not given, but I need to write a transformation that works for the training examples. Maybe the pattern is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 3 if it's in a certain position, and with 1 otherwise. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 if they are in certain columns, and with 1 otherwise. For example, in example 1, the 0s in columns 3,7,9 are replaced with 3. In example 2, the 0s in columns 3,7, etc., are replaced with 1. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is replaced based on the row. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3, in odd rows with 1. Let's check example 1's second row (row 1, odd). In that row, the 0s are replaced with 3. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 if the column is in the range 3-9, and with 1 otherwise. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is in the range 3-9, and the row is even. Let me check example 1's second row (row 1, odd). So that doesn't fit. So this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But since the problem requires me to write a transformation, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking back at example 1, the second row has 3s in columns 3,7,9. These are columns 3, 7, 9. Let me check if these columns are part of a certain pattern. For example, columns 3, 7, 9 are columns that are odd numbers. But in example 2, the fifth row has 0s replaced with 1s. Maybe the replacement depends on the row. For example, if the row is even, replace 0s with 3 if the column is 3,7,9; if the row is odd, replace with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is 3, 7, or 9, and the row is even. For example, in example 1's fourth row (row 3, which is odd), the 3s are in columns 3,5,7,9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 3 if the column is 3,7,9, and replaced with 1 otherwise. Let's see if that fits example 1 and 2.\n\nFor example 1's second row: columns 3,7,9 are replaced with 3. Other 0s in the row are replaced with 0. But in example 1's second row, the first element is 0, which is not replaced. The 12th and 13th columns are 0, but in the output they are 0 and 3. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in columns 3,7,9 regardless of row. Let me check example 1's fourth row. The output has 3s in columns 3,5,7,9. So column 5 is not part of 3,7,9. So that's not.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 0s with 3s in certain positions based on their column. For example, columns 3,7,9 are replaced with 3s if the input is 0. But in example 1's fourth row, the output has 3s in columns 3,5,7,9. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is 3,7,9, and the row is even. Let me check example 1's second row (row 1, odd), but it has 3s in those columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the pattern is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 3 if the column is 3,7, or 9, and replaced with 1 otherwise. But I need to write code that implements this. Let's try to code that. So, for each cell in the grid, if the value is 0, and the column is 3,7, or 9, replace with 3. Otherwise, if the value is 0, replace with 1. But let's check if this fits the examples.\n\nFor example 1's second row: columns 3,7,9 are replaced with 3. Other 0s in the row are replaced with 1. But in the output, the first element is 0, which is not replaced. The 12th and 13th columns are 0, but in the output, the 12th is 0 and 13th is 3. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the sum of row and column being even or odd. For example, if the sum is even, replace 0 with 3, else replace with 1. Let's check example 1's second row. For columns 3,7,9: sum is even (1+3=4, 1+7=8, 1+9=10). So replaced with 3. For other 0s in the row, like column 0: sum 1+0=1 (odd), replaced with 1. But in the output, the first element is 0, so this doesn't fit. So this approach is also not correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 0s with 3s in certain positions and 1s in others, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is in the range 3-9 and the row is even. Let's try that. For example 1's second row (row 1, odd), no 3s. But in the output, there are 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really difficult. Maybe the pattern is that the 3s are in positions where the column is 3,7,9, and the row is even. For example 1's fourth row (row 3, odd), but the output has 3s in those columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at the output of example 1's second row. The output is 0 5 5 3 5 5 5 3 5 3 0 5 0 3 5 5. The input's second row is 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 5. So the 3s are in positions where the input was 0, and the column is 3,7,9. So maybe the pattern is that whenever the input is 0 and the column is 3,7, or 9, replace with 3. Other 0s are replaced with 1 or left as is.\n\nBut in example 1's second row, the 12th column is 0, but in the output it's 3. So that would mean that column 12 is 3. But 12 is not 3,7,9. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are 3,7,9, and 12. But in example 1's second row, column 12 is 0, and in the output it's 3. So that would mean that columns 3,7,9,12 are replaced with 3. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are 3,7,9, and 12, but that's arbitrary.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 0s with 3s in certain positions, and 1s in others. But without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 3s are in positions where the column is 3,7,9, and the row is even, and 1s in other positions. But again, this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 if the column is in the range 3-9, and with 1 otherwise. Let's try that.\n\nFor example 1's second row: columns 3,7,9 are replaced with 3. Other 0s in the row (like column 0, 12, 13) are replaced with 1. But in the output, the first column is 0, so this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's second row, the 3s are in columns 3,7,9. These are columns that are 3,7,9. So maybe the pattern is to replace 0s in these columns with 3. For other columns, if the input is 0, replace with 1. Let's try that.\n\nSo, for each cell in the grid, if the value is 0, and the column is 3,7, or 9, replace with 3. Otherwise, if the value is 0, replace with 1. Let's see if this fits example 1's second row.\n\nIn example 1's second row, the input has 0 in column 0, 3,7,9,12,13. The output has 3 in columns 3,7,9. The other 0s are replaced with 1. But in the output, the first column is 0, so this doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are 3,7,9, and 12. Let me check example 1's second row. Column 12 is 0 in the input, and in the output it's 3. So that would fit. But why 12?\n\nThis is not making sense. Maybe the pattern is that the 3s are in positions where the column is 3,7,9, and the row is even. Let's check example 1's fourth row (row 3, odd). The output has 3s in columns 3,5,7,9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with a possible pattern, even if it's not perfect. Based on example 1, the 3s are in columns 3,7,9 for certain rows. Maybe the pattern is that for rows 1,3,5, etc., replace 0s in columns 3,7,9 with 3. For other rows, replace 0s with 1. Let's try that.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n    for each column in 0-15:\n        if grid[row][col] == 0:\n            if row is even:\n                replace with 1\n            else:\n                if col in [3,7,9]:\n                    replace with 3\n                else:\n                    replace with 1\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's check example 1's second row (row 1, odd). Columns 3,7,9 are replaced with 3. Other 0s are replaced with 1. But in the output, the first column is 0, which is not replaced. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are even or odd, and for even rows, replace 0s with 3 if column is 3,7,9. For odd rows, replace 0s with 1. Let's check example 1's second row (row 1, odd). So 0s are replaced with 1. But in the output, they are replaced with 3. So this is not correct.\n\nThis is very frustrating. Given that, I'll have to proceed with a possible pattern that replaces 0s with 3 in certain columns, even if it's not perfect. Maybe the pattern is to replace 0s with 3 if the column is 3,7,9, and 1 otherwise.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(16):\n            if row[col] == 0:\n                if col in {3,7,9}:\n                    new_row.append(3)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(1)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(row[col])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not fit all examples. For example, in example 1's second row, the 12th column is 0, which is not in {3,7,9}, so it would be replaced with 1. But in the output, it's 3. So this would be incorrect. But perhaps the test input has a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are 3,7,9,12. Let's try that. So, if the column is in {3,7,9,12}, replace 0 with 3, else 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 1's second row, column 12 is 0, replaced with 3. That fits. But why 12?\n\nThis is not a solid pattern, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, the code would replace 0s with 3 if the column is in [3,7,9,12], else replace with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are 3,7,9, and 12, but that's arbitrary.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s with 3 in columns 3,7,9, and 1 otherwise. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nBut looking back at example 2's fifth row, the input has 0s in columns 3,6,7,8,9. The output replaces some of them with 1. So if the code replaces 0s in columns 3,7,9 with 3, and others with 1, then in example 2's fifth row, the 0 in column 3 would be replaced with 3, but in the output it's 1. So this would be incorrect.\n\nBut given the examples, I'm not sure. Perhaps the pattern is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 3 if the column is 3,7,9, and with 1 otherwise. Even if it's not perfect, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be as follows. But I need to ensure that the output is 13x16. The function should return a 13x16 grid.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(16):\n            if row[col] == 0:\n                if col in {3,7,9}:\n                    new_row.append(3)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(1)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(row[col])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not work for all examples, but it's the best I can come up with based on the examples.\n"
