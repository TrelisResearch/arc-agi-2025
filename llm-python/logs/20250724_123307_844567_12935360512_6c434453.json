    "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to identify the pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n- Input has several groups of 1s, including a 3x3 square in the top-left corner and other shapes\n- Output shows some 1s replaced with 2s in specific patterns, particularly around the 3x3 square\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n- Similar pattern - some 1s are replaced with 2s\n- The 3x3 square of 1s in the top-left is transformed to have 2s in a cross pattern\n\nLet me examine more carefully:\n\nIn Example 1:\n- The 3x3 block of 1s at positions (0,0) to (2,2) becomes a pattern with 2s\n- It looks like the outline or border of the 3x3 block is being emphasized\n\nIn Example 2:\n- The 3x3 block of 1s at positions (0,4) to (2,6) is similarly transformed\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Identify 3x3 blocks of the same value (specifically 1s)\n2. Transform the interior or create a specific pattern with 2s\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- In both examples, it seems like 3x3 squares of 1s are being transformed to have 2s in a cross pattern or outline\n\nLet me check if it's about finding 3x3 solid blocks and replacing them with a cross pattern:\n- Center stays the same or becomes 2\n- The cross (center vertical and horizontal lines) becomes 2s\n- Or maybe it's outlining the 3x3 block\n\nActually, looking at Example 1 more carefully:\nOriginal 3x3 at top-left:\n1 1 1\n1 0 1  \n1 1 1\n\nBecomes:\n0 2 0\n2 2 2\n0 2 0\n\nThis looks like a cross pattern with 2s, with corners as 0s.\n\nIn Example 2:\nOriginal 3x3 at top-right:\n1 1 1\n1 0 1\n1 1 1\n\nBecomes:\n0 2 0\n2 2 2\n0 2 0\n\nSame pattern!\n\nSo the rule seems to be: Find 3x3 solid squares (with 1s on the border and 0 in center) and transform them to a cross pattern of 2s with 0s in corners.\n\nLet me verify this pattern and implement it:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Check each possible 3x3 region in the grid\n    for i in range(len(grid) - 2):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0]) - 2):\n            # Check if this 3x3 region matches the pattern we're looking for\n            # Pattern: border of 1s with center 0\n            if (grid[i][j] == 1 and grid[i][j+1] == 1 and grid[i][j+2] == 1 and\n                grid[i+1][j] == 1 and grid[i+1][j+1] == 0 and grid[i+1][j+2] == 1 and\n                grid[i+2][j] == 1 and grid[i+2][j+1] == 1 and grid[i+2][j+2] == 1):\n                \n                # Transform to cross pattern with 2s\n                result[i][j] = 0     # top-left corner\n                result[i][j+1] = 2   # top-middle\n                result[i][j+2] = 0   # top-right corner\n                result[i+1][j] = 2   # middle-left\n                result[i+1][j+1] = 2 # center\n                result[i+1][j+2] = 2 # middle-right\n                result[i+2][j] = 0   # bottom-left corner\n                result[i+2][j+1] = 2 # bottom-middle\n                result[i+2][j+2] = 0 # bottom-right corner\n    \n    return result\n```",

Looking at the output patterns more carefully:\n\nIn Example 1 output, I can see a cross of 2s at positions that roughly align with 3x3 regions in the input.\n\nIn Example 2 output, similar pattern.\n\nLet me try a different approach - maybe the algorithm detects 3x3 neighborhoods and if they meet certain criteria, transforms them into a cross of 2s.\n\nActually, let me check if there's a pattern where 3x3 squares that form a plus sign are being highlighted:\n\nIn Example 1, input around (1,1):\n```\n1 1 1\n1 0 1\n1 1 1\n```\nThis is a 3x3 square with center 0 - not quite a cross.\n\nIn Example 2, input around (1,4):\n```\n1 1 1\n1 0 1\n1 1 1\n```\nSame pattern.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right either, as there are other similar patterns not transformed.\n\nLet me look for actual cross patterns:\nIn Example 1 input:\nPosition (6,3) to (8,5):\n```\n0 1 0\n0 1 0\n0 1 0\n```\nThis is a vertical line, not a cross.\n\nLet me try to identify where the 2s appear in the output and trace back to the input.\n\nLooking more systematically:\nIn Example 1 output, 2s form crosses at:\n- Around position (1,1): \n  ```\n  0 2 0\n  2 2 2\n  0 2 0\n  ```\n  \nIn Example 2 output, 2s form crosses at:\n- Around position (1,5):\n  ```\n  0 2 0\n  2 2 2\n  0 2 0\n  ```\n\nSo it seems like 3x3 crosses of 2s are being placed where there are 3x3 patterns in the input that meet some criteria.\n\nLooking at the input locations where crosses appear:\nExample 1: Around (1,1) in input we have:\n```\n1 1 1\n1 0 1  \n1 1 1\n```\n\nExample 2: Around (1,5) in input we have:\n```\n1 1 1\n1 0 1\n1 1 1\n```\n\nThis looks like a consistent pattern! When there's a 3x3 square of 1s with a 0 in the center, it gets transformed into a cross of 2s.\n\nLet me verify this more carefully:\n\nExample 1: At position (1,1) to (3,3) in input:\n```\nRow 1: 1 1 1\nRow 2: 1 0 1\nRow 3: 1 1 1\n```\nYes, that's exactly a 3x3 square of 1s with 0 in center.\n\nExample 2: At position (1,5) to (3,7) in input:\nRow 1: 1 1 1\nRow 2: 1 0 1\nRow 3: 1 1 1\nYes, same pattern.\n\nThere's also another one in Example 1 around (6,4) to (8,6):\nRow 6: 0 1 0\nRow 7: 0 1 0\nRow 8: 0 1 0\n\nWait, that's a vertical line of 1s, not the cross pattern.\n\nLet me check Example 2 for additional patterns:\nThere's another one around (5,1) to (7,3):\nRow 5: 0 1 0\nRow 6: 1 1 1\nRow 7: 0 1 0\n\nYes! That's the cross pattern again.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n1. Find 3x3 regions that form a cross pattern of 1s (center can be anything, edges are 1s in cross shape)\n2. Replace with a cross of 2s\n\nActually, let me recheck:\nThe cross pattern is:\n```\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 1 0\n```\n\nOr just:\n```\n  1\n1 1 1\n  1\n```\n\nNo, the actual cross pattern in output is:\n```\n0 2 0\n2 2 2\n0 2 0\n```\n\nSo I need to find 3x3 regions in input that match:\n```\n0 1 0\n1 ? 1\n0 1 0\n```\nor\n```\n  1\n1 ? 1\n  1\n```\nwhere ? can be anything.\n\nLet me check this hypothesis:\n\nExample 1: At (1,1) - (3,3):\nInput:\n```\n1 1 1  (positions (0,0) to (0,2) in the full grid)\n1 0 1  (positions (1,0) to (1,2))\n1 1 1  (positions (2,0) to (2,2))\n```\n\nThis doesn't match exactly. The pattern I'm looking for would be:\nCenter at (1,1), checking neighbors:\n- Up: (0,1) = 1\n- Down: (2,1) = 1  \n- Left: (1,0) = 1\n- Right: (1,2) = 1\n- Center: (1,1) = 0\n\nThis matches the cross pattern! So the rule is:\nFind cells that have 1s in all 4 adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) and transform the 3x3 neighborhood into a cross of 2s.\n\nLet me verify with other instances:\n\nExample 1: At (6,4) - (8,6) with center at (7,5):\n- Up: (6,5) = 0 - No, this doesn't work.\n\nWait, let me be more careful about coordinates. In Example 1, there's a cross of 2s around position (7,5) in the output:\n```\n0 2 0  (row 6, cols 4,5,6)\n0 2 0  (row 7, cols 4,5,6)  \n0 2 0  (row 8, cols 4,5,6)\n```\n\nActually, that's a vertical line, not a cross. And it's:\n```\n0 2 0\n0 2 0\n0 2 0\n```\n\nBut that doesn't match the cross pattern I identified. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking at Example 1 output again:\nPositions with 2s:\n- (0,1) \n- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n- (2,1)\n\nThat's the cross pattern.\n\nAnd:\n- (6,5)\n- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) \n- (8,5)\n\nAnother cross!\n\nLet me check input around (7,5):\nPositions in input grid:\n- (6,5) = 0\n- (7,4) = 1, (7,5) = 1, (7,6) = 0\n- (8,5) = 1\n\nSo we have:\n```\n  0\n1 1 0\n  1\n```\n\nThis is not a complete cross.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I should look for 3x3 regions where the perimeter forms a cross shape.\n\nActually, let me step back and think of this more systematically.\n\nThe output cross patterns are always:\n```\n0 2 0\n2 2 2\n0 2 0\n```\n\nSo I",

Identify 3x3 blocks of the same value (specifically 1s)\n2. Transform the interior or create a specific pattern with 2s\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- In both examples, it seems like 3x3 squares of 1s are being transformed to have 2s in a cross pattern or outline\n\nLet me check if it's about finding 3x3 solid blocks and replacing them with a cross pattern:\n- Center stays the same or becomes 2\n- The cross (center vertical and horizontal lines) becomes 2s\n- Or maybe it's outlining the 3x3 block\n\nActually, looking at Example 1 more carefully:\nOriginal 3x3 at top-left:\n1 1 1\n1 0 1  \n1 1 1\n\nBecomes:\n0 2 0\n2 2 2\n0 2 0\n\nThis looks like a cross pattern with 2s, with corners as 0s.\n\nIn Example 2:\nOriginal 3x3 at top-right:\n1 1 1\n1 0 1\n1 1 1\n\nBecomes:\n0 2 0\n2 2 2\n0 2 0\n\nSame pattern!\n\nSo the rule seems to be: Find 3x3 solid squares (with 1s on the border and 0 in center) and transform them to a cross pattern of 2s with 0s in corners.\n\nLet me verify this pattern and implement it:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Check each possible 3x3 region in the grid\n    for i in range(len(grid) - 2):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0]) - 2):\n            # Check if this 3x3 region matches the pattern we're looking for\n            # Pattern: border of 1s with center 0\n            if (grid[i][j] == 1 and grid[i][j+1] == 1 and grid[i][j+2] == 1 and\n                grid[i+1][j] == 1 and grid[i+1][j+1] == 0 and grid[i+1][j+2] == 1 and\n                grid[i+2][j] == 1 and grid[i+2][j+1] == 1 and grid[i+2][j+2] == 1):\n                \n                # Transform to cross pattern with 2s\n                result[i][j] = 0     # top-left corner\n                result[i][j+1] = 2   # top-middle\n                result[i][j+2] = 0   # top-right corner\n                result[i+1][j] = 2   # middle-left\n                result[i+1][j+1] = 2 # center\n                result[i+1][j+2] = 2 # middle-right\n                result[i+2][j] = 0   # bottom-left corner\n                result[i+2][j+1] = 2 # bottom-middle\n                result[i+2][j+2] = 0 # bottom-right corner\n    \n    return result\n```",
