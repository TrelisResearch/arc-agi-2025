Let's verify this hypothesis:\n\nIn Example 1, the maximum value in the input is 8, but the output is filled with 4. This contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nLooking more closely, I notice that in all examples, the output grid is filled with the value that appears most frequently in the input grid. Let's verify this:\n\nExample 1:\nInput values: 4, 4, 8, 6, 4, 3, 6, 3, 0\nMost frequent value: 4 (appears 3 times)\nOutput: all 4s\n\nExample 2:\nInput values: 6, 8, 9, 1, 8, 1, 9, 4, 9\nMost frequent value: 9 (appears 3 times)\nOutput: all 9s\n\nExample 3:\nInput values: 4, 6, 9, 6, 4, 1, 8, 8, 6\nMost frequent value: 6 (appears 3 times)\nOutput: all 6s\n\nThis pattern seems to hold.
