There seems to be a transformation involving the placement of numbers in specific patterns.\n2. In Example 1, the number 1 is transformed into a cross shape with 0s around it.\n3. In Example 2, numbers like 3 and 6 are transformed into more complex patterns with 0s and other numbers.\n4. In Example 3, numbers like 1 and 4 are transformed into more complex patterns with 0s and other numbers.\n5.

The output grid always has a 12x15 size\n2. There are patterns of 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 6s, 8s, and 9s that seem to be transformed in specific ways\n3. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"spread\" or \"expansion\" of certain values\n4. There are patterns where certain values are replaced or modified in specific positions\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads certain values in a specific pattern.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 12x15 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(12)]\n    \n    # Copy the first row from input\n    transformed_grid[0] = grid[0].copy()\n    \n    # Copy the last row from input\n    transformed_grid[11] = grid[11].copy()\n    \n    # Copy the second to last row from input\n    transformed_grid[10] = grid[10].copy()\n    \n    # Copy the third to last row from input\n    transformed_grid[9] = grid[9].copy()\n    \n    # Copy the fourth to last row from input\n    transformed_grid[8] = grid[8].copy()\n    \n    # Copy the fifth to last row from input\n    transformed_grid[7] = grid[7].copy()\n    \n    # Copy the sixth to last row from input\n    transformed_grid[6] = grid[6].copy()\n    \n    # Copy the seventh to last row from input\n    transformed_grid[5] = grid[5].copy()\n    \n    # Copy the eighth to last row from input\n    transformed_grid[4] = grid[4].copy()\n    \n    # Copy the ninth to last row from input\n    transformed_grid[3] = grid[3].copy()\n    \n    # Copy the tenth to last row from input\n    transformed_grid[2] = grid[2].copy()\n    \n    # Copy the eleventh to last row from input\n    transformed_grid[1] = grid[1].copy()\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
