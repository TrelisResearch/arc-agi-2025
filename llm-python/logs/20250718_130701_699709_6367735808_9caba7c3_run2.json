          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 19x19. The input has some numbers, and the output has some numbers as well. Let me compare a few cells. For instance, looking at the first row of the input and output:\n\nInput first row: 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0\nOutput first row: same as input. So maybe the first row isn't changed. But looking at other rows, like the seventh row of input and output:\n\nInput row 7: 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row 7: 0 5 0 5 2 4 7 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\nSo here, the 6th element in input is 5, but in output it's 4. The 7th element is 5 in input, but 7 in output. Hmm. So maybe there's some transformation based on neighboring cells?\n\nAnother example: looking at the second example. Let's check the first input row and output. The input first row is 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5. The output first row is same. But in the second row of input, the input is 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 5 5 5 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 7 5 5 0 0 0. So the 13th element in input is 5, and in output it's 7. \n\nLooking at example 2's third row input: 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 5 5 2 5 5 0 5 0 0 0. Output is 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 5 5 2 4 7 0 5 0 0 0. So the 12th element in input is 2, output is 4. The 13th is 5 to 7. \n\nHmm. So maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being modified based on their neighbors. Let me think. For example, in example 1, the 6th element in row 7 (input) is 5, output is 4. Then in the same row, the 7th element is 5, output is 7. So maybe that's related to some kind of transformation based on adjacent cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced with some function of their neighbors. Let me check for example 1's row 7. The input row is:\n\n0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row is:\n\n0 5 0 5 2 4 7 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 6th element (index 5?) in input is 5, output is 4. The 7th element (index 6) is 5, output is 7. Then the 8th element (index 7) is 5, output is 5. \n\nWait, maybe the value is being changed based on some rule. For example, maybe the value is being replaced with the sum of adjacent cells divided by something? Or perhaps it's a kind of morphological operation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced with some kind of transformation based on their position. For example, in example 1, the output has some 7s and 4s. Let me check another example. In example 2, the output has 7s in certain positions. \n\nLooking at example 2's second row input: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 5 5 5 0 0 0. Output is 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 7 5 5 0 0 0. So the 13th element (index 12?) is 5 in input, becomes 7. \n\nAnother example: in example 3, input row 2 is 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 2 2 5 5 0. Output is 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 2 2 7 5 0. So the 3rd element (index 2) is 2 in input, becomes 2. The 4th element (index 3) is 5, becomes 4. The 5th element (index 4) is 5, becomes 7. \n\nHmm. It's possible that the transformation is based on some kind of local rule. For example, for each cell, the value is replaced with the sum of its neighbors, or some function of the neighbors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced with the number of certain patterns in the vicinity. For example, in example 1, the output has 4s and 7s where there are certain patterns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced with the sum of the numbers in a certain window. For example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th element (input is 5) becomes 4. Let me check the surrounding cells. The cell at (7,5) is 5. Let's see the surrounding cells. \n\nBut this might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell's value and the sum of its adjacent cells, or some similar operation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing certain values based on the presence of other numbers. For example, in example 1, the output has 4s and 7s where there are certain patterns. \n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1, the 7th row has a 4 in the 6th position (input 5) and 7 in the 7th position (input 5). Maybe that's because the cell is part of a group of cells that are being modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced by the number of adjacent cells that are 5. For example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. Let's look around it. The cell to the left is 0, right is 5, up and down? Well, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the number of times a certain value appears in its neighborhood. For example, in example 1, the output has 4 in the 6th position. Maybe that's because there are four 5s in the surrounding area. \n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output, the first row has 0 0 7 7 7 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. The input first row is 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. So the third and fourth elements (indices 2 and 3) in input are 5, but in output they are 7. So maybe that's because there are certain patterns around them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing each cell with the sum of the cell's value and the sum of its neighbors. For example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. Let's say the cell to the left is 0 (cell (7,4)), cell (7,5) is 5. The cell to the right is 5 (cell (7,6)), and the cell above and below? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output value is the sum of the cell's value and the sum of the cells in a certain pattern. But this is getting too vague. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 7th row has 4 and 7 in certain positions. Let me check the input for that row. The input row is:\n\n0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output row is:\n\n0 5 0 5 2 4 7 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 6th element (index 5) is 5 in input, becomes 4. The 7th element (index 6) is 5 in input, becomes 7. The 8th element (index 7) is 5, becomes 5. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for a cell, if it's adjacent to a certain pattern, it's modified. For example, if there's a 2 in the cell to the left, then the cell is modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the number of times a certain value appears in the row or column. \n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's row 7, the 6th element is 5. The cell to the left (index 4) is 2, and the cell to the right (index 6) is 5. Maybe the value is being replaced with the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right. For example, 2 + 5 = 7, but that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is being replaced based on the number of 5s in the surrounding cells. For example, in the 6th cell of row 7, the cell is 5. The surrounding cells (up, down, left, right) are:\n\nLeft: 0 (cell (7,4) is 0?), right: 5 (cell (7,6) is 5). Up and down? Let's assume that the cell is in the middle of the grid. But I don't know the exact positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is part of a certain pattern (like a 2 in the input), then it's replaced with a certain value. \n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2's second row input and output. The input row is 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 5 5 5 0 0 0. The output row is 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 7 5 5 0 0 0. So the 13th element (index 12) is 5 in input, becomes 7. \n\nLooking at that cell's neighbors, maybe there's a 5 in the cell above or below. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the sum of the cell's value and the value of the cell two steps to the right. But that's just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with the sum of their adjacent cells. For example, the cell (i,j) is replaced with the sum of its neighbors. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me think of another approach. \n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The first row input is 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. Output is 0 0 7 7 7 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. So the third and fourth elements (indices 2 and 3) are 5 in input, but 7 in output. \n\nLooking at the surrounding cells for these positions. Maybe these positions are part of a group where the value is increased by 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is part of a certain shape (like a line of 5s), then it's replaced with 7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on some rule. For example, in example 1, the 7th row's 6th element (5) becomes 4. The 7th element (5) becomes 7. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 4 and 7 in positions where there are certain patterns. For example, in the 7th row, the 6th and 7th elements are 5 in input, but in output, they are 4 and 7. Maybe this is related to the presence of a 2 in the cell to the left. \n\nLooking at the input row 7: the 5th element is 2. So maybe the cell to the left of the 6th element (which is 5) is 2. So the 6th element is replaced with 4 (2 + 2?), and the 7th element (5) is replaced with 7 (5 + 2). \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if there is a 2 in the cell to the left, then the current cell is replaced with some value. \n\nBut this is too speculative. \n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 7s in certain positions. Let me check if those positions are where there are 5s in the input. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 7th element (index 6) is 5 in input, becomes 7. \n\nIn example 2's second row, the 13th element (index 12) is 5 in input, becomes 7. \n\nIn example 3's second row, the 5th element (index 4) is 5 in input, becomes 7. \n\nSo maybe whenever there is a 5 in the input, it's replaced with 7 if there's a 2 in the cell to the left or something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is adjacent to a 2, then it's replaced with 7. \n\nBut in example 1's row 7, the 5th element is 2. The 6th element is 5, which is adjacent to 2. So it's replaced with 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell is replaced with the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right. For example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th element is 5. The cell to the left is 0 (cell (7,4) is 0?), and the cell to the right is 5 (cell (7,6) is 5). 0 + 5 = 5, but the output is 4. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is replaced with the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, minus something. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the 7th row's 6th element is 4. The input is 5. In example 3's second row, the 5th element is 5 in input, and becomes 7. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that whenever a cell is part of a certain pattern (like a 2 in the cell to the left), it's replaced with a certain value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the number of times a certain value appears in the entire grid. But that's unlikely. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 7th row has 4 and 7. Let's see if those numbers are related to the number of 5s in the surrounding area. For example, if there are three 5s around the cell, it's replaced with 7. \n\nBut without more data, this is hard to verify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the right, but that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced based on their position. For example, in example 1's output, the 7th row's 6th element is 4. The input is 5. Maybe this is because the cell is in a certain row and column. \n\nBut again, without more data, this is hard. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 4 and 7 in certain positions. In example 2, there are 7s in certain positions. In example 3, there are 7s as well. So maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with 4 or 7 based on some rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output value is the sum of the cell's value and the value of the cell two steps to the right. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell's value and the value of the cell to the left, but this is also a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell's value and the value of the cell to the left and the cell to the right. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 0, to the right is 5. So 5 + 0 + 5 = 10. But the output is 4. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the sum of the cell's value and the value of the cell two steps to the right. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell two steps to the right is 5 (cell 8). 5 + 5 = 10. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus the value of the cell to the right. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 0, to the right is 5. 0 + 5 = 5, but output is 4. Not matching. \n\nHmm. This is challenging. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. \n\nLooking at example 3's output, the first row has 7s in the third and fourth positions. The input first row has 5s in those positions. So maybe the transformation is that if the cell is part of a group of 5s, then it's replaced with 7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the number of times a certain value appears in the row. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is part of a certain shape, like a line of 5s, then it's replaced with 7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position relative to other cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the number of 5s in the entire grid. But that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the 7th row's 6th element is 4. The input is 5. The cell to the left is 0, and the cell to the right is 5. Maybe the cell is replaced with the sum of the left and right cells minus 1. 0 + 5 = 5 - 1 = 4. That fits. \n\nThen for the 7th element (index 6), the cell to the left is 5 (index 5 is 4?), wait no. Let me recheck. \n\nWait, in example 1's row 7, the input is:\n\n0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 6th element (index 5) is 5, the 7th element (index 6) is 5. \n\nIf the rule is that the cell is replaced with the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, minus 1. \n\nFor the 6th element (index 5), the left is 2 (index 4), and the right is 5 (index 6). So 2 + 5 = 7 - 1 = 6? But the output is 4. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, minus something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell is replaced with the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, but divided by 2. \n\nFor the 6th element (index 5), the left is 2, right is 5. 2 + 5 = 7, divided by 2 is 3.5, but output is 4. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, but rounded down. 7 becomes 7. No. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, but if the sum is even, it's divided by 2, else it's the same. \n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the right, but that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's row 7, the 6th element becomes 4. The cell to the left is 2 (index 4). Maybe the cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus 2. 2 + 2 = 4. That fits. \n\nThen for the 7th element (index 6), the cell to the left is 4 (index 5), so 4 + 3 = 7? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus 2. But why? \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th element is 5. The cell to the left is 2. So 2 + 2 = 4. That fits. The 7th element is 5. The cell to the left is 4 (from the previous cell's output?), but that's not the input. \n\nHmm, this seems like a possible pattern. But how to generalize this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell is part of a certain pattern. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 4 and 7 in certain positions. In example 2, the output has 7 in the 13th position. In example 3, the output has 7 in the 5th position. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is part of a group of 5s, then it's replaced with 7. But how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus the value of the cell to the right, divided by 2. \n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of a different approach. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the 7th row has 4 and 7. Let's see what happens if the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the value of the cell to the left plus 2. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 2. 2 + 2 = 4. That fits. The 7th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 4 (from the previous cell's output). 4 + 2 = 6, but the output is 7. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus 3. For the 6th cell, 2 + 3 = 5. No, but the output is 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell is in a certain position. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus the value of the cell to the right, but only if the cell is part of a certain pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus the value of the cell to the right, but if the sum is even, it's divided by 2, else it's the same. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 2, to the right is 5. Sum is 7, which is odd. So output is 7. But the output is 4. Doesn't fit. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nMaybe I should look for a different pattern. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the 7th row has 4 and 7. Let me think about the position of these cells. The 6th cell is in the middle of the row. Maybe the transformation is that for cells in certain positions, like the middle, they are replaced with a certain value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the right, but this doesn't fit. \n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to think of a general transformation that could explain some of the examples. \n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell's value and the value of the cell to the left, but this is just a guess. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 2. 5 + 2 = 7. But the output is 4. No. \n\nAlternatively, the output is the cell to the left minus 2. 2 - 2 = 0. No. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nMaybe I should think of the transformation as a kind of convolution, where each cell is replaced with the sum of its neighbors. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. Let's say the sum of the surrounding cells (up, down, left, right) is 2 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 17. But the output is 4. \n\nNo. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the neighboring cells in a certain pattern. \n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to think of the transformation as a simple rule that replaces certain values. \n\nFor example, in example 1's output, the 7th row has 4 and 7. Maybe these are the results of replacing 5 with 4 or 7 based on some condition. \n\nBut what condition? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus the value of the cell to the right, divided by 2. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The left is 2, right is 5. (2 + 5)/2 = 3.5, rounded to 4. That fits. The 7th cell is 5. The left is 4 (from the previous cell's output?), right is 5. (4 + 5)/2 = 4.5, rounded to 5. But the output is 7. No. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, divided by 2, but only if the sum is even. \n\nBut this is not working. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, but if the sum is greater than 10, it's replaced with 7. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. Left is 2, right is 5. Sum is 7. Output is 4. No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, but if the sum is greater than 5, it's replaced with 7. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that certain cells are being replaced with 4 or 7. Maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is part of a certain pattern (like a 2 in the cell to the left), then it's replaced with 4 or 7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 2. So 2 + 2 = 4. That fits. The 7th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 4 (from the previous cell's output). 4 + 2 = 6, but the output is 7. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value of the cell to the left plus 3. 2 + 3 = 5, but output is 4. No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell, the output is the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. Otherwise, it's the same as the input. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the value of the cell to the right plus 2. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the right is 5. 5 + 2 = 7, but the output is 4. No. \n\nAlternatively, the cell to the left is 2, so output is 2 + 2 = 4. \n\nThis seems to fit for the 6th cell in example 1's row 7. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell to the left is 2, then the current cell is replaced with 4. \n\nBut in example 1's row 7, the 7th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 4 (from the previous cell's output). So this would not apply. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. \n\nLooking at example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is replaced with 4, and the 7th with 7. The cell to the left of the 6th cell is 2. Maybe the transformation is that if the cell to the left is 2, then the current cell is replaced with 4. But the 7th cell's left is 4, so it's not replaced. \n\nBut why is the 7th cell replaced with 7? \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell to the left is 2, then the current cell is replaced with 4. If the cell to the left is 5, then it's replaced with 7. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is 4 if the cell to the left is 2, and 7 if the cell to the left is 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and write code that for each cell, checks the cell to the left and replaces it with 4 or 7 based on some condition. \n\nBut this is not a solid solution. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. \n\nBut this is a guess. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 2. So 2 + 2 = 4. That fits. \n\nThe 7th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 4 (from the previous cell's output). 4 + 2 = 6, but the output is 7. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut maybe the cell to the left is 5, then the current cell is replaced with 7. \n\nSo the rule is: if the cell to the left is 2, replace with 4; if the cell to the left is 5, replace with 7. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 2. So replace with 4. The 7th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 4 (from the previous cell's output). So no replacement. But the output is 7. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Given the time, I'll have to proceed with a possible solution that might not be correct but is based on the examples. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. Otherwise, the cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the right. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the right, but if the cell to the right is 5, then it's replaced with 7. \n\nBut this is also a guess. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain values based on the examples. For example, in example 1, the 7th row has 4 and 7. Maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is part of a certain pattern, it's replaced with 4 or 7. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is not reliable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus the value of the cell to the right. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. Left is 2, right is 5. 2 + 5 = 7. But the output is 4. No. \n\nAlternatively, the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus the value of the cell to the right, divided by 2. 2 + 5 = 7 / 2 = 3.5, rounded to 4. That fits. \n\nFor the 7th cell, the left is 4 (from previous cell's output), right is 5. 4 + 5 = 9 / 2 = 4.5, rounded to 5. But the output is 7. No. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's assume that the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, divided by 2, rounded down. \n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), the output is (grid[i][j-1] + grid[i][j+1]) // 2. \n\nLet's test this with example 1's row 7. \n\nFor the 6th cell (index 5), the left is 2 (index 4), right is 5 (index 6). (2 + 5)/2 = 3.5, rounded down to 3. But the output is 4. Doesn't fit. \n\nBut if it's rounded up, 3.5 becomes 4. That fits. \n\nFor the 7th cell (index 6), the left is 5 (index 5), right is 5 (index 7). (5 + 5)/2 = 5. Output is 7. No. \n\nSo this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, and if the sum is even, it's divided by 2, else it's the same. \n\nBut this is not working. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess and proceed. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. \n\nSo, for example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 2, so output is 2 + 2 = 4. \n\nFor the 7th cell, the cell to the left is 4 (from the previous cell's output), so 4 + 2 = 6, but the output is 7. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nBut maybe the transformation is that if the cell to the left is 2, then the current cell is replaced with 4. If the cell to the left is 5, then replaced with 7. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell's left is 2, so replaced with 4. The 7th cell's left is 4, so no change. But the output is 7. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to give up and write a function that replaces certain values based on the examples, even if it's not correct. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is part of a certain pattern, like a 2 in the cell to the left, it's replaced with 4. Otherwise, it's replaced with 7 if the cell to the left is 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that for each cell, checks the cell to the left and replaces it with 4 if it's 2, and 7 if it's 5. \n\nBut this is not a general solution. \n\nHowever, given the time, I'll proceed with this approach. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(19):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(19):\n            if j > 0:\n                left = grid[i][j-1]\n                if left == 2:\n                    row.append(4)\n                elif left == 5:\n                    row.append(7)\n                else:\n                    row.append(grid[i][j])\n            else:\n                row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nHowever, this might not work for all examples. For example, in example 1's row 7, the 7th cell's left is 4 (from previous cell's output), so it would append 4. But the output is 7. So this is not correct. \n\nBut given the time, this is the best I can do. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the right plus 2. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell's right is 5, so 5 + 2 = 7. But the output is 4. No. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the code that replaces certain values based on the examples, even if it's not correct. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 7th row has 4 and 7. These could be the results of replacing 5 with 4 or 7 based on the presence of a 2 in the cell to the left. \n\nSo, for each cell, if the cell to the left is 2, replace with 4. If the cell to the left is 5, replace with 7. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(19):\n        new_row = []\n        for j in range(19):\n            if j > 0:\n                left = grid[i][j-1]\n                if left == 2:\n                    new_row.append(4)\n                elif left == 5:\n                    new_row.append(7)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(grid[i][j])\n            else:\n                new_row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nThis is a possible solution, but it may not work for all examples. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The left is 2, so it becomes 4. The 7th cell is 5, left is 4, so it stays 5. But in the output, it's 7. So this is not correct. \n\nBut maybe the code is supposed to replace the current cell with 7 if the cell to the left is 5. \n\nBut in this case, the 7th cell's left is 4, so it stays 5. But the output is 7. \n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct. \n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern, so I'll proceed with this code as a possible solution, even if it's not correct.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 19x19. The input has some numbers, and the output has some numbers as well. Let me compare a few cells. For instance, looking at the first row of the input and output:\n\nInput first row: 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0\nOutput first row: same as input. So maybe the first row isn't changed. But looking at other rows, like the seventh row of input and output:\n\nInput row 7: 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row 7: 0 5 0 5 2 4 7 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\nSo here, the 6th element in input is 5, but in output it's 4. The 7th element is 5 in input, but 7 in output. Hmm. So maybe there's some transformation based on neighboring cells?\n\nAnother example: looking at the second example. Let's check the first input row and output. The input first row is 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5. The output first row is same. But in the second row of input, the input is 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 5 5 5 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 7 5 5 0 0 0. So the 13th element in input is 5, and in output it's 7. \n\nLooking at example 2's third row input: 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 5 5 2 5 5 0 5 0 0 0. Output is 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 5 5 2 4 7 0 5 0 0 0. So the 12th element in input is 2, output is 4. The 13th is 5 to 7. \n\nHmm. So maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being modified based on their neighbors. Let me think. For example, in example 1, the 6th element in row 7 (input) is 5, output is 4. Then in the same row, the 7th element is 5, output is 7. So maybe that's related to some kind of transformation based on adjacent cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced with some function of their neighbors. Let me check for example 1's row 7. The input row is:\n\n0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row is:\n\n0 5 0 5 2 4 7 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 6th element (index 5?) in input is 5, output is 4. The 7th element (index 6) is 5, output is 7. Then the 8th element (index 7) is 5, output is 5. \n\nWait, maybe the value is being changed based on some rule. For example, maybe the value is being replaced with the sum of adjacent cells divided by something? Or perhaps it's a kind of morphological operation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced with some kind of transformation based on their position. For example, in example 1, the output has some 7s and 4s. Let me check another example. In example 2, the output has 7s in certain positions. \n\nLooking at example 2's second row input: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 5 5 5 0 0 0. Output is 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 7 5 5 0 0 0. So the 13th element (index 12?) is 5 in input, becomes 7. \n\nAnother example: in example 3, input row 2 is 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 2 2 5 5 0. Output is 5 5 2 4 7 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 2 2 7 5 0. So the 3rd element (index 2) is 2 in input, becomes 2. The 4th element (index 3) is 5, becomes 4. The 5th element (index 4) is 5, becomes 7. \n\nHmm. It's possible that the transformation is based on some kind of local rule. For example, for each cell, the value is replaced with the sum of its neighbors, or some function of the neighbors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced with the number of certain patterns in the vicinity. For example, in example 1, the output has 4s and 7s where there are certain patterns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced with the sum of the numbers in a certain window. For example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th element (input is 5) becomes 4. Let me check the surrounding cells. The cell at (7,5) is 5. Let's see the surrounding cells. \n\nBut this might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell's value and the sum of its adjacent cells, or some similar operation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing certain values based on the presence of other numbers. For example, in example 1, the output has 4s and 7s where there are certain patterns. \n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1, the 7th row has a 4 in the 6th position (input 5) and 7 in the 7th position (input 5). Maybe that's because the cell is part of a group of cells that are being modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced by the number of adjacent cells that are 5. For example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. Let's look around it. The cell to the left is 0, right is 5, up and down? Well, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the number of times a certain value appears in its neighborhood. For example, in example 1, the output has 4 in the 6th position. Maybe that's because there are four 5s in the surrounding area. \n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output, the first row has 0 0 7 7 7 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. The input first row is 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. So the third and fourth elements (indices 2 and 3) in input are 5, but in output they are 7. So maybe that's because there are certain patterns around them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing each cell with the sum of the cell's value and the sum of its neighbors. For example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. Let's say the cell to the left is 0 (cell (7,4)), cell (7,5) is 5. The cell to the right is 5 (cell (7,6)), and the cell above and below? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output value is the sum of the cell's value and the sum of the cells in a certain pattern. But this is getting too vague. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 7th row has 4 and 7 in certain positions. Let me check the input for that row. The input row is:\n\n0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output row is:\n\n0 5 0 5 2 4 7 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 6th element (index 5) is 5 in input, becomes 4. The 7th element (index 6) is 5 in input, becomes 7. The 8th element (index 7) is 5, becomes 5. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for a cell, if it's adjacent to a certain pattern, it's modified. For example, if there's a 2 in the cell to the left, then the cell is modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the number of times a certain value appears in the row or column. \n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's row 7, the 6th element is 5. The cell to the left (index 4) is 2, and the cell to the right (index 6) is 5. Maybe the value is being replaced with the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right. For example, 2 + 5 = 7, but that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is being replaced based on the number of 5s in the surrounding cells. For example, in the 6th cell of row 7, the cell is 5. The surrounding cells (up, down, left, right) are:\n\nLeft: 0 (cell (7,4) is 0?), right: 5 (cell (7,6) is 5). Up and down? Let's assume that the cell is in the middle of the grid. But I don't know the exact positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is part of a certain pattern (like a 2 in the input), then it's replaced with a certain value. \n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2's second row input and output. The input row is 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 5 5 5 0 0 0. The output row is 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 7 5 5 0 0 0. So the 13th element (index 12) is 5 in input, becomes 7. \n\nLooking at that cell's neighbors, maybe there's a 5 in the cell above or below. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the sum of the cell's value and the value of the cell two steps to the right. But that's just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with the sum of their adjacent cells. For example, the cell (i,j) is replaced with the sum of its neighbors. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me think of another approach. \n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The first row input is 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. Output is 0 0 7 7 7 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. So the third and fourth elements (indices 2 and 3) are 5 in input, but 7 in output. \n\nLooking at the surrounding cells for these positions. Maybe these positions are part of a group where the value is increased by 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is part of a certain shape (like a line of 5s), then it's replaced with 7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on some rule. For example, in example 1, the 7th row's 6th element (5) becomes 4. The 7th element (5) becomes 7. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 4 and 7 in positions where there are certain patterns. For example, in the 7th row, the 6th and 7th elements are 5 in input, but in output, they are 4 and 7. Maybe this is related to the presence of a 2 in the cell to the left. \n\nLooking at the input row 7: the 5th element is 2. So maybe the cell to the left of the 6th element (which is 5) is 2. So the 6th element is replaced with 4 (2 + 2?), and the 7th element (5) is replaced with 7 (5 + 2). \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if there is a 2 in the cell to the left, then the current cell is replaced with some value. \n\nBut this is too speculative. \n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 7s in certain positions. Let me check if those positions are where there are 5s in the input. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 7th element (index 6) is 5 in input, becomes 7. \n\nIn example 2's second row, the 13th element (index 12) is 5 in input, becomes 7. \n\nIn example 3's second row, the 5th element (index 4) is 5 in input, becomes 7. \n\nSo maybe whenever there is a 5 in the input, it's replaced with 7 if there's a 2 in the cell to the left or something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is adjacent to a 2, then it's replaced with 7. \n\nBut in example 1's row 7, the 5th element is 2. The 6th element is 5, which is adjacent to 2. So it's replaced with 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell is replaced with the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right. For example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th element is 5. The cell to the left is 0 (cell (7,4) is 0?), and the cell to the right is 5 (cell (7,6) is 5). 0 + 5 = 5, but the output is 4. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is replaced with the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, minus something. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the 7th row's 6th element is 4. The input is 5. In example 3's second row, the 5th element is 5 in input, and becomes 7. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that whenever a cell is part of a certain pattern (like a 2 in the cell to the left), it's replaced with a certain value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the number of times a certain value appears in the entire grid. But that's unlikely. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 7th row has 4 and 7. Let's see if those numbers are related to the number of 5s in the surrounding area. For example, if there are three 5s around the cell, it's replaced with 7. \n\nBut without more data, this is hard to verify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the right, but that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced based on their position. For example, in example 1's output, the 7th row's 6th element is 4. The input is 5. Maybe this is because the cell is in a certain row and column. \n\nBut again, without more data, this is hard. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 4 and 7 in certain positions. In example 2, there are 7s in certain positions. In example 3, there are 7s as well. So maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with 4 or 7 based on some rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output value is the sum of the cell's value and the value of the cell two steps to the right. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell's value and the value of the cell to the left, but this is also a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell's value and the value of the cell to the left and the cell to the right. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 0, to the right is 5. So 5 + 0 + 5 = 10. But the output is 4. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the sum of the cell's value and the value of the cell two steps to the right. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell two steps to the right is 5 (cell 8). 5 + 5 = 10. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus the value of the cell to the right. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 0, to the right is 5. 0 + 5 = 5, but output is 4. Not matching. \n\nHmm. This is challenging. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. \n\nLooking at example 3's output, the first row has 7s in the third and fourth positions. The input first row has 5s in those positions. So maybe the transformation is that if the cell is part of a group of 5s, then it's replaced with 7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the number of times a certain value appears in the row. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to tell. \n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is part of a certain shape, like a line of 5s, then it's replaced with 7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position relative to other cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the number of 5s in the entire grid. But that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the 7th row's 6th element is 4. The input is 5. The cell to the left is 0, and the cell to the right is 5. Maybe the cell is replaced with the sum of the left and right cells minus 1. 0 + 5 = 5 - 1 = 4. That fits. \n\nThen for the 7th element (index 6), the cell to the left is 5 (index 5 is 4?), wait no. Let me recheck. \n\nWait, in example 1's row 7, the input is:\n\n0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 6th element (index 5) is 5, the 7th element (index 6) is 5. \n\nIf the rule is that the cell is replaced with the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, minus 1. \n\nFor the 6th element (index 5), the left is 2 (index 4), and the right is 5 (index 6). So 2 + 5 = 7 - 1 = 6? But the output is 4. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, minus something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell is replaced with the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, but divided by 2. \n\nFor the 6th element (index 5), the left is 2, right is 5. 2 + 5 = 7, divided by 2 is 3.5, but output is 4. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, but rounded down. 7 becomes 7. No. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, but if the sum is even, it's divided by 2, else it's the same. \n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the right, but that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's row 7, the 6th element becomes 4. The cell to the left is 2 (index 4). Maybe the cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus 2. 2 + 2 = 4. That fits. \n\nThen for the 7th element (index 6), the cell to the left is 4 (index 5), so 4 + 3 = 7? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus 2. But why? \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th element is 5. The cell to the left is 2. So 2 + 2 = 4. That fits. The 7th element is 5. The cell to the left is 4 (from the previous cell's output?), but that's not the input. \n\nHmm, this seems like a possible pattern. But how to generalize this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell is part of a certain pattern. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 4 and 7 in certain positions. In example 2, the output has 7 in the 13th position. In example 3, the output has 7 in the 5th position. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is part of a group of 5s, then it's replaced with 7. But how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus the value of the cell to the right, divided by 2. \n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of a different approach. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the 7th row has 4 and 7. Let's see what happens if the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the value of the cell to the left plus 2. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 2. 2 + 2 = 4. That fits. The 7th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 4 (from the previous cell's output). 4 + 2 = 6, but the output is 7. Doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus 3. For the 6th cell, 2 + 3 = 5. No, but the output is 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell is in a certain position. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus the value of the cell to the right, but only if the cell is part of a certain pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus the value of the cell to the right, but if the sum is even, it's divided by 2, else it's the same. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 2, to the right is 5. Sum is 7, which is odd. So output is 7. But the output is 4. Doesn't fit. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nMaybe I should look for a different pattern. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the 7th row has 4 and 7. Let me think about the position of these cells. The 6th cell is in the middle of the row. Maybe the transformation is that for cells in certain positions, like the middle, they are replaced with a certain value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the right, but this doesn't fit. \n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to think of a general transformation that could explain some of the examples. \n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell's value and the value of the cell to the left, but this is just a guess. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 2. 5 + 2 = 7. But the output is 4. No. \n\nAlternatively, the output is the cell to the left minus 2. 2 - 2 = 0. No. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nMaybe I should think of the transformation as a kind of convolution, where each cell is replaced with the sum of its neighbors. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. Let's say the sum of the surrounding cells (up, down, left, right) is 2 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 17. But the output is 4. \n\nNo. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the neighboring cells in a certain pattern. \n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to think of the transformation as a simple rule that replaces certain values. \n\nFor example, in example 1's output, the 7th row has 4 and 7. Maybe these are the results of replacing 5 with 4 or 7 based on some condition. \n\nBut what condition? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus the value of the cell to the right, divided by 2. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The left is 2, right is 5. (2 + 5)/2 = 3.5, rounded to 4. That fits. The 7th cell is 5. The left is 4 (from the previous cell's output?), right is 5. (4 + 5)/2 = 4.5, rounded to 5. But the output is 7. No. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, divided by 2, but only if the sum is even. \n\nBut this is not working. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, but if the sum is greater than 10, it's replaced with 7. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. Left is 2, right is 5. Sum is 7. Output is 4. No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, but if the sum is greater than 5, it's replaced with 7. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that certain cells are being replaced with 4 or 7. Maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is part of a certain pattern (like a 2 in the cell to the left), then it's replaced with 4 or 7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 2. So 2 + 2 = 4. That fits. The 7th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 4 (from the previous cell's output). 4 + 2 = 6, but the output is 7. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value of the cell to the left plus 3. 2 + 3 = 5, but output is 4. No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell, the output is the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. Otherwise, it's the same as the input. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the value of the cell to the right plus 2. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the right is 5. 5 + 2 = 7, but the output is 4. No. \n\nAlternatively, the cell to the left is 2, so output is 2 + 2 = 4. \n\nThis seems to fit for the 6th cell in example 1's row 7. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell to the left is 2, then the current cell is replaced with 4. \n\nBut in example 1's row 7, the 7th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 4 (from the previous cell's output). So this would not apply. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. \n\nLooking at example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is replaced with 4, and the 7th with 7. The cell to the left of the 6th cell is 2. Maybe the transformation is that if the cell to the left is 2, then the current cell is replaced with 4. But the 7th cell's left is 4, so it's not replaced. \n\nBut why is the 7th cell replaced with 7? \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell to the left is 2, then the current cell is replaced with 4. If the cell to the left is 5, then it's replaced with 7. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is 4 if the cell to the left is 2, and 7 if the cell to the left is 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and write code that for each cell, checks the cell to the left and replaces it with 4 or 7 based on some condition. \n\nBut this is not a solid solution. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. \n\nBut this is a guess. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 2. So 2 + 2 = 4. That fits. \n\nThe 7th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 4 (from the previous cell's output). 4 + 2 = 6, but the output is 7. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut maybe the cell to the left is 5, then the current cell is replaced with 7. \n\nSo the rule is: if the cell to the left is 2, replace with 4; if the cell to the left is 5, replace with 7. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 2. So replace with 4. The 7th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 4 (from the previous cell's output). So no replacement. But the output is 7. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Given the time, I'll have to proceed with a possible solution that might not be correct but is based on the examples. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. Otherwise, the cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the right. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the right, but if the cell to the right is 5, then it's replaced with 7. \n\nBut this is also a guess. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain values based on the examples. For example, in example 1, the 7th row has 4 and 7. Maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is part of a certain pattern, it's replaced with 4 or 7. \n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is not reliable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus the value of the cell to the right. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. Left is 2, right is 5. 2 + 5 = 7. But the output is 4. No. \n\nAlternatively, the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left plus the value of the cell to the right, divided by 2. 2 + 5 = 7 / 2 = 3.5, rounded to 4. That fits. \n\nFor the 7th cell, the left is 4 (from previous cell's output), right is 5. 4 + 5 = 9 / 2 = 4.5, rounded to 5. But the output is 7. No. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's assume that the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, divided by 2, rounded down. \n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), the output is (grid[i][j-1] + grid[i][j+1]) // 2. \n\nLet's test this with example 1's row 7. \n\nFor the 6th cell (index 5), the left is 2 (index 4), right is 5 (index 6). (2 + 5)/2 = 3.5, rounded down to 3. But the output is 4. Doesn't fit. \n\nBut if it's rounded up, 3.5 becomes 4. That fits. \n\nFor the 7th cell (index 6), the left is 5 (index 5), right is 5 (index 7). (5 + 5)/2 = 5. Output is 7. No. \n\nSo this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the sum of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, and if the sum is even, it's divided by 2, else it's the same. \n\nBut this is not working. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess and proceed. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output is the value of the cell to the left plus 2 if the cell to the left is 2. \n\nSo, for example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The cell to the left is 2, so output is 2 + 2 = 4. \n\nFor the 7th cell, the cell to the left is 4 (from the previous cell's output), so 4 + 2 = 6, but the output is 7. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nBut maybe the transformation is that if the cell to the left is 2, then the current cell is replaced with 4. If the cell to the left is 5, then replaced with 7. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell's left is 2, so replaced with 4. The 7th cell's left is 4, so no change. But the output is 7. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to give up and write a function that replaces certain values based on the examples, even if it's not correct. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is part of a certain pattern, like a 2 in the cell to the left, it's replaced with 4. Otherwise, it's replaced with 7 if the cell to the left is 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that for each cell, checks the cell to the left and replaces it with 4 if it's 2, and 7 if it's 5. \n\nBut this is not a general solution. \n\nHowever, given the time, I'll proceed with this approach. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(19):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(19):\n            if j > 0:\n                left = grid[i][j-1]\n                if left == 2:\n                    row.append(4)\n                elif left == 5:\n                    row.append(7)\n                else:\n                    row.append(grid[i][j])\n            else:\n                row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nHowever, this might not work for all examples. For example, in example 1's row 7, the 7th cell's left is 4 (from previous cell's output), so it would append 4. But the output is 7. So this is not correct. \n\nBut given the time, this is the best I can do. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the right plus 2. \n\nIn example 1's row 7, the 6th cell's right is 5, so 5 + 2 = 7. But the output is 4. No. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the code that replaces certain values based on the examples, even if it's not correct. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 7th row has 4 and 7. These could be the results of replacing 5 with 4 or 7 based on the presence of a 2 in the cell to the left. \n\nSo, for each cell, if the cell to the left is 2, replace with 4. If the cell to the left is 5, replace with 7. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(19):\n        new_row = []\n        for j in range(19):\n            if j > 0:\n                left = grid[i][j-1]\n                if left == 2:\n                    new_row.append(4)\n                elif left == 5:\n                    new_row.append(7)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(grid[i][j])\n            else:\n                new_row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nThis is a possible solution, but it may not work for all examples. \n\nFor example, in example 1's row 7, the 6th cell is 5. The left is 2, so it becomes 4. The 7th cell is 5, left is 4, so it stays 5. But in the output, it's 7. So this is not correct. \n\nBut maybe the code is supposed to replace the current cell with 7 if the cell to the left is 5. \n\nBut in this case, the 7th cell's left is 4, so it stays 5. But the output is 7. \n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct. \n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern, so I'll proceed with this code as a possible solution, even if it's not correct.\n"
