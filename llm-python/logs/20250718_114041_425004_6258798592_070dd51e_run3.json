Numbers (non-zero values) seem to be expanding or spreading out in some way\n2. The number 2 seems to be expanding from its original position\n3. The number 3 seems to be expanding from its original position\n4. The number 8 seems to be expanding from its original position\n5. The number 5 seems to be expanding from its original position\n6. The number 6 seems to be expanding from its original position\n7. The number 4 seems to be expanding from its original position\n8. The number 7 seems to be expanding from its original position\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that non-zero values are expanding outward in a certain pattern, possibly in a diamond shape or similar.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the expansion pattern\n    # This is a simple expansion where each non-zero value\n    # spreads out in a diamond shape (Manhattan distance <= 2)\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on the examples\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(20):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Expand in all directions within a Manhattan distance of 2\n                for di in range(-2, 3):\n                    for dj in range(-2, 3):\n                        if abs(di) + abs(dj) <= 2:\n                            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                            if 0 <= ni < 30 and 0 <= nj < 20:\n                                transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(20):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                for di in range(-2, 3):\n                    for dj in range(-2, 3):\n                        if abs(di) + abs(dj) <= 2:\n                            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                            if 0 <= ni < 30 and 0 <= nj < 20:\n                                transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

The number 7 seems to be expanding from its original position\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that non-zero values are expanding outward in a certain pattern, possibly in a diamond shape or similar.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the expansion pattern\n    # This is a simple expansion where each non-zero value\n    # spreads out in a diamond shape (Manhattan distance <= 2)\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on the examples\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(20):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Expand in all directions within a Manhattan distance of 2\n                for di in range(-2, 3):\n                    for dj in range(-2, 3):\n                        if abs(di) + abs(dj) <= 2:\n                            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                            if 0 <= ni < 30 and 0 <= nj < 20:\n                                transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(20):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                for di in range(-2, 3):\n                    for dj in range(-2, 3):\n                        if abs(di) + abs(dj) <= 2:\n                            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                            if 0 <= ni < 30 and 0 <= nj < 20:\n                                transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
