The transformation seems to propagate values from a single cell to surrounding cells in a radial pattern.\n2. When a cell contains a value (not 0), it appears to \"spread\" that value to adjacent cells in a wave-like pattern.\n3. The spread seems to follow a specific pattern of expansion, with values spreading outward in a diagonal pattern.\n4. The spread seems to stop when it reaches the edge of the grid or when it encounters a 0.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads values from non-zero cells to adjacent cells in a diagonal pattern.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = np.copy(grid_np)\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            # If the current cell is not 0, spread the value to adjacent cells\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread to the cell diagonally to the right and down\n                if i + 1 < 13 and j + 1 < 12:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j+1] = grid_np[i][j]\n                # Spread to the cell diagonally to the left and down\n                if i + 1 < 13 and j - 1 >= 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j-1] = grid_np[i][j]\n                # Spread to the cell diagonally to the right and up\n                if i - 1 >= 0 and j + 1 < 12:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j+1] = grid_np[i][j]\n                # Spread to the cell diagonally to the left and up\n                if i - 1 >= 0 and j - 1 >= 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j-1] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = np.copy(grid_np)\n    \n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                if i + 1 < 13 and j + 1 < 12:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j+1] = grid_np[i][j]\n                if i + 1 < 13 and j - 1 >= 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j-1] = grid_np[i][j]\n                if i - 1 >= 0 and j + 1 < 12:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j+1] = grid_np[i][j]\n                if i - 1 >= 0 and j - 1 >= 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j-1] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
