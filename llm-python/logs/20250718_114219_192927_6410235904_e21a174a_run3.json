Preserving the 0s in certain positions\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that numbers in the input grid are being moved to different positions in the output grid, and some numbers are being replaced with others. For example, in Example 1, the number 8 is moved to a new position and replaced with 4.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Preserves the 0s in their original positions\n- Moves numbers to new positions based on some pattern\n- Replaces certain numbers with others\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation logic based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version that captures the general idea\n    # of moving and replacing numbers based on their positions\n    \n    # Example pattern: numbers in the middle of the grid are moved to the left\n    # and certain numbers are replaced with others\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Simple pattern: move numbers to the left if they are in the middle\n                if i == 6 and j > 6:\n                    # Replace 8 with 4\n                    if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 4\n                    # Replace 2 with 1\n                    elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 1\n                    # Replace 3 with 1\n                    elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 1\n                    # Replace 4 with 2\n                    elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 2\n                    # Replace 5 with 2\n                    elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 2\n                    # Replace 6 with 2\n                    elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 2\n                    # Replace 7 with 2\n                    elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 2\n                    # Replace 8 with 4\n                    elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 4\n                    # Replace 9 with 2\n                    elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 2\n                # Move numbers to the left if they are in the middle\n                elif i == 6 and j < 6:\n                    # Move to the right\n                    if j > 0:\n                        transformed[i][j-1] = grid[i][j]\n                        transformed[i][j] = 0\n                # Move numbers to the right if they are in the middle\n                elif i == 6 and j > 6:\n                    # Move to the left\n                    if j < 12:\n                        transformed[i][j+1] = grid[i][j]\n                        transformed[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nThis implementation is a simplified version that captures the general idea of moving and replacing numbers based on their positions. It's based on the patterns observed in the training examples, but it's not a perfect solution. The actual transformation logic might be more complex and might require more detailed analysis of the examples.",
