          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. There are regions of 8s that are being transformed into sequences of numbers (like 2s, 3s, 6s) in certain positions.\n2. The transformation seems to be related to the position of 8s and the presence of other numbers (like 2, 3, 6).\n3. There appears to be a pattern where certain positions are being replaced with sequences of numbers that increase in value.\n4. The 8s in the middle of the grid (like in the 5th row of Example 1) are being replaced with sequences of numbers, while the 8s in the middle of the grid (like in Example 2) are being replaced with sequences of numbers.\n5. The transformation seems to be more complex and involves some kind of spatial pattern recognition.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain positions with sequences of numbers based on their position and the presence of 8s.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the pattern: replace 8s with sequences of numbers\n    # This is a simplified pattern that captures some of the observed behavior\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                # Check if we need to replace this 8 with a sequence\n                # This is a simplified pattern that replaces 8s with sequences of numbers\n                # based on their position and the presence of other numbers\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    # Replace with 2s\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    # Replace with 3s\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    # Replace with 6s\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    # Replace with 8s\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
