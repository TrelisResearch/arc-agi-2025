The output combines these, possibly focusing on the \"column\" or line where there's a pattern of the number 2.\n\n- Example 3:\n  Input:\n  ```\n  0 8 0\n  8 8 0\n  8 0 0\n  ```\n  Output:\n  ```\n  8 8 8 8\n  ```\n  The output is a sequence of 8s. The shape or pattern is not literally matching the input grid's shape but seems to be extending or \"flattening\" the pattern where the number 8 appears.\n\n- Example 4:\n  Input:\n  ```\n  0 0 0\n  1 0 0\n  0 1 0\n  ```\n  Output:\n  ```\n  1 1\n  ```\n  The 1s are at positions (1,0), (2,1). The output combines or aligns these into a row.\n\n**Pattern deduced:**\n\nIt seems that the output typically consists of the \"largest\" number present in the input grid, and this output is often a sequence (row or column) of that number taken from the grid. In the first case, just a single number. In others, a horizontal line of the number.\n\nIn particular:\n\n- Identify the largest non-zero number in the grid.\n- Extract the row or column where the number appears most prominently.\n- The output often is the largest number repeated along that line, possibly flattened into a single row.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n```\n4 4 0\n4 0 4\n0 0 4\n```\n\nThe largest number is 4.\n\nFrom the pattern, it seems the goal is to produce an output line filled with the largest number found in the input, matching the dominant direction:\n\n- In example 2 and 4, the \"line\" is reconstructed as a row.\n- In example 3, it was extended as a row of 8s.\n- In example 1, just the number itself.\n\nSince the final input involves 4s, and they are in multiple positions, a plausible consistent transformation would be to produce a single row filled with the maximum value in the grid, similar to examples 2, 3, and 4.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Find the maximum value (>0) in the grid.\n- Construct a single row1 with length proportional to the grid width, filled with that maximum number.\n- For simplicity, output a single row of the maximum number, with length equal to the number of columns in the original grid.\n\nLet's implement this logic.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the maximum non-zero value in the grid\n    max_val = max(max(row) for row in grid)\n    # For the output, create a single row with the maximum value\n    # matching the number of columns in the grid\n    width = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0\n    transformed_grid = [ [max_val] * width ]\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
