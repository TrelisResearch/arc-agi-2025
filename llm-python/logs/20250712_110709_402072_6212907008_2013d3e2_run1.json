But rotated or reflected?\n\n  Let's check (2,4)-(4,6):\n\n  row 2:7 7 0\n  row 3:8 8 6\n  row 4:4 4 8\n  \n  Output top left is 0 not 7 -> no direct match.\n\n- Trying to find a systematic approach:\n\nLook at the second example:\n\nInput rows 1-3 and cols 1-3:\n\n```\n1 0 0\n0 3 6\n0 5 2\n```\nOutput top-left 3x3 is:\n\n```\n1 0 0\n0 3 6\n0 5 2\n```\nThis matches exactly this sub-block.\n\nSo in example 2, output equals input[1:4][1:4].\n\nChecking example 1 output position top-left = 0, but input at (0,0) is 0 as well.\n\nTesting taking a 3x3 block from the input centered around the middle non-zero cluster.\n\nHypothesis:\n\n- Find the center of the largest group of non-zero pixels (or just find the bounding box of the colored region).\n- Extract a 3x3 subgrid from input near the upper-left corner of that bounding box.\n- The extracted 3x3 is the output.\n\nIn example 1:\n\nColored region bounding box roughly rows 2-6, cols 3-7.\n\nExtracting input[2:5][3:6]:\n\nrow 2: 0 0 7  (cols 3,4,5)\nrow 3: 6 8 8\nrow 4: 8 4 4\n\nOutput matches?\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n0 0 7\n0 6 8\n7 8 4\n```\n\nNot exact but rotated or shifted.\n\nIn example 2:\n\nColored region bounded approx rows 1-6, cols 1-6.\n\nExtracting input[1:4][1:4]:\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 3 6\n\n0 5 2\n\nMatches output exactly.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe output seems to be a 3x3 slice from the colored region, starting near its upper-left corner.\n\nImplementation plan:\n\n- Find bounding box of all non-zero pixels\n\n- Extract the top-left 3x3 block of that bounding box\n\n- If bounding box too small, pad with zeros\n\nThis works perfectly for example 2, fairly well for example 1 (though slight mismatch), but good enough as a hypothesis.\n\n---\n\nCode plan:\n\n- Find min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col where grid[row][col] !=0\n\n- Extract 3x3 block starting at (min_row, min_col)\n\n- If grid smaller than that or near edges, pad zeros accordingly\n\nReturn that 3x3 grid.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find bounding box of non-zero region\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    min_r, max_r = rows, -1\n    min_c, max_c = cols, -1\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                if r < min_r: min_r = r\n                if r > max_r: max_r = r\n                if c < min_c: min_c = c\n                if c > max_c: max_c = c\n\n    # If no non-zero pixels, return 3x3 zeros\n    if max_r == -1:\n        return [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]\n    \n    # Extract 3x3 block starting from min_r, min_c, padding if needed\n    output = []\n    for dr in range(3):\n        row_vals = []\n        rr = min_r + dr\n        for dc in range(3):\n            cc = min_c + dc\n            if 0 <= rr < rows and 0 <= cc < cols:\n                row_vals.append(grid[rr][cc])\n            else:\n                row_vals.append(0)\n        output.append(row_vals)\n    \n    return output\n```\n\nThis program captures the main observed pattern: output is a 3x3 slice of the input starting at the top-left corner of the bounding box of colors.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find bounding box of non-zero region\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    min_r, max_r = rows, -1\n    min_c, max_c = cols, -1\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                if r < min_r: min_r = r\n                if r > max_r: max_r = r\n                if c < min_c: min_c = c\n                if c > max_c: max_c = c\n\n    # If no non-zero pixels, return 3x3 zeros\n    if max_r == -1:\n        return [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]\n    \n    # Extract 3x3 block starting from min_r, min_c, padding if needed\n    output = []\n    for dr in range(3):\n        row_vals = []\n        rr = min_r + dr\n        for dc in range(3):\n            cc = min_c + dc\n            if 0 <= rr < rows and 0 <= cc < cols:\n                row_vals.append(grid[rr][cc])\n            else:\n                row_vals.append(0)\n        output.append(row_vals)\n    \n    return output\n```"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.**\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 8 8 6 0 0 0\n0 0 7 8 4 4 8 7 0 0\n0 0 7 8 4 4 8 7 0 0\n0 0 0 6 8 8 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 7\n0 6 8\n7 8 4\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 3 6 5 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 2 2 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 2 2 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 5 6 3 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 0 0\n0 3 6\n0 5 2\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 8 4 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 3 3 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 3 3 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 4 8 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

But rotated or reflected?\n\n  Let's check (2,4)-(4,6):\n\n  row 2:7 7 0\n  row 3:8 8 6\n  row 4:4 4 8\n  \n  Output top left is 0 not 7 -> no direct match.\n\n- Trying to find a systematic approach:\n\nLook at the second example:\n\nInput rows 1-3 and cols 1-3:\n\n```\n1 0 0\n0 3 6\n0 5 2\n```\nOutput top-left 3x3 is:\n\n```\n1 0 0\n0 3 6\n0 5 2\n```\nThis matches exactly this sub-block.\n\nSo in example 2, output equals input[1:4][1:4].\n\nChecking example 1 output position top-left = 0, but input at (0,0) is 0 as well.\n\nTesting taking a 3x3 block from the input centered around the middle non-zero cluster.\n\nHypothesis:\n\n- Find the center of the largest group of non-zero pixels (or just find the bounding box of the colored region).\n- Extract a 3x3 subgrid from input near the upper-left corner of that bounding box.\n- The extracted 3x3 is the output.\n\nIn example 1:\n\nColored region bounding box roughly rows 2-6, cols 3-7.\n\nExtracting input[2:5][3:6]:\n\nrow 2: 0 0 7  (cols 3,4,5)\nrow 3: 6 8 8\nrow 4: 8 4 4\n\nOutput matches?\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n0 0 7\n0 6 8\n7 8 4\n```\n\nNot exact but rotated or shifted.\n\nIn example 2:\n\nColored region bounded approx rows 1-6, cols 1-6.\n\nExtracting input[1:4][1:4]:\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 3 6\n\n0 5 2\n\nMatches output exactly.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe output seems to be a 3x3 slice from the colored region, starting near its upper-left corner.\n\nImplementation plan:\n\n- Find bounding box of all non-zero pixels\n\n- Extract the top-left 3x3 block of that bounding box\n\n- If bounding box too small, pad with zeros\n\nThis works perfectly for example 2, fairly well for example 1 (though slight mismatch), but good enough as a hypothesis.\n\n---\n\nCode plan:\n\n- Find min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col where grid[row][col] !=0\n\n- Extract 3x3 block starting at (min_row, min_col)\n\n- If grid smaller than that or near edges, pad zeros accordingly\n\nReturn that 3x3 grid.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find bounding box of non-zero region\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    min_r, max_r = rows, -1\n    min_c, max_c = cols, -1\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                if r < min_r: min_r = r\n                if r > max_r: max_r = r\n                if c < min_c: min_c = c\n                if c > max_c: max_c = c\n\n    # If no non-zero pixels, return 3x3 zeros\n    if max_r == -1:\n        return [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]\n    \n    # Extract 3x3 block starting from min_r, min_c, padding if needed\n    output = []\n    for dr in range(3):\n        row_vals = []\n        rr = min_r + dr\n        for dc in range(3):\n            cc = min_c + dc\n            if 0 <= rr < rows and 0 <= cc < cols:\n                row_vals.append(grid[rr][cc])\n            else:\n                row_vals.append(0)\n        output.append(row_vals)\n    \n    return output\n```\n\nThis program captures the main observed pattern: output is a 3x3 slice of the input starting at the top-left corner of the bounding box of colors.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find bounding box of non-zero region\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    min_r, max_r = rows, -1\n    min_c, max_c = cols, -1\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                if r < min_r: min_r = r\n                if r > max_r: max_r = r\n                if c < min_c: min_c = c\n                if c > max_c: max_c = c\n\n    # If no non-zero pixels, return 3x3 zeros\n    if max_r == -1:\n        return [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]\n    \n    # Extract 3x3 block starting from min_r, min_c, padding if needed\n    output = []\n    for dr in range(3):\n        row_vals = []\n        rr = min_r + dr\n        for dc in range(3):\n            cc = min_c + dc\n            if 0 <= rr < rows and 0 <= cc < cols:\n                row_vals.append(grid[rr][cc])\n            else:\n                row_vals.append(0)\n        output.append(row_vals)\n    \n    return output\n```"
