    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let's start by analyzing each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput is a 6x3 grid (since each line has 6 numbers, and there are 6 rows). The output is a 3x3 grid. So the input is being transformed into a 3x3 grid. How?\n\nLet me write down the input and output for example 1:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 2 0 2 0 1 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 2 0 1 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 3 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 2 2 1\nRow 1: 2 1 0\nRow 2: 3 0 0\n\nHmm. Let's think about how the input is being converted. The output is 3x3, so maybe each row of the output is derived from some combination of input rows. Let me check the positions.\n\nLooking at the first output row (2, 2, 1). Let's see where these numbers come from in the input. The first output row might be combining elements from the first three input rows. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input rows 0, 1, 2 (the first three rows):\n\nRow 0: 2 0 2 0 1 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 2 0 1 0 0 0\n\nIf we take certain elements from these rows. For example, the first element of output row 0 is 2. Looking at row 0, column 0 is 2. Then row 0, column 2 is 2. Then row 0, column 4 is 1. But the output row 0 is 2, 2, 1. So maybe the first output row is taking elements from positions (0,0), (0,2), (0,4)? But that would be 2, 2, 1. Which matches the first output row. But wait, the input rows are 6 elements each. So maybe each output row is taking elements from different positions in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from certain positions in the input. Let's think about the output as being derived from the input in a way that each output cell is determined by some combination of input cells.\n\nAnother approach: the output is 3x3. Let's think of the input as being 6 rows, each with 3 pairs. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain pairs from the input rows. For example, the first output row could be formed by taking the first three input rows, and taking the first, third, and fifth elements (positions 0, 2, 4) of each row. Wait, but that would be 3 elements per row. Let me check:\n\nFor example, in the first output row (2, 2, 1), perhaps it's taking the first element of row 0, the third element of row 0, and the fifth element of row 0? Wait, row 0 is [2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0]. So positions 0, 2, 4 are 2, 2, 1. That's exactly the first output row. Then for the second output row, maybe the second row of the output is taking elements from rows 1, 2, 3? Wait, but the output has three rows. Let me check the second output row: 2, 1, 0. Let's see. Maybe the second output row is taking elements from row 0, row 2, row 4? Or maybe some other combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output is 3x3, so maybe each row of the output is formed by taking three elements from the input's first three rows, then next three, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1:\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 1\nRow 1: 2 1 0\nRow 2: 3 0 0\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 2 0 1 0\nRow 2: 2 0 1 0 0 0\nRow 4: 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo maybe the first output row is combining elements from row 0, row 2, row 4. Let's see:\n\nFirst output row: 2 (from row 0, column 0), 2 (from row 2, column 0?), 3 (from row 4, column 0)? But the first output row is 2, 2, 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first, third, and fifth elements (positions 0, 2, 4) of each of the first three input rows. Wait, but that would be three elements per row. But the output is 3x3. So maybe each output row is formed by taking three elements from different input rows. For example, the first output row is made from the first input row's elements at positions 0, 2, 4. The second output row is made from the second input row's elements at positions 0, 2, 4? But that would be 0, 0, 0 for the second row of the input. Which doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first, third, and fifth elements (positions 0, 2, 4) of the first three input rows. Let's check:\n\nFor example, first output row (row 0 of output) would be:\n\nrow 0, position 0: 2\n\nrow 1, position 0: 0? But that's not part of the first three rows. Wait, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from different input rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first, third, and fifth elements (positions 0, 2, 4) of the input rows, but in a way that each output row is made from three different input rows. For example, the first output row is made from the first input row's positions 0, 2, 4. The second output row is made from the second input row's positions 0, 2, 4. But in example 1, the second input row is all zeros. So that would give 0, 0, 0 for the second output row, but the actual output is 2, 1, 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from different input rows. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 1\n\nRow 1: 2 1 0\n\nRow 2: 3 0 0\n\nLooking at the input, the first output row could be from the first input row's positions 0, 2, 4 (2, 2, 1). The second output row could be from the third input row's positions 0, 2, 4 (2, 1, 0). The third output row could be from the fifth input row's positions 0, 2, 4 (3, 0, 0). Wait, that would make sense. So the output rows are taking elements from the input rows 0, 2, 4, each taking positions 0, 2, 4. But how does that fit into the output's rows?\n\nWait, the output is 3x3. So maybe each row in the output is formed by taking the elements from the input rows in positions 0, 2, 4. But the input has 6 rows. So the first three output rows are formed by taking the first, third, fifth input rows. Then for each of those rows, take the first, third, fifth elements (positions 0, 2, 4) of each input row. Let's check:\n\nFor example 1:\n\nFirst output row (row 0 of output) is from input row 0 (positions 0, 2, 4): 2, 2, 1. Which matches.\n\nSecond output row (row 1 of output) is from input row 2 (positions 0, 2, 4): 2, 1, 0. Which matches.\n\nThird output row (row 2 of output) is from input row 4 (positions 0, 2, 4): 3, 0, 0. Which matches.\n\nSo that seems to fit. So the output is formed by taking every other input row (rows 0, 2, 4) and then taking every other element (positions 0, 2, 4) of those rows. Then, each of those three rows becomes a row in the output.\n\nBut wait, the input is 6 rows. So the output is 3 rows, each being the first, third, fifth input rows. Then for each of those, take the first, third, fifth elements (positions 0, 2, 4). So the output is 3x3, where each row is formed by taking the elements from the input rows 0, 2, 4, and then the elements 0, 2, 4 of those rows.\n\nBut let's check example 2.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: 3 0 0 0 2 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: 8 0 0 0 8 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n3 0 2\n\n8 0 8\n\n0 1 0\n\nSo according to the previous pattern, the output rows would be:\n\nFirst output row: from input row 0, positions 0, 2, 4: 3, 0, 2. Which matches the first output row (3 0 2).\n\nSecond output row: from input row 2, positions 0, 2, 4: 8, 0, 8. Which matches the second output row (8 0 8).\n\nThird output row: from input row 4, positions 0, 2, 4: 0, 1, 0. Which matches the third output row (0 1 0). So this seems to fit.\n\nNow example 3:\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 2 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 6 0 0 0 6 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 2 0\n\n6 0 6\n\nAgain, according to the same pattern:\n\nFirst output row: input row 0, positions 0, 2, 4: 1, 0, 0. Which matches.\n\nSecond output row: input row 2, positions 0, 2, 4: 0, 2, 0. Which matches.\n\nThird output row: input row 4, positions 0, 2, 4: 6, 0, 6. Which matches.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. So the transformation is:\n\nTake the input grid, which is 6 rows of 6 elements each. The output is 3 rows of 3 elements each. The output's first row is the first input row's elements at positions 0, 2, 4. The second output row is the third input row's elements at positions 0, 2, 4. The third output row is the fifth input row's elements at positions 0, 2, 4.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For each of the first, third, fifth input rows (rows 0, 2, 4), take the elements at positions 0, 2, 4 (i.e., the 0th, 2nd, and 4th elements of each row) and form those into the output rows.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nTake the input grid. For each of the rows 0, 2, 4, take the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, and form those into the output rows.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take the first, third, fifth rows (indices 0, 2, 4)\n    # For each of those rows, take elements at positions 0, 2, 4\n    output = []\n    for i in range(0, 3):\n        row = grid[2*i]\n        output_row = [row[0], row[2], row[4]]\n        output.append(output_row)\n    return output\n\nWait, but in the input, each row is a list of 6 elements. So for example, row 0 is [2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0]. So row[0] is 2, row[2] is 2, row[4] is 1. Which is the first output row.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all three examples. Let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nSo for example 1, the code would take rows 0, 2, 4 of the input. For each of those rows, take elements 0, 2, 4. So:\n\nRow 0: [2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0] \u2192 2, 2, 1 \u2192 first output row.\n\nRow 2: [2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 2, 1, 0 \u2192 second output row.\n\nRow 4: [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 3, 0, 0 \u2192 third output row.\n\nWhich matches the example 1's output.\n\nSimilarly for example 2, the code would take rows 0, 2, 4:\n\nRow 0: [3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0] \u2192 3, 0, 2 \u2192 first output row.\n\nRow 2: [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0] \u2192 8, 0, 8 \u2192 second output row.\n\nRow 4: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 0, 1, 0 \u2192 third output row.\n\nWhich matches example 2's output.\n\nSame for example 3.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. Therefore, the code should be written to take the first, third, fifth input rows, and for each of those rows, take the elements at positions 0, 2, 4.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n3 0 3 0 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the input is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. So according to the pattern, the output would be:\n\nFirst output row: row 0 \u2192 elements 0, 2, 4 \u2192 3, 3, 4.\n\nSecond output row: row 2 \u2192 elements 0, 2, 4 \u2192 7, 0, 1.\n\nThird output row: row 4 \u2192 elements 0, 2, 4 \u2192 7, 0, 1.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n3 3 4\n\n7 0 1\n\n7 0 1\n\nBut the code would generate that.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. The function would take the grid, and for each of the first, third, fifth rows (indices 0, 2, 4), take the elements at positions 0, 2, 4. So the code is as follows.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written as a Python function. The grid is a list of lists. So the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[2*i]\n        output_row = [row[0], row[2], row[4]]\n        output.append(output_row)\n    return output\n\nBut wait, the input is a 2D list. Let's check for example 1, the input is 6 rows. So grid[0], grid[2], grid[4] are the rows 0, 2, 4. Then for each of those, take the 0th, 2nd, 4th elements.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n\nSo the final answer is this code.\n"

Let's think about how the input is being converted. The output is 3x3, so maybe each row of the output is derived from some combination of input rows. Let me check the positions.\n\nLooking at the first output row (2, 2, 1). Let's see where these numbers come from in the input. The first output row might be combining elements from the first three input rows. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input rows 0, 1, 2 (the first three rows):\n\nRow 0: 2 0 2 0 1 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 2 0 1 0 0 0\n\nIf we take certain elements from these rows. For example, the first element of output row 0 is 2. Looking at row 0, column 0 is 2. Then row 0, column 2 is 2. Then row 0, column 4 is 1. But the output row 0 is 2, 2, 1. So maybe the first output row is taking elements from positions (0,0), (0,2), (0,4)? But that would be 2, 2, 1. Which matches the first output row. But wait, the input rows are 6 elements each. So maybe each output row is taking elements from different positions in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from certain positions in the input. Let's think about the output as being derived from the input in a way that each output cell is determined by some combination of input cells.\n\nAnother approach: the output is 3x3. Let's think of the input as being 6 rows, each with 3 pairs. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain pairs from the input rows. For example, the first output row could be formed by taking the first three input rows, and taking the first, third, and fifth elements (positions 0, 2, 4) of each row. Wait, but that would be 3 elements per row. Let me check:\n\nFor example, in the first output row (2, 2, 1), perhaps it's taking the first element of row 0, the third element of row 0, and the fifth element of row 0? Wait, row 0 is [2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0]. So positions 0, 2, 4 are 2, 2, 1. That's exactly the first output row. Then for the second output row, maybe the second row of the output is taking elements from rows 1, 2, 3? Wait, but the output has three rows. Let me check the second output row: 2, 1, 0. Let's see. Maybe the second output row is taking elements from row 0, row 2, row 4? Or maybe some other combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output is 3x3, so maybe each row of the output is formed by taking three elements from the input's first three rows, then next three, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1:\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 1\nRow 1: 2 1 0\nRow 2: 3 0 0\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 2 0 1 0\nRow 2: 2 0 1 0 0 0\nRow 4: 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo maybe the first output row is combining elements from row 0, row 2, row 4. Let's see:\n\nFirst output row: 2 (from row 0, column 0), 2 (from row 2, column 0?), 3 (from row 4, column 0)? But the first output row is 2, 2, 1. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first, third, and fifth elements (positions 0, 2, 4) of each of the first three input rows. Wait, but that would be three elements per row. But the output is 3x3. So maybe each output row is formed by taking three elements from different input rows. For example, the first output row is made from the first input row's elements at positions 0, 2, 4. The second output row is made from the second input row's elements at positions 0, 2, 4? But that would be 0, 0, 0 for the second row of the input. Which doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first, third, and fifth elements (positions 0, 2, 4) of the first three input rows. Let's check:\n\nFor example, first output row (row 0 of output) would be:\n\nrow 0, position 0: 2\n\nrow 1, position 0: 0? But that's not part of the first three rows. Wait, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from different input rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first, third, and fifth elements (positions 0, 2, 4) of the input rows, but in a way that each output row is made from three different input rows. For example, the first output row is made from the first input row's positions 0, 2, 4. The second output row is made from the second input row's positions 0, 2, 4. But in example 1, the second input row is all zeros. So that would give 0, 0, 0 for the second output row, but the actual output is 2, 1, 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from different input rows. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 1\n\nRow 1: 2 1 0\n\nRow 2: 3 0 0\n\nLooking at the input, the first output row could be from the first input row's positions 0, 2, 4 (2, 2, 1). The second output row could be from the third input row's positions 0, 2, 4 (2, 1, 0). The third output row could be from the fifth input row's positions 0, 2, 4 (3, 0, 0). Wait, that would make sense. So the output rows are taking elements from the input rows 0, 2, 4, each taking positions 0, 2, 4. But how does that fit into the output's rows?\n\nWait, the output is 3x3. So maybe each row in the output is formed by taking the elements from the input rows in positions 0, 2, 4. But the input has 6 rows. So the first three output rows are formed by taking the first, third, fifth input rows. Then for each of those rows, take the first, third, fifth elements (positions 0, 2, 4) of each input row. Let's check:\n\nFor example 1:\n\nFirst output row (row 0 of output) is from input row 0 (positions 0, 2, 4): 2, 2, 1. Which matches.\n\nSecond output row (row 1 of output) is from input row 2 (positions 0, 2, 4): 2, 1, 0. Which matches.\n\nThird output row (row 2 of output) is from input row 4 (positions 0, 2, 4): 3, 0, 0. Which matches.\n\nSo that seems to fit. So the output is formed by taking every other input row (rows 0, 2, 4) and then taking every other element (positions 0, 2, 4) of those rows. Then, each of those three rows becomes a row in the output.\n\nBut wait, the input is 6 rows. So the output is 3 rows, each being the first, third, fifth input rows. Then for each of those, take the first, third, fifth elements (positions 0, 2, 4). So the output is 3x3, where each row is formed by taking the elements from the input rows 0, 2, 4, and then the elements 0, 2, 4 of those rows.\n\nBut let's check example 2.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: 3 0 0 0 2 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: 8 0 0 0 8 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n3 0 2\n\n8 0 8\n\n0 1 0\n\nSo according to the previous pattern, the output rows would be:\n\nFirst output row: from input row 0, positions 0, 2, 4: 3, 0, 2. Which matches the first output row (3 0 2).\n\nSecond output row: from input row 2, positions 0, 2, 4: 8, 0, 8. Which matches the second output row (8 0 8).\n\nThird output row: from input row 4, positions 0, 2, 4: 0, 1, 0. Which matches the third output row (0 1 0). So this seems to fit.\n\nNow example 3:\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 2 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 6 0 0 0 6 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 2 0\n\n6 0 6\n\nAgain, according to the same pattern:\n\nFirst output row: input row 0, positions 0, 2, 4: 1, 0, 0. Which matches.\n\nSecond output row: input row 2, positions 0, 2, 4: 0, 2, 0. Which matches.\n\nThird output row: input row 4, positions 0, 2, 4: 6, 0, 6. Which matches.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. So the transformation is:\n\nTake the input grid, which is 6 rows of 6 elements each. The output is 3 rows of 3 elements each. The output's first row is the first input row's elements at positions 0, 2, 4. The second output row is the third input row's elements at positions 0, 2, 4. The third output row is the fifth input row's elements at positions 0, 2, 4.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For each of the first, third, fifth input rows (rows 0, 2, 4), take the elements at positions 0, 2, 4 (i.e., the 0th, 2nd, and 4th elements of each row) and form those into the output rows.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nTake the input grid. For each of the rows 0, 2, 4, take the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, and form those into the output rows.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take the first, third, fifth rows (indices 0, 2, 4)\n    # For each of those rows, take elements at positions 0, 2, 4\n    output = []\n    for i in range(0, 3):\n        row = grid[2*i]\n        output_row = [row[0], row[2], row[4]]\n        output.append(output_row)\n    return output\n\nWait, but in the input, each row is a list of 6 elements. So for example, row 0 is [2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0]. So row[0] is 2, row[2] is 2, row[4] is 1. Which is the first output row.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all three examples. Let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nSo for example 1, the code would take rows 0, 2, 4 of the input. For each of those rows, take elements 0, 2, 4. So:\n\nRow 0: [2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0] \u2192 2, 2, 1 \u2192 first output row.\n\nRow 2: [2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 2, 1, 0 \u2192 second output row.\n\nRow 4: [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 3, 0, 0 \u2192 third output row.\n\nWhich matches the example 1's output.\n\nSimilarly for example 2, the code would take rows 0, 2, 4:\n\nRow 0: [3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0] \u2192 3, 0, 2 \u2192 first output row.\n\nRow 2: [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0] \u2192 8, 0, 8 \u2192 second output row.\n\nRow 4: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] \u2192 0, 1, 0 \u2192 third output row.\n\nWhich matches example 2's output.\n\nSame for example 3.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. Therefore, the code should be written to take the first, third, fifth input rows, and for each of those rows, take the elements at positions 0, 2, 4.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n3 0 3 0 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the input is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. So according to the pattern, the output would be:\n\nFirst output row: row 0 \u2192 elements 0, 2, 4 \u2192 3, 3, 4.\n\nSecond output row: row 2 \u2192 elements 0, 2, 4 \u2192 7, 0, 1.\n\nThird output row: row 4 \u2192 elements 0, 2, 4 \u2192 7, 0, 1.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n3 3 4\n\n7 0 1\n\n7 0 1\n\nBut the code would generate that.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. The function would take the grid, and for each of the first, third, fifth rows (indices 0, 2, 4), take the elements at positions 0, 2, 4. So the code is as follows.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written as a Python function. The grid is a list of lists. So the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[2*i]\n        output_row = [row[0], row[2], row[4]]\n        output.append(output_row)\n    return output\n\nBut wait, the input is a 2D list. Let's check for example 1, the input is 6 rows. So grid[0], grid[2], grid[4] are the rows 0, 2, 4. Then for each of those, take the 0th, 2nd, 4th elements.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n\nSo the final answer is this code.\n"
