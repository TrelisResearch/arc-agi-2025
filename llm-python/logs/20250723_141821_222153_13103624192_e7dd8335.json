The block is located at positions (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) in the respective grids.\n\n### Python Function:\nBased on the observed pattern, here is the Python function to perform the transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Check if the grid is 7x7\n    if len(grid) != 7 or any(len(row) != 7 for row in grid):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input grid must be 7x7\")\n    \n    # Define the central 3x3 block positions\n    central_positions = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]\n    \n    # Replace the central 3x3 block with the number 2\n    for row, col in central_positions:\n        for i in range(3):\n            for j in range(3):\n                grid[row + i][col + j] = 2\n    \n    return grid\n```\n\nThis function checks if the input grid is 7x7, then replaces the central 3x3 block with the number 2 as observed in the training examples.",
