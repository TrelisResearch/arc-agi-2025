          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the training examples. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput has rows of 0s and 8s. The output has 0s and 2s. The output seems to have 2s in certain positions. Let me compare the input and output for each row.\n\nLooking at the first input row: all 0s. Output is also all 0s. So that's straightforward.\n\nSecond input row: 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0. The output is 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 0. So the 8s in the input are replaced with 2s in specific positions. Let's see where the 8s are in the input and where the 2s are in the output.\n\nIn the input row 2, the 8s are at positions 1, 3, 5, 9, 10. The output has 2s at positions 2, 6, 7, 11. Wait, maybe there's a pattern here. Maybe the 8s are being replaced with 2s in certain positions based on their positions. But how?\n\nLooking at the input row 2: the 8s are in columns 1, 3, 5, 9, 10. The output's 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of pattern where the 8s are being transformed into 2s in positions that are adjacent or in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are part of a larger structure. Let's look at the entire input and output for example 1.\n\nThe input for example 1 has 8s in certain positions. The output has 2s in positions that form a certain shape. For example, in the second row, the 2s are in positions 2, 6, 7, 11. Maybe these positions are part of a diagonal or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a pattern that's being converted into 2s in a specific way. For example, maybe the 8s are part of a cross or a line that's being transformed into a different shape.\n\nLooking at the third row of example 1's input: 0 8 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0. The output is 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0. The 8s in the input are at positions 1, 3, 6, 10. The output has 2s at positions 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 8s in the input are being replaced with 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first example, the output seems to have 2s in positions that form a diamond or a cross. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are being replaced with 2s in positions that are part of a certain grid pattern. For example, maybe the 8s are part of a structure that is being converted into 2s in a way that depends on their positions relative to other elements.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput has 8s in various positions, and the output has 2s. For example, in the second row of example 2's input, the 8s are at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. The output has 2s at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. Wait, maybe the 8s in the input are being replaced with 2s in positions that are adjacent to them? Or maybe there's a pattern where the 8s are in certain positions and the 2s are in positions that are diagonally adjacent or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a certain pattern, and the 2s in the output are in positions that are part of a different pattern. For example, in example 1, the output's 2s seem to form a certain shape. Let's think about the output of example 1. The output has 2s in positions that form a kind of diamond shape. Let me try to visualize the output of example 1:\n\nRow 2: 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 0\nRow 3: 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nSo the 2s are in positions that form a kind of cross or a diamond. Maybe the 2s are placed where the 8s are in certain positions, but maybe there's a pattern based on their positions.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 8s in the input are part of a grid that is being transformed into 2s in a way that depends on the positions of the 8s. For example, if an 8 is in a certain position, then certain other positions are converted to 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a pattern that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain shape, such as a cross or a diamond. For example, in example 1, the output's 2s form a diamond shape. Let me think: in row 2, the 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. In row 3, columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. Row 4 has a 2 at column 10. Maybe this is forming a diamond shape that's centered in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a pattern that's being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain grid pattern. For example, if the 8s are in positions that are part of a certain line or shape, then the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different shape.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions of 8s in the input and the positions of 2s in the output. For example, in example 1, the input's 8s are in certain positions, and the output's 2s are in positions that are adjacent to those 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a grid that's being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the output's 2s are placed in positions that are part of a diagonal or a certain symmetry.\n\nLooking at example 3:\n\nInput is a 5x9 grid (rows 0-4, columns 0-8). The output is a 5x9 grid. The input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 2s. For example, in the second row of input, the 8s are in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 7. The output has 2s in positions 2, 3, 4, 6, 8. Hmm, maybe the 8s are being converted into 2s in positions that are adjacent to them. For example, if an 8 is in position (row, col), then certain neighboring positions are converted to 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a structure that is being transformed into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 3's output, the 2s form a cross shape. Let me check:\n\nIn example 3's output, the second row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. Third row is 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 0 0. Fourth row is 0 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 0. So the 2s form a cross shape in the middle. Maybe the 8s in the input are part of a cross shape, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different cross shape.\n\nBut how to map the input's 8s to the output's 2s?\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 2s in positions that are part of a diamond shape. For example, in the second row, the 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. In the third row, columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. In the fourth row, column 10. This seems to form a diamond shape centered in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a grid pattern where the 8s in the input are part of a certain structure. For example, the 8s in the input are part of a pattern that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern, such as a cross or a diamond.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 8s in the input are part of a grid that is being transformed into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern, such as a diamond shape. For example, the 8s in the input are in positions that are part of a diamond, and the output's 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are part of a pattern that is being transformed into 2s in positions that are part of a certain grid. For example, for each 8 in the input, certain positions are converted to 2s based on their position.\n\nBut how to find this pattern?\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output again. Let's look at the positions of 8s and 2s.\n\nIn example 1's input row 2:\n\nInput: 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n\nOutput: 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 0\n\nSo the 8s are at positions (row 1, columns 1, 3, 5, 9, 10). The 2s in the output are at (row 1, columns 2, 6, 7, 11). Wait, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 8s. For example, the 8 at column 1 (row 1) has a 2 in column 2. The 8 at column 3 has a 2 in column 2? No, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, and the 2s are in positions that are part of a different pattern. For example, the 8s in the input are in positions that are part of a grid that is being converted into a diamond shape of 2s.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of 2s in the output and see if they have a certain pattern. For example, in example 1's output, the 2s are arranged in a diamond shape. For example, in the second row, the 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. In the third row, columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. In the fourth row, column 10. This seems to form a diamond shape that is centered in the grid.\n\nIf this is the case, then maybe the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape. But how is that determined from the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a grid pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, the 8s in the input are part of a structure that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut how to find the exact transformation?\n\nAnother idea: the 8s in the input are part of a certain pattern that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the input's 8s are in positions that form a certain shape, and the output's 2s form a diamond shape. So the transformation is to convert certain positions into 2s based on the input's 8s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a grid that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain grid. For example, if the input has an 8 in a certain position, then the output has a 2 in a position that is offset by a certain amount.\n\nBut how to determine this offset?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a grid that is determined by the input's 8s. For example, for each 8 in the input, certain positions are converted to 2s. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output again. Let's consider the positions of 8s and 2s:\n\nIn the input row 2, the 8s are at positions 1, 3, 5, 9, 10. The output's 2s are at positions 2, 6, 7, 11. Hmm, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 8s. For example, the 8 at position (1,1) has a 2 at (1,2). The 8 at (1,3) has a 2 at (1,6)? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, the 8s are in certain positions, and the 2s are placed in positions that are diagonally adjacent or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid pattern, such as a diamond shape. For example, the 2s in example 1's output form a diamond shape centered in the grid. So the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their position in the grid, regardless of the input's values.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. Because in example 1's input, the 8s are in certain positions, but the output's 2s are in positions that form a diamond. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their position, regardless of the input. But that seems unlikely because the input's 8s would have to be part of a pattern that determines where the 2s are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a structure that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, the 8s are in positions that form a cross, and the 2s are in positions that form a diamond.\n\nBut how to determine this pattern?\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions of 2s in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the 2s are in positions that form a diamond shape. Let's think about the coordinates. The grid is 5 rows by 13 columns.\n\nThe diamond shape in example 1's output seems to be centered around the middle of the grid. Let's imagine that the diamond is formed by positions where the absolute difference between the row and column is a certain value. For example, for a diamond shape, the positions (row, col) where |row - center_row| + |col - center_col| = some value.\n\nBut how to determine the center and the value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape centered in the grid. For example, in a 5x13 grid, the center is around row 2, column 6 (since 13 columns, middle is at 6.5, so column 6 or 7). But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, in the input, the 8s are in certain positions, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the 8s.\n\nBut this is too vague. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output:\n\nIn example 2, the input's 8s are in certain positions, and the output's 2s are in positions that form a different pattern. For example, the second row of the output has 2s at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. This seems to be a pattern of even columns.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are even columns, but that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid pattern. For example, the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even, but that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape. For example, in example 3's output, the 2s form a cross shape. So the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their position in the grid, regardless of the input.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 8s in the input with 2s. But that's not the case in example 1. For example, in example 1's input, the second row has 8s at positions 1, 3, 5, 9, 10. The output has 2s at positions 2, 6, 7, 11. So not all 8s are replaced with 2s.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is more complex than that.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 8s in the input are part of a pattern that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, the 8s are in positions that are part of a certain shape, and the 2s are in positions that form a different shape.\n\nBut how to find this shape?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid based on the input's 8s. For example, the 8s are in positions that are part of a grid, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern derived from the input's 8s.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a grid where the row and column indices satisfy certain conditions. For example, in example 1's output, the 2s are placed in positions where (row + col) is even or something like that.\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nRow 1 (second row of input, first row of output): 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 0\n\nColumns with 2s: 2, 6, 7, 11.\n\nRow 2 (third row of input, second row of output): 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0\n\nColumns with 2s: 2, 5, 7, 9, 11.\n\nRow 3 (fourth row of input, third row of output): 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n\nColumn with 2: 9.\n\nSo for these positions, what's the pattern?\n\nLet's think of the positions as (row, col). For example, in the first row of output (row 1), the 2s are at (1,2), (1,6), (1,7), (1,11).\n\nFor row 1, the columns are 2, 6, 7, 11.\n\nLooking at the columns, these are positions that are even? 2 is even, 6 even, 7 odd, 11 odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these positions are part of a certain pattern based on their distance from the center of the grid. For example, the center of the grid is at row 2, column 6 (since 5 rows, middle is row 2; 13 columns, middle is column 6.5, so column 6 or 7).\n\nFor example, in row 1, the columns 2, 6, 7, 11 are at distances from the center column (6.5). Let's calculate:\n\nFor column 2: distance from 6.5 is 4.5.\n\nColumn 6: 0.5.\n\nColumn 7: 0.5.\n\nColumn 11: 4.5.\n\nSo the 2s are at positions that are at a certain distance from the center. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the absolute difference between the column and the center column is 4.5 or 0.5. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape. For example, in a diamond shape, the sum of the row and column indices is a certain value.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the output has 2s in positions that form certain shapes. For example, in example 1, the output's 2s form a diamond shape. In example 2, the output's 2s form a cross shape. In example 3, the output's 2s form a cross shape.\n\nBut how to determine this from the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on the input's 8s. For example, if an 8 is in a certain position, then certain other positions are converted to 2s.\n\nBut how to find this pattern?\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has 2s in positions that are part of certain patterns. For example, in example 1, the 2s are in positions that form a diamond shape. In example 2, the 2s are in positions that form a cross shape. In example 3, the 2s form a cross shape.\n\nBut how to map this to the input?\n\nMaybe the input's 8s are part of a structure that is being converted into 2s in a certain pattern. For example, the 8s in the input are part of a cross shape, and the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are part of a grid that is being transformed into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, the 8s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, and the 2s are in positions that are part of a different pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, for each 8 in the input, certain positions are converted to 2s. For example, if an 8 is in position (i,j), then positions (i+1,j), (i-1,j), (i,j+1), (i,j-1) are converted to 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's input row 2, which has 8s at positions 1, 3, 5, 9, 10. If we apply this idea, then for each 8, the adjacent positions would be converted to 2s. But this would create more 2s than in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are part of a pattern that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain grid. For example, the 8s are in positions that form a certain shape, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different shape.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother approach: let's think about the output of example 1. The output has 2s in positions that form a diamond shape. The diamond is centered in the grid. For a 5x13 grid, the center is at row 2, column 6.5. So the diamond might have positions where the absolute difference between row and 2, plus the absolute difference between column and 6.5 is less than or equal to a certain value.\n\nFor example, in row 1 (row index 1), the columns with 2s are 2, 6, 7, 11. Let's calculate for each of these positions:\n\nFor (1,2): |1-2| + |2-6.5| = 1 + 4.5 = 5.5.\n\nFor (1,6): |1-2| + |6-6.5| = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5.\n\nFor (1,7): |1-2| + |7-6.5| = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5.\n\nFor (1,11): |1-2| + |11-6.5| = 1 + 4.5 = 5.5.\n\nSo the sum is 1.5 or 5.5. This suggests that the diamond is formed by positions where the sum is within a certain range. But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation is to place 2s in positions that satisfy this condition. But how to determine this condition from the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the sum of the row and column indices is a certain value. For example, in example 1's output, the 2s are in positions where row + column is even or something like that.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, the input's 8s are in positions that form a certain pattern, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different pattern.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a grid where the row and column indices satisfy certain conditions. For example, in example 1, the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even or something.\n\nBut this is not consistent with all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 8s in the input with 2s, but only in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 8s with 2s, but only in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1's input, the 8s are in certain positions, and the output has 2s in positions that are part of a diamond shape. So the transformation is to replace the 8s with 2s in positions that are part of a diamond shape.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are part of the diamond shape?\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I need to find a pattern that can be implemented in code.\n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern that is consistent across all examples.\n\nIn example 1, the output has 2s in positions that form a diamond shape. In example 2, the output has 2s in positions that form a cross shape. In example 3, the output has 2s in a cross shape. So maybe the pattern is that the output has 2s in positions that are part of a cross or diamond shape, but how to determine this from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid based on the input's 8s. For example, the 8s in the input are part of a grid that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid based on the input's 8s. For example, for each 8 in the input, the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern around it.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid based on the input's 8s. For example, the 8s are in certain positions, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid that is derived from the input's 8s.\n\nBut without more information, this is too vague.\n\nMaybe I should think of the transformation as a pattern that replaces certain positions with 2s based on their position in the grid, regardless of the input. For example, in example 1, the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape. So the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their position in the grid.\n\nBut how to determine these positions?\n\nFor example, in a 5x13 grid, the diamond shape might be defined as positions where the absolute difference between row and 2 (the middle row) plus the absolute difference between column and 6 (the middle column) is less than or equal to a certain value.\n\nLet's try this. For example, in example 1's output, the diamond might be defined by:\n\n|row - 2| + |col - 6| <= 2.\n\nLet's check:\n\nFor row 1 (row index 1), col 2: |1-2| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5, which is greater than 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diamond is defined by |row - 2| + |col - 6| <= 3.\n\nFor row 1, col 2: 1 + 4 = 5, which is still greater than 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, the input's 8s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different pattern. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. Let's look at the positions of 2s in example 1's output:\n\nRow 1 (second row of input): columns 2, 6, 7, 11.\n\nRow 2 (third row of input): columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11.\n\nRow 3 (fourth row of input): column 9.\n\nRow 4 (fifth row of input): none.\n\nSo, for row 1, the 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. For row 2, columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. For row 3, column 9.\n\nThis seems to form a pattern where the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in row 1, columns 2, 6, 7, 11: these are positions that are at a certain distance from the center.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape. For example, in row 1, the 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. In row 2, columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. In row 3, column 9. This seems to form a diamond shape that is centered in the grid.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their position in the grid, regardless of the input. But how to determine these positions?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape centered in the grid. For example, the diamond is defined as follows: for each position (row, col), if the absolute difference between row and 2 (the middle row) plus the absolute difference between col and 6 (the middle column) is less than or equal to 3, then it is a 2.\n\nLet's test this for example 1's output:\n\nFor row 1, column 2: |1-2| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 > 3 \u2192 no. But in the output, this position is a 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diamond is defined by |row - 2| + |col - 6| <= 2.\n\nFor row 1, column 2: 1 + 4 = 5 > 2 \u2192 no. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even. For example, in example 1's output, the columns with 2s are 2, 6, 7, 11. 2 is even, 6 is even, 7 is odd, 11 is odd. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even or odd, depending on the row. This is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape. Let's assume that the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their position in the grid, forming a diamond shape. For example, the diamond is centered in the grid, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of this diamond.\n\nBut how to determine the exact positions?\n\nMaybe the diamond is defined as follows: for a 5x13 grid, the diamond is formed by positions where the column is between 2 and 11, and the row is between 1 and 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the diamond is formed by positions where the column is even or odd, depending on the row.\n\nBut without more information, I can't determine this.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make a hypothesis and implement it.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace all 8s in the input with 2s, but only in certain positions. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in certain positions, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, if an 8 is in position (i,j), then the 2 is placed in position (i+1, j+1).\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAnother idea: looking at example 1's input and output, the 8s are in positions that form a certain pattern, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different pattern. For example, in example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, I can't determine this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace all 8s with 2s, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in example 1's input, the 8s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different pattern.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll make a hypothesis that the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape centered in the grid. For example, for each position (row, col), if the absolute difference between row and 2 (middle row) plus the absolute difference between col and 6 (middle column) is less than or equal to 3, then it is a 2.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nFor example, in example 1's output, the position (1,2) would have |1-2| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 > 3 \u2192 no. But in the output, this position is a 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the diamond is defined by |row - 2| + |col - 6| <= 2. For example, in row 1, column 2: 1 + 4 = 5 > 2 \u2192 no. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the transformation is to replace all 8s with 2s, but only in certain positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nGiven the examples, maybe the transformation is to replace 8s with 2s in positions where the column is even. For example, in example 1's input, the 8s are at columns 1, 3, 5, 9, 10. The output's 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even or odd based on the row.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 8s with 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern, such as a cross or diamond. For example, the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace all 8s with 2s, but only in certain positions. For example, the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 8s with 2s in positions where the column is even.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the examples, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the 2s are placed in positions that form a cross shape. For example, in example 3, the output has a cross shape. So the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on a cross shape.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is 1, 2, or 3, and the column is 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to implement a function that replaces 8s with 2s in certain positions, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, for each 8 in the input, the 2 is placed in the next position to the right.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the examples, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor each position in the input grid, if the value is 8, replace it with 2. But this doesn't fit the examples, because in example 1's input, the output has 2s in positions that are not all the 8s.\n\nBut in example 1, the input has 8s at positions (1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (1,9), (1,10). The output has 2s at (1,2), (1,6), (1,7), (1,11). So this suggests that the 8s are not directly replaced with 2s.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, for each 8 in the input, the 2 is placed in a position that is diagonally adjacent.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, the 8s are in positions that form a certain shape, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different shape.\n\nBut without more information, I'm stuck.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell in the input grid, if the value is 8, replace it with 2. But this is likely incorrect, but it's a starting point.\n\nHowever, this would not work for example 1, where the output has 2s in positions that are not all 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 8s with 2s in positions where the column is even. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut given the examples, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace all 8s with 2s, but only in certain rows. For example, in example 1, the 2s are in rows 1, 2, and 3.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm forced to make an educated guess. Based on the examples, I'll assume that the 2s are placed in positions that form a certain pattern, such as a cross or diamond, and implement a function that generates 2s in those positions.\n\nFor example, in a 5x13 grid, the 2s are placed in positions that form a cross shape. The cross shape would have 2s in the middle row and middle column, and extending out.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, in the middle row (row 2), the 2s are placed in columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. In the middle column (column 6), the 2s are placed in rows 1, 2, 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain positions with 2s based on a cross shape.\n\nBut how to determine these positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is 1, 2, or 3, and the column is 2, 5, 7, 9, 11.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain positions with 2s based on a pattern.\n\nBut this is not based on any solid reasoning, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(5)]\n    # Place 2s in certain positions based on the pattern\n    # For example, in row 1, columns 2, 6, 7, 11\n    # In row 2, columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11\n    # In row 3, column 9\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if (i == 1 and j in [2, 6, 7, 11]) or \\\n               (i == 2 and j in [2, 5, 7, 9, 11]) or \\\n               (i == 3 and j == 9):\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not based on the input grid, but on hard-coded positions. This would not work for the test input, but it's a guess.\n\nHowever, this is not correct, because the test input is different, and the transformation should be based on the input.\n\nBut given the examples, this is the best I can do.\n\nBut this approach is not based on any pattern from the input, but on hard-coded positions. This is likely incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I need to find a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even. For example, in example 1, the 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. 2 and 6 are even, 7 and 11 are odd. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even or odd based on the row.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: replace all 8s in the input with 2s. This is not correct for the examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut in example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 2s in other positions. So this is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the transformation is to replace 8s with 2s in certain positions, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 8s with 2s, but only in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the 8s are in certain positions, and the 2s are in other positions. But how to determine this.\n\nMaybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, the 8s are in positions that form a certain pattern, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different pattern.\n\nBut without more information, I'm stuck.\n\nAt this point, I'll have to make a guess that the transformation is to replace 8s with 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern, and implement that.\n\nBut since I can't determine the exact pattern, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell in the input grid, if the value is 8, replace it with 2. This is not correct for the examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nBut this is likely incorrect, but it's the only option I have.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(5)]\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n```\n\nBut this is likely incorrect, but it's the best I can do given the time and information.\n"

Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput has rows of 0s and 8s. The output has 0s and 2s. The output seems to have 2s in certain positions. Let me compare the input and output for each row.\n\nLooking at the first input row: all 0s. Output is also all 0s. So that's straightforward.\n\nSecond input row: 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0. The output is 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 0. So the 8s in the input are replaced with 2s in specific positions. Let's see where the 8s are in the input and where the 2s are in the output.\n\nIn the input row 2, the 8s are at positions 1, 3, 5, 9, 10. The output has 2s at positions 2, 6, 7, 11. Wait, maybe there's a pattern here. Maybe the 8s are being replaced with 2s in certain positions based on their positions. But how?\n\nLooking at the input row 2: the 8s are in columns 1, 3, 5, 9, 10. The output's 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of pattern where the 8s are being transformed into 2s in positions that are adjacent or in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are part of a larger structure. Let's look at the entire input and output for example 1.\n\nThe input for example 1 has 8s in certain positions. The output has 2s in positions that form a certain shape. For example, in the second row, the 2s are in positions 2, 6, 7, 11. Maybe these positions are part of a diagonal or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a pattern that's being converted into 2s in a specific way. For example, maybe the 8s are part of a cross or a line that's being transformed into a different shape.\n\nLooking at the third row of example 1's input: 0 8 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0. The output is 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0. The 8s in the input are at positions 1, 3, 6, 10. The output has 2s at positions 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 8s in the input are being replaced with 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first example, the output seems to have 2s in positions that form a diamond or a cross. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are being replaced with 2s in positions that are part of a certain grid pattern. For example, maybe the 8s are part of a structure that is being converted into 2s in a way that depends on their positions relative to other elements.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput has 8s in various positions, and the output has 2s. For example, in the second row of example 2's input, the 8s are at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. The output has 2s at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. Wait, maybe the 8s in the input are being replaced with 2s in positions that are adjacent to them? Or maybe there's a pattern where the 8s are in certain positions and the 2s are in positions that are diagonally adjacent or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a certain pattern, and the 2s in the output are in positions that are part of a different pattern. For example, in example 1, the output's 2s seem to form a certain shape. Let's think about the output of example 1. The output has 2s in positions that form a kind of diamond shape. Let me try to visualize the output of example 1:\n\nRow 2: 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 0\nRow 3: 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nSo the 2s are in positions that form a kind of cross or a diamond. Maybe the 2s are placed where the 8s are in certain positions, but maybe there's a pattern based on their positions.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 8s in the input are part of a grid that is being transformed into 2s in a way that depends on the positions of the 8s. For example, if an 8 is in a certain position, then certain other positions are converted to 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a pattern that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain shape, such as a cross or a diamond. For example, in example 1, the output's 2s form a diamond shape. Let me think: in row 2, the 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. In row 3, columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. Row 4 has a 2 at column 10. Maybe this is forming a diamond shape that's centered in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a pattern that's being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain grid pattern. For example, if the 8s are in positions that are part of a certain line or shape, then the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different shape.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions of 8s in the input and the positions of 2s in the output. For example, in example 1, the input's 8s are in certain positions, and the output's 2s are in positions that are adjacent to those 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a grid that's being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the output's 2s are placed in positions that are part of a diagonal or a certain symmetry.\n\nLooking at example 3:\n\nInput is a 5x9 grid (rows 0-4, columns 0-8). The output is a 5x9 grid. The input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 2s. For example, in the second row of input, the 8s are in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 7. The output has 2s in positions 2, 3, 4, 6, 8. Hmm, maybe the 8s are being converted into 2s in positions that are adjacent to them. For example, if an 8 is in position (row, col), then certain neighboring positions are converted to 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a structure that is being transformed into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 3's output, the 2s form a cross shape. Let me check:\n\nIn example 3's output, the second row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. Third row is 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 0 0. Fourth row is 0 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 0. So the 2s form a cross shape in the middle. Maybe the 8s in the input are part of a cross shape, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different cross shape.\n\nBut how to map the input's 8s to the output's 2s?\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 2s in positions that are part of a diamond shape. For example, in the second row, the 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. In the third row, columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. In the fourth row, column 10. This seems to form a diamond shape centered in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a grid pattern where the 8s in the input are part of a certain structure. For example, the 8s in the input are part of a pattern that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern, such as a cross or a diamond.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 8s in the input are part of a grid that is being transformed into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern, such as a diamond shape. For example, the 8s in the input are in positions that are part of a diamond, and the output's 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are part of a pattern that is being transformed into 2s in positions that are part of a certain grid. For example, for each 8 in the input, certain positions are converted to 2s based on their position.\n\nBut how to find this pattern?\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output again. Let's look at the positions of 8s and 2s.\n\nIn example 1's input row 2:\n\nInput: 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n\nOutput: 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 0\n\nSo the 8s are at positions (row 1, columns 1, 3, 5, 9, 10). The 2s in the output are at (row 1, columns 2, 6, 7, 11). Wait, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 8s. For example, the 8 at column 1 (row 1) has a 2 in column 2. The 8 at column 3 has a 2 in column 2? No, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, and the 2s are in positions that are part of a different pattern. For example, the 8s in the input are in positions that are part of a grid that is being converted into a diamond shape of 2s.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of 2s in the output and see if they have a certain pattern. For example, in example 1's output, the 2s are arranged in a diamond shape. For example, in the second row, the 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. In the third row, columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. In the fourth row, column 10. This seems to form a diamond shape that is centered in the grid.\n\nIf this is the case, then maybe the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape. But how is that determined from the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a grid pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, the 8s in the input are part of a structure that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut how to find the exact transformation?\n\nAnother idea: the 8s in the input are part of a certain pattern that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the input's 8s are in positions that form a certain shape, and the output's 2s form a diamond shape. So the transformation is to convert certain positions into 2s based on the input's 8s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a grid that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain grid. For example, if the input has an 8 in a certain position, then the output has a 2 in a position that is offset by a certain amount.\n\nBut how to determine this offset?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a grid that is determined by the input's 8s. For example, for each 8 in the input, certain positions are converted to 2s. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output again. Let's consider the positions of 8s and 2s:\n\nIn the input row 2, the 8s are at positions 1, 3, 5, 9, 10. The output's 2s are at positions 2, 6, 7, 11. Hmm, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 8s. For example, the 8 at position (1,1) has a 2 at (1,2). The 8 at (1,3) has a 2 at (1,6)? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, the 8s are in certain positions, and the 2s are placed in positions that are diagonally adjacent or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid pattern, such as a diamond shape. For example, the 2s in example 1's output form a diamond shape centered in the grid. So the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their position in the grid, regardless of the input's values.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. Because in example 1's input, the 8s are in certain positions, but the output's 2s are in positions that form a diamond. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their position, regardless of the input. But that seems unlikely because the input's 8s would have to be part of a pattern that determines where the 2s are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are part of a structure that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, the 8s are in positions that form a cross, and the 2s are in positions that form a diamond.\n\nBut how to determine this pattern?\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions of 2s in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the 2s are in positions that form a diamond shape. Let's think about the coordinates. The grid is 5 rows by 13 columns.\n\nThe diamond shape in example 1's output seems to be centered around the middle of the grid. Let's imagine that the diamond is formed by positions where the absolute difference between the row and column is a certain value. For example, for a diamond shape, the positions (row, col) where |row - center_row| + |col - center_col| = some value.\n\nBut how to determine the center and the value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape centered in the grid. For example, in a 5x13 grid, the center is around row 2, column 6 (since 13 columns, middle is at 6.5, so column 6 or 7). But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, in the input, the 8s are in certain positions, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the 8s.\n\nBut this is too vague. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output:\n\nIn example 2, the input's 8s are in certain positions, and the output's 2s are in positions that form a different pattern. For example, the second row of the output has 2s at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. This seems to be a pattern of even columns.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are even columns, but that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid pattern. For example, the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even, but that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape. For example, in example 3's output, the 2s form a cross shape. So the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their position in the grid, regardless of the input.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 8s in the input with 2s. But that's not the case in example 1. For example, in example 1's input, the second row has 8s at positions 1, 3, 5, 9, 10. The output has 2s at positions 2, 6, 7, 11. So not all 8s are replaced with 2s.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is more complex than that.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 8s in the input are part of a pattern that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, the 8s are in positions that are part of a certain shape, and the 2s are in positions that form a different shape.\n\nBut how to find this shape?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid based on the input's 8s. For example, the 8s are in positions that are part of a grid, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern derived from the input's 8s.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a grid where the row and column indices satisfy certain conditions. For example, in example 1's output, the 2s are placed in positions where (row + col) is even or something like that.\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nRow 1 (second row of input, first row of output): 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 0\n\nColumns with 2s: 2, 6, 7, 11.\n\nRow 2 (third row of input, second row of output): 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0\n\nColumns with 2s: 2, 5, 7, 9, 11.\n\nRow 3 (fourth row of input, third row of output): 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n\nColumn with 2: 9.\n\nSo for these positions, what's the pattern?\n\nLet's think of the positions as (row, col). For example, in the first row of output (row 1), the 2s are at (1,2), (1,6), (1,7), (1,11).\n\nFor row 1, the columns are 2, 6, 7, 11.\n\nLooking at the columns, these are positions that are even? 2 is even, 6 even, 7 odd, 11 odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these positions are part of a certain pattern based on their distance from the center of the grid. For example, the center of the grid is at row 2, column 6 (since 5 rows, middle is row 2; 13 columns, middle is column 6.5, so column 6 or 7).\n\nFor example, in row 1, the columns 2, 6, 7, 11 are at distances from the center column (6.5). Let's calculate:\n\nFor column 2: distance from 6.5 is 4.5.\n\nColumn 6: 0.5.\n\nColumn 7: 0.5.\n\nColumn 11: 4.5.\n\nSo the 2s are at positions that are at a certain distance from the center. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the absolute difference between the column and the center column is 4.5 or 0.5. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape. For example, in a diamond shape, the sum of the row and column indices is a certain value.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the output has 2s in positions that form certain shapes. For example, in example 1, the output's 2s form a diamond shape. In example 2, the output's 2s form a cross shape. In example 3, the output's 2s form a cross shape.\n\nBut how to determine this from the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on the input's 8s. For example, if an 8 is in a certain position, then certain other positions are converted to 2s.\n\nBut how to find this pattern?\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has 2s in positions that are part of certain patterns. For example, in example 1, the 2s are in positions that form a diamond shape. In example 2, the 2s are in positions that form a cross shape. In example 3, the 2s form a cross shape.\n\nBut how to map this to the input?\n\nMaybe the input's 8s are part of a structure that is being converted into 2s in a certain pattern. For example, the 8s in the input are part of a cross shape, and the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are part of a grid that is being transformed into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, the 8s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, and the 2s are in positions that are part of a different pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, for each 8 in the input, certain positions are converted to 2s. For example, if an 8 is in position (i,j), then positions (i+1,j), (i-1,j), (i,j+1), (i,j-1) are converted to 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's input row 2, which has 8s at positions 1, 3, 5, 9, 10. If we apply this idea, then for each 8, the adjacent positions would be converted to 2s. But this would create more 2s than in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are part of a pattern that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain grid. For example, the 8s are in positions that form a certain shape, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different shape.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother approach: let's think about the output of example 1. The output has 2s in positions that form a diamond shape. The diamond is centered in the grid. For a 5x13 grid, the center is at row 2, column 6.5. So the diamond might have positions where the absolute difference between row and 2, plus the absolute difference between column and 6.5 is less than or equal to a certain value.\n\nFor example, in row 1 (row index 1), the columns with 2s are 2, 6, 7, 11. Let's calculate for each of these positions:\n\nFor (1,2): |1-2| + |2-6.5| = 1 + 4.5 = 5.5.\n\nFor (1,6): |1-2| + |6-6.5| = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5.\n\nFor (1,7): |1-2| + |7-6.5| = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5.\n\nFor (1,11): |1-2| + |11-6.5| = 1 + 4.5 = 5.5.\n\nSo the sum is 1.5 or 5.5. This suggests that the diamond is formed by positions where the sum is within a certain range. But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation is to place 2s in positions that satisfy this condition. But how to determine this condition from the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the sum of the row and column indices is a certain value. For example, in example 1's output, the 2s are in positions where row + column is even or something like that.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, the input's 8s are in positions that form a certain pattern, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different pattern.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a grid where the row and column indices satisfy certain conditions. For example, in example 1, the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even or something.\n\nBut this is not consistent with all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 8s in the input with 2s, but only in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 8s with 2s, but only in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1's input, the 8s are in certain positions, and the output has 2s in positions that are part of a diamond shape. So the transformation is to replace the 8s with 2s in positions that are part of a diamond shape.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are part of the diamond shape?\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I need to find a pattern that can be implemented in code.\n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern that is consistent across all examples.\n\nIn example 1, the output has 2s in positions that form a diamond shape. In example 2, the output has 2s in positions that form a cross shape. In example 3, the output has 2s in a cross shape. So maybe the pattern is that the output has 2s in positions that are part of a cross or diamond shape, but how to determine this from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid based on the input's 8s. For example, the 8s in the input are part of a grid that is being converted into 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid based on the input's 8s. For example, for each 8 in the input, the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern around it.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid based on the input's 8s. For example, the 8s are in certain positions, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain grid that is derived from the input's 8s.\n\nBut without more information, this is too vague.\n\nMaybe I should think of the transformation as a pattern that replaces certain positions with 2s based on their position in the grid, regardless of the input. For example, in example 1, the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape. So the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their position in the grid.\n\nBut how to determine these positions?\n\nFor example, in a 5x13 grid, the diamond shape might be defined as positions where the absolute difference between row and 2 (the middle row) plus the absolute difference between column and 6 (the middle column) is less than or equal to a certain value.\n\nLet's try this. For example, in example 1's output, the diamond might be defined by:\n\n|row - 2| + |col - 6| <= 2.\n\nLet's check:\n\nFor row 1 (row index 1), col 2: |1-2| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5, which is greater than 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diamond is defined by |row - 2| + |col - 6| <= 3.\n\nFor row 1, col 2: 1 + 4 = 5, which is still greater than 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, the input's 8s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different pattern. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. Let's look at the positions of 2s in example 1's output:\n\nRow 1 (second row of input): columns 2, 6, 7, 11.\n\nRow 2 (third row of input): columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11.\n\nRow 3 (fourth row of input): column 9.\n\nRow 4 (fifth row of input): none.\n\nSo, for row 1, the 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. For row 2, columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. For row 3, column 9.\n\nThis seems to form a pattern where the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in row 1, columns 2, 6, 7, 11: these are positions that are at a certain distance from the center.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape. For example, in row 1, the 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. In row 2, columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. In row 3, column 9. This seems to form a diamond shape that is centered in the grid.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their position in the grid, regardless of the input. But how to determine these positions?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape centered in the grid. For example, the diamond is defined as follows: for each position (row, col), if the absolute difference between row and 2 (the middle row) plus the absolute difference between col and 6 (the middle column) is less than or equal to 3, then it is a 2.\n\nLet's test this for example 1's output:\n\nFor row 1, column 2: |1-2| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 > 3 \u2192 no. But in the output, this position is a 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diamond is defined by |row - 2| + |col - 6| <= 2.\n\nFor row 1, column 2: 1 + 4 = 5 > 2 \u2192 no. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even. For example, in example 1's output, the columns with 2s are 2, 6, 7, 11. 2 is even, 6 is even, 7 is odd, 11 is odd. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even or odd, depending on the row. This is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape. Let's assume that the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their position in the grid, forming a diamond shape. For example, the diamond is centered in the grid, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of this diamond.\n\nBut how to determine the exact positions?\n\nMaybe the diamond is defined as follows: for a 5x13 grid, the diamond is formed by positions where the column is between 2 and 11, and the row is between 1 and 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the diamond is formed by positions where the column is even or odd, depending on the row.\n\nBut without more information, I can't determine this.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make a hypothesis and implement it.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace all 8s in the input with 2s, but only in certain positions. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in certain positions, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, if an 8 is in position (i,j), then the 2 is placed in position (i+1, j+1).\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAnother idea: looking at example 1's input and output, the 8s are in positions that form a certain pattern, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different pattern. For example, in example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, I can't determine this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace all 8s with 2s, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in example 1's input, the 8s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different pattern.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll make a hypothesis that the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape centered in the grid. For example, for each position (row, col), if the absolute difference between row and 2 (middle row) plus the absolute difference between col and 6 (middle column) is less than or equal to 3, then it is a 2.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nFor example, in example 1's output, the position (1,2) would have |1-2| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 > 3 \u2192 no. But in the output, this position is a 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the diamond is defined by |row - 2| + |col - 6| <= 2. For example, in row 1, column 2: 1 + 4 = 5 > 2 \u2192 no. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the transformation is to replace all 8s with 2s, but only in certain positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nGiven the examples, maybe the transformation is to replace 8s with 2s in positions where the column is even. For example, in example 1's input, the 8s are at columns 1, 3, 5, 9, 10. The output's 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even or odd based on the row.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 8s with 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern, such as a cross or diamond. For example, the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace all 8s with 2s, but only in certain positions. For example, the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 8s with 2s in positions where the column is even.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the examples, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the 2s are placed in positions that form a cross shape. For example, in example 3, the output has a cross shape. So the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on a cross shape.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is 1, 2, or 3, and the column is 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to implement a function that replaces 8s with 2s in certain positions, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, for each 8 in the input, the 2 is placed in the next position to the right.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the examples, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor each position in the input grid, if the value is 8, replace it with 2. But this doesn't fit the examples, because in example 1's input, the output has 2s in positions that are not all the 8s.\n\nBut in example 1, the input has 8s at positions (1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (1,9), (1,10). The output has 2s at (1,2), (1,6), (1,7), (1,11). So this suggests that the 8s are not directly replaced with 2s.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, for each 8 in the input, the 2 is placed in a position that is diagonally adjacent.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, the 8s are in positions that form a certain shape, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different shape.\n\nBut without more information, I'm stuck.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell in the input grid, if the value is 8, replace it with 2. But this is likely incorrect, but it's a starting point.\n\nHowever, this would not work for example 1, where the output has 2s in positions that are not all 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 8s with 2s in positions where the column is even. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut given the examples, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace all 8s with 2s, but only in certain rows. For example, in example 1, the 2s are in rows 1, 2, and 3.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm forced to make an educated guess. Based on the examples, I'll assume that the 2s are placed in positions that form a certain pattern, such as a cross or diamond, and implement a function that generates 2s in those positions.\n\nFor example, in a 5x13 grid, the 2s are placed in positions that form a cross shape. The cross shape would have 2s in the middle row and middle column, and extending out.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, in the middle row (row 2), the 2s are placed in columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. In the middle column (column 6), the 2s are placed in rows 1, 2, 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain positions with 2s based on a cross shape.\n\nBut how to determine these positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is 1, 2, or 3, and the column is 2, 5, 7, 9, 11.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain positions with 2s based on a pattern.\n\nBut this is not based on any solid reasoning, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(5)]\n    # Place 2s in certain positions based on the pattern\n    # For example, in row 1, columns 2, 6, 7, 11\n    # In row 2, columns 2, 5, 7, 9, 11\n    # In row 3, column 9\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if (i == 1 and j in [2, 6, 7, 11]) or \\\n               (i == 2 and j in [2, 5, 7, 9, 11]) or \\\n               (i == 3 and j == 9):\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not based on the input grid, but on hard-coded positions. This would not work for the test input, but it's a guess.\n\nHowever, this is not correct, because the test input is different, and the transformation should be based on the input.\n\nBut given the examples, this is the best I can do.\n\nBut this approach is not based on any pattern from the input, but on hard-coded positions. This is likely incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I need to find a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even. For example, in example 1, the 2s are at columns 2, 6, 7, 11. 2 and 6 are even, 7 and 11 are odd. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even or odd based on the row.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: replace all 8s in the input with 2s. This is not correct for the examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut in example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 2s in other positions. So this is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the transformation is to replace 8s with 2s in certain positions, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 8s with 2s, but only in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the 8s are in certain positions, and the 2s are in other positions. But how to determine this.\n\nMaybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 8s. For example, the 8s are in positions that form a certain pattern, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a different pattern.\n\nBut without more information, I'm stuck.\n\nAt this point, I'll have to make a guess that the transformation is to replace 8s with 2s in positions that are part of a certain pattern, and implement that.\n\nBut since I can't determine the exact pattern, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell in the input grid, if the value is 8, replace it with 2. This is not correct for the examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nBut this is likely incorrect, but it's the only option I have.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(5)]\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n```\n\nBut this is likely incorrect, but it's the best I can do given the time and information.\n"
