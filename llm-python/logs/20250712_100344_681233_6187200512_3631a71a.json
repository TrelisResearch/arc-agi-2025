          "Analysis:\n\n- The input and output grids are all 30\u00d730.\n- The outputs mostly retain the same overall circular/radial pattern as the inputs.\n- The key difference appears to be that in the output:\n  - Large solid/colorful blocks (especially dark red/brown) found in the input grids are removed or replaced by the background color (mostly 0 or black).\n  - These large blocks appear as artifact \"patches\" disrupting the circular/radial pattern.\n  - The complex, fine patterns with checkered or alternating colors remain intact.\n- Visually, the output shows a cleaner, more symmetrical circular/radial pattern without these \"overlaid\" blocky patches.\n- It looks like the patches of a particular color (dark red or similar) that break the pattern are erased/replaced with the background color.\n- In the second example, bunches of 9\u2019s (dark color) that form large blocks are replaced selectively.\n- In the third and fourth examples, blocks of the color corresponding to red/dark brown are erased to reveal underlying symmetrical structures.\n- Smaller shapes and line structures are left untouched.\n- The output looks like the input with the large solid patch(es) removed (replaced with the background, usually 0).\n- The outputs preserve the same size (30\u00d730) and keep the patterns inside intact.\n\n**Hypothesis for implementation:**\n\n- Identify the large connected components of \"patch\" colors that disrupt circular/radial symmetry.\n- Most of these seem to be the largest connected components of the color \"8\" or \"9\" or \"6\" (or similar) representing those block colors.\n- Remove the largest connected components of dark or patch colors by replacing their pixels with 0 (background).\n- Leave all other pixels unchanged.\n- This produces the cleaner circular patterns seen in outputs.\n\n**Implementation approach:**\n\n- For each input grid:\n  - Identify the set of colors that appear as large patches.\n    - Candidate colors: 6,7,8,9 (based on input observations).\n  - Find connected components of these colors.\n  - Replace the largest connected component(s) with 0.\n- Return the cleaned grid.\n\nThis approach partially explains each training example\u2019s change and yields output grids that resemble the provided outputs.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = grid.shape\n    \n    # Candidate patch colors observed in training inputs to remove:\n    patch_colors = [6,7,8,9]\n    \n    # Background color to fill removed patches (observed as 0)\n    bg = 0\n    \n    # To mark processed cells\n    visited = np.zeros((h,w), dtype=bool)\n    \n    def neighbors(r,c):\n        for nr,nc in [(r-1,c),(r+1,c),(r,c-1),(r,c+1)]:\n            if 0 <= nr < h and 0 <= nc < w:\n                yield nr,nc\n    \n    # Find all connected components for patch colors, replace largest by bg\n    for color in patch_colors:\n        # Find connected components of `color`\n        visited[:] = False\n        for i in range(h):\n            for j in range(w):\n                if not visited[i,j] and grid[i,j] == color:\n                    # BFS to get connected component\n                    q = deque()\n                    q.append((i,j))\n                    component = []\n                    visited[i,j] = True\n                    while q:\n                        r,c = q.popleft()\n                        component.append((r,c))\n                        for nr,nc in neighbors(r,c):\n                            if not visited[nr,nc] and grid[nr,nc] == color:\n                                visited[nr,nc] = True\n                                q.append((nr,nc))\n                    # If the connected component is large (threshold), remove it\n                    # Threshold: heuristically set to 30 pixels (about 1/30th area)\n                    if len(component) > 30:\n                        for (rr,cc) in component:\n                            grid[rr,cc] = bg\n    \n    # Return result as list of lists\n    return grid.tolist()\n```\n"

              "Analysis:\n\n- The input and output grids are all 30\u00d730.\n- The outputs mostly retain the same overall circular/radial pattern as the inputs.\n- The key difference appears to be that in the output:\n  - Large solid/colorful blocks (especially dark red/brown) found in the input grids are removed or replaced by the background color (mostly 0 or black).\n  - These large blocks appear as artifact \"patches\" disrupting the circular/radial pattern.\n  - The complex, fine patterns with checkered or alternating colors remain intact.\n- Visually, the output shows a cleaner, more symmetrical circular/radial pattern without these \"overlaid\" blocky patches.\n- It looks like the patches of a particular color (dark red or similar) that break the pattern are erased/replaced with the background color.\n- In the second example, bunches of 9\u2019s (dark color) that form large blocks are replaced selectively.\n- In the third and fourth examples, blocks of the color corresponding to red/dark brown are erased to reveal underlying symmetrical structures.\n- Smaller shapes and line structures are left untouched.\n- The output looks like the input with the large solid patch(es) removed (replaced with the background, usually 0).\n- The outputs preserve the same size (30\u00d730) and keep the patterns inside intact.\n\n**Hypothesis for implementation:**\n\n- Identify the large connected components of \"patch\" colors that disrupt circular/radial symmetry.\n- Most of these seem to be the largest connected components of the color \"8\" or \"9\" or \"6\" (or similar) representing those block colors.\n- Remove the largest connected components of dark or patch colors by replacing their pixels with 0 (background).\n- Leave all other pixels unchanged.\n- This produces the cleaner circular patterns seen in outputs.\n\n**Implementation approach:**\n\n- For each input grid:\n  - Identify the set of colors that appear as large patches.\n    - Candidate colors: 6,7,8,9 (based on input observations).\n  - Find connected components of these colors.\n  - Replace the largest connected component(s) with 0.\n- Return the cleaned grid.\n\nThis approach partially explains each training example\u2019s change and yields output grids that resemble the provided outputs.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = grid.shape\n    \n    # Candidate patch colors observed in training inputs to remove:\n    patch_colors = [6,7,8,9]\n    \n    # Background color to fill removed patches (observed as 0)\n    bg = 0\n    \n    # To mark processed cells\n    visited = np.zeros((h,w), dtype=bool)\n    \n    def neighbors(r,c):\n        for nr,nc in [(r-1,c),(r+1,c),(r,c-1),(r,c+1)]:\n            if 0 <= nr < h and 0 <= nc < w:\n                yield nr,nc\n    \n    # Find all connected components for patch colors, replace largest by bg\n    for color in patch_colors:\n        # Find connected components of `color`\n        visited[:] = False\n        for i in range(h):\n            for j in range(w):\n                if not visited[i,j] and grid[i,j] == color:\n                    # BFS to get connected component\n                    q = deque()\n                    q.append((i,j))\n                    component = []\n                    visited[i,j] = True\n                    while q:\n                        r,c = q.popleft()\n                        component.append((r,c))\n                        for nr,nc in neighbors(r,c):\n                            if not visited[nr,nc] and grid[nr,nc] == color:\n                                visited[nr,nc] = True\n                                q.append((nr,nc))\n                    # If the connected component is large (threshold), remove it\n                    # Threshold: heuristically set to 30 pixels (about 1/30th area)\n                    if len(component) > 30:\n                        for (rr,cc) in component:\n                            grid[rr,cc] = bg\n    \n    # Return result as list of lists\n    return grid.tolist()\n```\n"
