The output grid often has values that are the same as the input grid, but with some values modified.\n2. Values that are 0 in the input often become 0 in the output.\n3. Values that are 1 in the input often become 1 in the output.\n4. Values that are 2 in the input often become 2 in the output.\n5. Values that are 3 in the input often become 3 in the output.\n6. Values that are 4 in the input often become 4 in the output.\n7. Values that are 5 in the input often become 5 in the output.\n8. Values that are 6 in the input often become 6 in the output.\n9. Values that are 7 in the input often become 7 in the output.\n10. Values that are 8 in the input often become 8 in the output.\n11. Values that are 9 in the input often become 9 in the output.\n\nHowever, there are some patterns that suggest the transformation might be more complex. For example, in Example 1, the value 3 in the input becomes 3 in the output, but the value 7 in the input becomes 7 in the output. This suggests that the transformation might be more about preserving values rather than modifying them.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that preserves the values in the input grid, as this seems to be the most consistent pattern across the examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Return a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
