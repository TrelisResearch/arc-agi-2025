    "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to identify the transformation pattern.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input has 8s at positions (3,1), (3,6), (7,4), (9,6)\n- Output shows horizontal lines extending from some 8s, and vertical lines from others\n\nExample 2:\n- Input has 8s at positions (1,7), (3,2), (6,5), (6,9), (8,2)\n- Output shows vertical lines extending downward from some 8s\n\nExample 3:\n- Input has 8s at positions (1,1), (1,5), (4,1), (7,5), (7,9), (9,2)\n- Output shows horizontal lines extending rightward from some 8s, and what appears to be rectangular shapes\n\nLet me look more carefully at the patterns:\n- It seems like 8s are being connected by lines\n- Some 8s have horizontal lines extending right\n- Some 8s have vertical lines extending down\n- The pattern might depend on the relative positions of 8s\n\nLooking at Example 1 more carefully:\n- From (3,1): horizontal line to the right\n- From (3,6): horizontal line to the right, then vertical line down\n- From (7,4): seems to connect to (9,6) diagonally? Or vertical down then horizontal?\n\nLet me try a different approach - maybe it's about connecting 8s with paths:\n- Connect 8s that are in the same row or column\n- Draw lines between them\n\nActually, let me look at what specific cells are being filled:\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Horizontal line from (3,1) to (3,6): fills (3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(3,5)\n- From (3,6): vertical line down through (4,6),(5,6),(6,6)\n- From (7,4): connects somehow to (9,6)\n\nLet me try to see if it's about drawing orthogonal paths between 8s:\n1. Find all positions of 8s\n2. Connect them with the shortest orthogonal paths (like in a grid)\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n- From (1,1): horizontal right to (1,5), filling (1,2),(1,3),(1,4)\n- From (1,1): vertical down, and from (1,5): vertical down\n- From (7,5): horizontal right to (7,9), filling in between\n\nThis looks like it's drawing rectangles or L-shapes to connect the dots.\n\nLet me try to formalize a hypothesis:\n1. Find all 8 positions\n2. For each pair of 8s, draw orthogonal paths (right-angle connections)\n3. But that's still vague\n\nLet me look at a simpler interpretation:\n- Some 8s have horizontal lines extending right until they hit something or reach a column\n- Some 8s have vertical lines extending down until they hit something or reach a row\n- The pattern might depend on whether there are other 8s in the same row/column\n\nActually, let me try a more direct approach:\n- For each 8, extend lines in certain directions based on context\n- If there's another 8 to the right in the same row, draw horizontal line\n- If there's another 8 below in the same column, draw vertical line\n\nLet me check this with Example 1:\n- (3,1): Another 8 at (3,6) in same row \u2192 draw horizontal line from (3,1) to (3,6)\n- (3,6): Has (7,4) below it but not in same column, (9,6) below it in same column \u2192 draw vertical line down\n- (7,4): Has (9,6) - not in same row or column, but (9,6) is below and to the right\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me try a simpler rule:\n- For each 8, draw horizontal lines to the right until edge of grid or another 8 in same row\n- For each 8, draw vertical lines down until edge of grid or another 8 in same column\n\nChecking Example 1:\n- (3,1): Another 8 at (3,6) \u2192 draw horizontal from (3,1) to (3,5) - matches\n- (3,6): No other 8 in same column below it in visible range \u2192 but output shows vertical line\n- Wait, (9,6) is another 8 in same column \u2192 draw vertical line from (3,6) down to (8,6) - matches output\n\nLet me try this approach systematically:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import copy\n    \n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    result = copy.deepcopy(grid)\n    \n    # Find all positions of 8s\n    eights = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                eights.append((i, j))\n    \n    # For each 8, draw lines\n    for row, col in eights:\n        # Draw horizontal line to the right until we find another 8 in same row or reach edge\n        # Check if there's another 8 to the right in the same row\n        found_eight_right = False\n        rightmost_col = col\n        for c in range(col + 1, 10):\n            if grid[row][c] == 8:\n                found_eight_right = True\n                rightmost_col = c\n                break\n        \n        # If found another 8 to the right, draw horizontal line\n        if found_eight_right:\n            for c in range(col + 1, rightmost_col):\n                result[row][c] = 8\n        \n        # Draw vertical line down until we find another 8 in same column or reach edge\n        # Check if there's another 8 below in the same column\n        found_eight_below = False\n        bottommost_row = row\n        for r in range(row + 1, 10):\n            if grid[r][col] == 8:\n                found_eight_below = True\n                bottommost_row = r\n                break\n        \n        # If found another 8 below, draw vertical line\n        if found_eight_below:\n            for r in range(row + 1, bottommost_row):\n                result[r][col] = 8\n    \n    return result\n```",

Some 8s spawn vertical lines (extending downward)\n2. Some 8s spawn horizontal lines (extending rightward)\n3. Some 8s create L-shaped or more complex connections\n4. The patterns seem to depend on the relative positions of the 8s\n\nLet me try to identify a rule:\n- It appears that 8s connect to other 8s through orthogonal paths (horizontal or vertical lines)\n- The connections seem to avoid crossing and follow a kind of \"wire routing\" logic\n\nLooking more systematically:\n- In example 1: The 8 at (3,1) extends right to column 6, then down to connect to the 8 at (3,6)\n- The 8 at (7,4) extends down and right to connect to the 8 at (9,6)\n\nLet me implement a solution that tries to connect 8s with orthogonal paths:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import copy\n    \n    # Create a deep copy of the input grid for the output\n    result = copy.deepcopy(grid)\n    \n    # Find all positions with 8s\n    eights = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                eights.append((i, j))\n    \n    # If there are less than 2 eights, no connections needed\n    if len(eights) < 2:\n        return result\n    \n    # Connect consecutive pairs of 8s with orthogonal paths\n    for k in range(len(eights) - 1):\n        r1, c1 = eights[k]\n        r2, c2 = eights[k + 1]\n        \n        # Draw horizontal line first (left to right)\n        start_col = min(c1, c2)\n        end_col = max(c1, c2)\n        for col in range(start_col, end_col + 1):\n            result[r1][col] = 8\n            \n        # Draw vertical line (top to bottom)\n        start_row = min(r1, r2)\n        end_row = max(r1, r2)\n        for row in range(start_row, end_row + 1):\n            result[row][c2] = 8\n    \n    return result\n```",

Connect them with the shortest orthogonal paths (like in a grid)\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n- From (1,1): horizontal right to (1,5), filling (1,2),(1,3),(1,4)\n- From (1,1): vertical down, and from (1,5): vertical down\n- From (7,5): horizontal right to (7,9), filling in between\n\nThis looks like it's drawing rectangles or L-shapes to connect the dots.\n\nLet me try to formalize a hypothesis:\n1. Find all 8 positions\n2. For each pair of 8s, draw orthogonal paths (right-angle connections)\n3. But that's still vague\n\nLet me look at a simpler interpretation:\n- Some 8s have horizontal lines extending right until they hit something or reach a column\n- Some 8s have vertical lines extending down until they hit something or reach a row\n- The pattern might depend on whether there are other 8s in the same row/column\n\nActually, let me try a more direct approach:\n- For each 8, extend lines in certain directions based on context\n- If there's another 8 to the right in the same row, draw horizontal line\n- If there's another 8 below in the same column, draw vertical line\n\nLet me check this with Example 1:\n- (3,1): Another 8 at (3,6) in same row \u2192 draw horizontal line from (3,1) to (3,6)\n- (3,6): Has (7,4) below it but not in same column, (9,6) below it in same column \u2192 draw vertical line down\n- (7,4): Has (9,6) - not in same row or column, but (9,6) is below and to the right\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me try a simpler rule:\n- For each 8, draw horizontal lines to the right until edge of grid or another 8 in same row\n- For each 8, draw vertical lines down until edge of grid or another 8 in same column\n\nChecking Example 1:\n- (3,1): Another 8 at (3,6) \u2192 draw horizontal from (3,1) to (3,5) - matches\n- (3,6): No other 8 in same column below it in visible range \u2192 but output shows vertical line\n- Wait, (9,6) is another 8 in same column \u2192 draw vertical line from (3,6) down to (8,6) - matches output\n\nLet me try this approach systematically:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import copy\n    \n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    result = copy.deepcopy(grid)\n    \n    # Find all positions of 8s\n    eights = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                eights.append((i, j))\n    \n    # For each 8, draw lines\n    for row, col in eights:\n        # Draw horizontal line to the right until we find another 8 in same row or reach edge\n        # Check if there's another 8 to the right in the same row\n        found_eight_right = False\n        rightmost_col = col\n        for c in range(col + 1, 10):\n            if grid[row][c] == 8:\n                found_eight_right = True\n                rightmost_col = c\n                break\n        \n        # If found another 8 to the right, draw horizontal line\n        if found_eight_right:\n            for c in range(col + 1, rightmost_col):\n                result[row][c] = 8\n        \n        # Draw vertical line down until we find another 8 in same column or reach edge\n        # Check if there's another 8 below in the same column\n        found_eight_below = False\n        bottommost_row = row\n        for r in range(row + 1, 10):\n            if grid[r][col] == 8:\n                found_eight_below = True\n                bottommost_row = r\n                break\n        \n        # If found another 8 below, draw vertical line\n        if found_eight_below:\n            for r in range(row + 1, bottommost_row):\n                result[r][col] = 8\n    \n    return result\n```",
