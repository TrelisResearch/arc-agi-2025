          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some rows with 0s and 5s, and the output seems to have more 1s and 2s in certain positions. For instance, the first row of the input is 1 5 1 5 5 2 5 5 5 1, and the output's first row is the same. So maybe the first row is unchanged? But looking at the second row of the input: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output for that row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. Hmm, so the 5s are in the same positions, but the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. Wait, maybe it's about replacing 0s with some values based on neighboring cells?\n\nLooking at the second row of the input, the 0s are in columns 0,1,2,5,8,9. The output for those positions is 1,1,1,2,2,2. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the surrounding cells. Let me check the third row of the input. The input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are being replaced with 1s and 2s again. Maybe the 0s are being converted to 1s if they are in certain positions or based on the values around them.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 1, the second row starts with 1s and then 5, then 2s. The third row has 1s, then 5, then 2s. The fourth row is similar. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value in the same column of the previous row? Or maybe based on the value in the same column of the next row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with values that depend on the surrounding cells. For example, in the second row of input, the 0s are in positions 0,1,2,5,8,9. The output for those positions is 1,1,1,2,2,2. Let me check the first row. The first row has 1,5,1,5,5,2,5,5,5,1. So for column 0, the first row is 1, and the second row's column 0 is 1. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value from the row above if it's non-zero? But in the second row's column 0, the input is 0, but the output is 1. The first row's column 0 is 1. So maybe if the cell above is non-zero, then the current cell is set to that value? But then, in the second row's column 5, the input is 0, and the output is 2. The first row's column 5 is 2. So that seems to fit. But what about the third row's column 5? The input is 0, and the output is 2. The first row's column 5 is 2. So maybe that's the pattern: if a cell is 0, replace it with the value from the cell above it, but only if that cell is non-zero?\n\nBut wait, in the second row, column 5 is 0, and the output is 2. The first row's column 5 is 2. So that's consistent. Similarly, the third row's column 5 is 0, and the output is 2. The first row's column 5 is 2. So that seems to be the case. But then, what about the third row's column 0? The input is 0, and the output is 1. The first row's column 0 is 1. So that seems to fit. So maybe for each 0 in the input, the output is the value from the cell above it, but only if that cell is non-zero. But what if the cell above is zero? Then maybe it's replaced with something else?\n\nBut looking at Example 2. Let's check that. For example, in the input of Example 2, the first row is 2 5 5 5 1 5 5 5 5 2. The output's first row is the same. So the first row remains unchanged. Then the second row of input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. So the 0s in the second row are being replaced with 1s, except where there's a 5. For example, column 0: input is 0, output is 1. The cell above (first row's column 0 is 2, which is non-zero. So maybe the 0s are replaced with the value from the cell above if it's non-zero. But in the second row's column 3, the input is 0, and the output is 1. The cell above (first row's column 3 is 5. So that's not matching. Wait, but in that case, maybe the cell above is not the one being used. Maybe it's the cell to the left or right?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, or something like that. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero. Let's check in Example 1's second row. The second row's input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The first three columns are 0s, and the output is 1s. The fourth column is 5. Then column 5 is 0, output is 2. The cell to the left (column 4) is 0, which is not helpful. Hmm. Maybe the value from the cell above?\n\nIn Example 1's second row, column 0 is 0, and the output is 1. The cell above (row 0, column 0) is 1. So maybe the 0s are replaced with the value from the cell above if it's non-zero. Then, for column 5, the cell above is 2. So output is 2. That seems to fit. For column 5 in the second row, the input is 0, output is 2. The cell above is 2. So that's correct.\n\nIn Example 2's second row, the input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. The third column is 5, which is same as input. For the first column (0), the output is 1. The cell above is 2 (first row, column 0). So that fits. For the second column (0), output is 1. The cell above is 5 (first row, column 1). So that's 5, but output is 1. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value from the cell to the left. For example, in the second row of Example 1, the first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing. But the cell to the right is 0. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with the value of the cell to the right. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero. For example, in the second row of Example 1, the first three columns are 0. The first column is 0, and the cell to the left is nothing. But the cell to the right is 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is non-zero. But in Example 2's second row, column 1 is 0. The cell above is 5. So the output is 1. But why 1? Because the cell above is 5, but the output is 1. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero. Let's check in Example 1's second row. The first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing. So maybe not. But the second column is 0. The cell to the left is 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if there's a 5 in the same row or column. For example, in Example 1's second row, the 0s are in positions where there's a 5 in the same row. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the previous row, but if that's zero, then something else. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The previous row (row 0) has 1. So output is 1. For the second row's column 5, the previous row's column 5 is 2. So output is 2. That seems to fit. But in Example 2's second row, column 1 is 0. The previous row's column 1 is 5. So output is 1. But that's not matching. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is non-zero, and 2s if the cell above is 5. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. The 1s are in the first three columns and the last two columns. The 2s are in columns 5 and 8. Wait, the second row of output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. So columns 0-2 are 1, column 3 is 5, columns 4-6 are 2, column 7 is 5, columns 8-9 are 2. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the same column as a 5 in the previous row, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then maybe the cell to the left or right. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at Example 3. Let's see. The input's second row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced with 2s. The third row of input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 5 2 2 2. So again, 0s are replaced with 2s. The first row of input is 1 5 2 5 2 5 5 5 5 1. The output is same as input. So perhaps the 0s are being replaced with 2s if they are in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell to the left or right. For example, in Example 1, the second row's first three columns are 0s. The output is 1s. The cell to the left of the first column is nothing. But the cell to the right is 0. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is non-zero. But in Example 2's second row, the first column is 0, and the cell above is 2 (non-zero), so output is 1. The second column is 0, cell above is 5, output is 1. So that doesn't fit. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero. Let's check Example 1's second row. The first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing. So maybe not. But the second column is 0. The cell to the left is 0. So that's not helpful. The third column is 0. The cell to the left is 0. So that's not helpful. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the right is non-zero. For example, in the second row of Example 1, the first column is 0. The cell to the right is 0. So that's not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 5 is 0. The row below (third row) has 0 in column 5. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if there's a 5 in the same row. For example, in Example 1's second row, the 0s are in positions where there's a 5 in the same row. But the second row of input has 5 in column 3 and 7. The 0s are in columns 0,1,2,5,8,9. So for column 5, the 0 is replaced with 2. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell in the same column of the row above. If that cell is 1, replace with 1. If it's 2, replace with 2. If it's 5, replace with 1 or 2 based on something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that cell is zero, then the value of the cell to the left. But that's getting too complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have 1s and 2s replacing the 0s. In Example 2, the output has 1s and 5s. Wait, in Example 2's output, the second row is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. So the 0s are replaced with 1s. The third row is 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1. So all 0s are replaced with 1s. The fourth row is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. So again, 0s replaced with 1s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first three columns are 0s. The cell to the left of the first column is nothing. But the cell to the left of the second column is 0. So that doesn't fit. But the third column is 0. The cell to the left is 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is non-zero. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first column is 0, and the cell above is 1. So output is 1. The second column is 0, cell above is 5. Output is 1. So that's not matching. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing. So maybe not. But the second column is 0. The cell to the left is 0. So not helpful.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me look for another pattern. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 5 is 0. The row below (third row) is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So column 5 is 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same row, but to the right. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 0 is 0. The cell to the right is 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell in the same row to the left is non-zero. For example, in the second row of Example 1, the first three columns are 0s. The first column's left is nothing. So maybe not. The second column's left is 0. So not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The first three columns are 1s. The next is 5, then 2s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the first three columns, and 2s if they are in other positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation involves some kind of erosion or dilation of the 0s. For example, replacing 0s with 1s or 2s based on the surrounding values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1's second row: the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. The 1s are in positions where the cell above is 1 or 5. The 2s are where the cell above is 2. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if there's a 5 in the same row or column. For example, in the second row of Example 1, there are 5s in column 3 and 7. So the 0s around them are replaced with 1s or 2s. But that's not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the minimum of the surrounding cells. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then the cell in the same column of the row below. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the second row is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the input's second row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 0s are replaced with 2s. The third row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 5 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced with 2s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 2s if the cell above is 2 or 5. But in the second row of Example 3, the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. The cell above (row 0) is 1 5 2 5 2 5 5 5 5 1. So the cell in column 6 is 5. So the 0 in column 6 of row 1 is replaced with 2. So that's not matching. But the cell above is 5. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 2 if the cell above is 5 or 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is non-zero, and 2s if the cell above is 5. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 0 is 0. The cell above is 1 (non-zero), so replaced with 1. Column 5 is 0, cell above is 2, replaced with 2. Column 8 is 0, cell above is 5 (row 0, column 8 is 5), replaced with 5? But in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output of the examples. In Example 1, the output seems to have 1s and 2s replacing the 0s. In Example 2, the output has 1s and 5s. In Example 3, the output has 2s and 5s. So maybe the replacement depends on the surrounding values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 5 is 0. The cell above is 2 (row 0, column 5 is 2). So replaced with 2. That fits. For the third row of Example 1, column 5 is 0. The cell above is 2 (row 2, column 5 is 0?), wait the input for Example 1's third row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the cell above (row 2, column 5 is 0). The cell below (row 3, column 5 is 0). So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if there's a 5 in the same row, and 2s otherwise. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that cell is 0, then the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above if it's non-zero, otherwise 1. But that would explain some cases. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 0 is 0. The cell above is 1, so replaced with 1. Column 5 is 0. The cell above is 2, replaced with 2. Column 8 is 0. The cell above is 5, replaced with 5. But in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output of the examples. For example, in Example 1, the second row of output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The third row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. The fourth row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. So the 0s in the second row are replaced with 1s and 2s. The third row's 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. It seems like there's a spread of values from the 0s, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. But how would that work?\n\nLet me try to think of a possible transformation rule. Suppose that for each cell in the input grid, if it's 0, then replace it with the value from the cell above it. If the cell above is also 0, then replace it with the value from the cell below. But that's just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1's second row, column 0 is 0. The cell above is 1, so replaced with 1. Column 5 is 0. Cell above is 2, replaced with 2. Column 8 is 0. Cell above is 5, replaced with 5. But in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and 1 otherwise. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first three columns are 0. The cell to the left of the first column is nothing, so replaced with 1. The cell to the left of the second column is 0, so replaced with 1. The third column is 0, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. Then the fourth column is 5, so no change. The fifth column is 0. The cell to the left is 5, so replaced with 5? But the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the output of the examples. For instance, in Example 1, the output's second row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The third row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. The fourth row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. So it seems like the 0s are being replaced with 1s and 2s based on the values in the previous rows. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2s if the cell above is 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is non-zero, and 2s if the cell above is 5. But in Example 1's second row, the cell above for column 5 is 2, so replaced with 2. For column 8, the cell above is 5, replaced with 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2s if the cell above is 2 or 5. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first three columns are 0. The cell to the left of the first column is nothing, so replaced with 1. The cell to the left of the second column is 0, replaced with 1. The cell to the left of the third column is 0, replaced with 1. The fourth column is 5. The fifth column is 0. The cell to the right is 0, so replaced with 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. For example, in the second row of Example 1, the first three columns are 0. The cell to the left of the first column is nothing, so replaced with 1. The cell to the left of the second column is 0, so replaced with 1. The cell to the left of the third column is 0, replaced with 1. The fourth column is 5. The fifth column is 0. The cell to the right is 0, so replaced with 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. This seems to fit some examples but not others.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, maybe I should think of another approach. Maybe the transformation involves some kind of erosion or dilation, where 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the surrounding cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if there's a 5 in the same row, and 2s otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. Let's try this with Example 1's second row. For column 0, the cell above is 1 (non-zero), so replaced with 1. Column 5, cell above is 2, replaced with 2. Column 8, cell above is 5 (row 0, column 8 is 5), replaced with 5. But in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as a combination of the input and some transformation based on the neighboring cells. For example, in Example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if there's a 5 in the same column above, and 2s otherwise. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. Let's try this for Example 1's second row. For the first column, cell to the left is nothing, so replaced with 1. Second column, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. Third column, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. Fourth column is 5. Fifth column, cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Sixth column, cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Seventh column, cell to the right is 5, replaced with 2. Eighth column, cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Ninth column, cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Tenth column, cell to the right is nothing, replaced with 2. This would give 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2, which matches the output. So this seems to fit for Example 1's second row.\n\nLet's check this for Example 2's second row. The input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. For the first column, cell to the left is nothing, replaced with 1. Second column, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. Third column is 5. Fourth column, cell to the left is 5, replaced with 1. Fifth column, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. Sixth column, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. Seventh column, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. Eighth column is 5. Ninth column, cell to the left is 5, replaced with 1. Tenth column, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. This gives 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1, which matches the output. So this seems to work.\n\nFor Example 3's second row: input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. Output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. Let's apply the rule: for each 0, replace with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, else 2. Wait, but in this case, the first three columns are 0. The cell to the left of the first column is nothing, so replaced with 2? But the output is 2. Let's see:\n\nFirst column: cell to the left is nothing. According to the rule, if the cell to the left is non-zero, replace with 1. Otherwise, maybe replace with 2. So for the first column, replaced with 2. Second column: cell to the left is 0, replaced with 2. Third column: cell to the left is 0, replaced with 2. Fourth column is 5. Fifth column: cell to the left is 5, replaced with 1? But the output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the rule might not be consistent. But in Example 3's second row, the output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. Let's see: for the fifth column, which is 0. The cell to the left is 5 (column 4). So according to the previous rule, replaced with 1. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo maybe the rule is different. Perhaps the 0s are replaced with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2 if the cell to the right is non-zero. Let's try that for Example 3's second row. \n\nFirst column: cell to the left is nothing, replaced with 2. Second column: cell to the left is 0, replaced with 2. Third column: cell to the left is 0, replaced with 2. Fourth column is 5. Fifth column: cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Sixth column: cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Seventh column: cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Eighth column: cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Ninth column: cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Tenth column: cell to the right is nothing, replaced with 2. This would give 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2, which matches the output. So this seems to work.\n\nSo the rule is: for each 0 in the input, replace it with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2 if the cell to the right is non-zero. If both are zero, then replace with 2? Or maybe if neither is non-zero, replace with 2.\n\nLet's test this for Example 1's second row. The first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing (so 0), and the cell to the right is 0. So according to this rule, replace with 2? But the output is 1. So this doesn't fit. Wait, but in Example 1's second row, the first three columns are 0, and the output is 1 1 1. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let's try to re-express the rule. Maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if there's a non-zero cell to the left, or 2 if there's a non-zero cell to the right. But if both are zero, then replace with 1 or 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: if the cell to the left is non-zero, replace with 1. Otherwise, if the cell to the right is non-zero, replace with 2. Otherwise, replace with 1 or 2 based on some other condition.\n\nBut this is getting too complex. Let's try to see for Example 1's second row. The first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing, so replaced with 1. The second column is 0. The cell to the left is 0, so check the cell to the right (0), replaced with 1. But the output is 1. So maybe if both are zero, replace with 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the rule is: if the cell to the left is non-zero, replace with 1. If the cell to the right is non-zero, replace with 2. Otherwise, replace with 1.\n\nBut in Example 1's second row, the first column has cell to the left as nothing, so replaced with 1. The second column has cell to the left as 0, but cell to the right is 0, so replaced with 1. The third column has cell to the left as 0, cell to the right as 5 (column 3 is 5). So replaced with 2. But in the output, the third column is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 0s with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. But in some cases, this might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. If both are zero, then replace with 1.\n\nLet's test this for Example 1's second row:\n\nFirst column: left is nothing, right is 0. So replaced with 1.\n\nSecond column: left is 0, right is 0. So replaced with 1.\n\nThird column: left is 0, right is 5. So replaced with 2. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if there's a 5 in the same row, and 2s otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to implement a rule that replaces 0s with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, otherwise 2. Let's see if that works for the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: left is nothing, replaced with 2. But output is 1. So no.\n\nBut in Example 2's second row, the first column is 0. Left is nothing, replaced with 2. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe the rule is to replace 0s with 1 if the cell above is non-zero, and 2 if the cell below is non-zero. Let's try this for Example 1's second row.\n\nColumn 0: cell above is 1 (non-zero), replaced with 1. Column 5: cell above is 2, replaced with 2. Column 8: cell above is 5, replaced with 5. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of the input and some pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have the same values as the input in certain rows, and for others, it's filled with 1s and 2s. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then the value of the cell in the same column of the row below.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe the rule is: for each cell (i,j), if the input is 0, then check the cell above (i-1,j). If that is non-zero, replace with that value. Otherwise, check the cell below (i+1,j). If that is non-zero, replace with that value. Otherwise, replace with 1.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: cell above is 1 \u2192 replace with 1.\n\nColumn 1: cell above is 5 \u2192 replace with 5? But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1 if the cell above is non-zero, and 2 if the cell below is non-zero. For Example 1's second row, column 0: cell above is 1 \u2192 replaced with 1. Column 5: cell above is 2 \u2192 replaced with 2. Column 8: cell above is 5 \u2192 replaced with 5. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too frustrating. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the second row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The third row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. The fourth row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. So it seems like the 0s in the second row are being replaced with 1s and 2s, and the 0s in the third row are being replaced with 1s and 2s. It looks like the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the first three columns, and 2s in other positions.\n\nMaybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. Let's try this for Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: left is nothing \u2192 replaced with 1. Column 1: left is 0 \u2192 replaced with 2? But the output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2 if the cell to the right is non-zero. For example, in the second row of Example 1, column 0: left is nothing \u2192 replaced with 1. Column 1: left is 0 \u2192 replaced with 2. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see. The most consistent pattern I've seen is that 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell to the left or right. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first three columns are 0, and the output is 1s. The fourth column is 5. The fifth column is 0, replaced with 2. The sixth column is 0, replaced with 2. The seventh column is 0, replaced with 2. The eighth column is 5. The ninth and tenth columns are 0, replaced with 2.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each 0 in the input, if the cell to the left is non-zero, replace with 1. If the cell to the right is non-zero, replace with 2. Otherwise, replace with 1.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: left is nothing \u2192 replaced with 1.\n\nColumn 1: left is 0 \u2192 right is 0 \u2192 replaced with 1.\n\nColumn 2: left is 0 \u2192 right is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. But the output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is not working.\n\nMaybe the rule is to replace 0 with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, else 2. Let's try this for Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: left is nothing \u2192 replaced with 2. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example 2's second row, the first column is 0. Left is nothing \u2192 replaced with 2. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that 0s are replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s otherwise. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it might be the best I can do.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each cell in the grid, if it is 0, replace it with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, else 2. If the cell to the left is zero, then check the cell to the right. If the cell to the right is non-zero, replace with 2. Otherwise, replace with 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's implement this and see.\n\nFor Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: left is nothing \u2192 replaced with 2. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if the cell above is non-zero, else 2. Let's try this for Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: cell above is 1 \u2192 replaced with 1.\n\nColumn 1: cell above is 5 \u2192 replaced with 5. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working. Given the time, I'll proceed with the assumption that the 0s are replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s otherwise. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if it's 0, check the cell to the left. If it's non-zero, replace with 1. Else, replace with 2.\n\nBut this would replace some 0s with 1 or 2 based on the left cell.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2's second row, the first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing, so replaced with 2. But the output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2 if the cell to the right is non-zero. If both are zero, then replace with 1.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: left is nothing, right is 0 \u2192 replaced with 1.\n\nColumn 1: left is 0, right is 0 \u2192 replaced with 1.\n\nColumn 2: left is 0, right is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2.\n\nColumn 5: left is 0, right is 0 \u2192 replaced with 1. But output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible hypothesis based on the examples, even if it's not perfect. The most consistent pattern I've seen is that 0s are replaced with 1s or 2s based on the cell above. For example, in Example 1's second row, the cell above is 1, so replaced with 1. The cell above is 2, replaced with 2. The cell above is 5, replaced with 2. This might suggest that if the cell above is non-zero, replace with 1 if it's 1 or 5, and 2 if it's 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess. So, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i, j), if the input is 0, then replace with the value of the cell above (i-1, j). If that is zero, replace with 1. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, replace 0 with 1 if the cell above is non-zero, and 2 if the cell above is 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell, if it's 0, replace it with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, else 2. This might not fit all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nNow, I'll write the code.\n\nThe function will iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, if it's 0, check the left cell. If the left cell is non-zero, replace with 1. Else, replace with 2.\n\nBut this might not work for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check left cell\n                if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] != 0:\n                    row.append(1)\n                else:\n                    row.append(2)\n            else:\n                row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this might not work for all examples. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first three columns are 0, and the left cell is 0, so replaced with 2. But the output is 1. So this code would not work for that.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, even if it's not perfect. It's possible that the actual pattern is more complex, but this is the best I can do based on the examples.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some rows with 0s and 5s, and the output seems to have more 1s and 2s in certain positions. For instance, the first row of the input is 1 5 1 5 5 2 5 5 5 1, and the output's first row is the same. So maybe the first row is unchanged? But looking at the second row of the input: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output for that row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. Hmm, so the 5s are in the same positions, but the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. Wait, maybe it's about replacing 0s with some values based on neighboring cells?\n\nLooking at the second row of the input, the 0s are in columns 0,1,2,5,8,9. The output for those positions is 1,1,1,2,2,2. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the surrounding cells. Let me check the third row of the input. The input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are being replaced with 1s and 2s again. Maybe the 0s are being converted to 1s if they are in certain positions or based on the values around them.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 1, the second row starts with 1s and then 5, then 2s. The third row has 1s, then 5, then 2s. The fourth row is similar. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value in the same column of the previous row? Or maybe based on the value in the same column of the next row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with values that depend on the surrounding cells. For example, in the second row of input, the 0s are in positions 0,1,2,5,8,9. The output for those positions is 1,1,1,2,2,2. Let me check the first row. The first row has 1,5,1,5,5,2,5,5,5,1. So for column 0, the first row is 1, and the second row's column 0 is 1. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value from the row above if it's non-zero? But in the second row's column 0, the input is 0, but the output is 1. The first row's column 0 is 1. So maybe if the cell above is non-zero, then the current cell is set to that value? But then, in the second row's column 5, the input is 0, and the output is 2. The first row's column 5 is 2. So that seems to fit. But what about the third row's column 5? The input is 0, and the output is 2. The first row's column 5 is 2. So maybe that's the pattern: if a cell is 0, replace it with the value from the cell above it, but only if that cell is non-zero?\n\nBut wait, in the second row, column 5 is 0, and the output is 2. The first row's column 5 is 2. So that's consistent. Similarly, the third row's column 5 is 0, and the output is 2. The first row's column 5 is 2. So that seems to be the case. But then, what about the third row's column 0? The input is 0, and the output is 1. The first row's column 0 is 1. So that seems to fit. So maybe for each 0 in the input, the output is the value from the cell above it, but only if that cell is non-zero. But what if the cell above is zero? Then maybe it's replaced with something else?\n\nBut looking at Example 2. Let's check that. For example, in the input of Example 2, the first row is 2 5 5 5 1 5 5 5 5 2. The output's first row is the same. So the first row remains unchanged. Then the second row of input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. So the 0s in the second row are being replaced with 1s, except where there's a 5. For example, column 0: input is 0, output is 1. The cell above (first row's column 0 is 2, which is non-zero. So maybe the 0s are replaced with the value from the cell above if it's non-zero. But in the second row's column 3, the input is 0, and the output is 1. The cell above (first row's column 3 is 5. So that's not matching. Wait, but in that case, maybe the cell above is not the one being used. Maybe it's the cell to the left or right?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, or something like that. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero. Let's check in Example 1's second row. The second row's input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The first three columns are 0s, and the output is 1s. The fourth column is 5. Then column 5 is 0, output is 2. The cell to the left (column 4) is 0, which is not helpful. Hmm. Maybe the value from the cell above?\n\nIn Example 1's second row, column 0 is 0, and the output is 1. The cell above (row 0, column 0) is 1. So maybe the 0s are replaced with the value from the cell above if it's non-zero. Then, for column 5, the cell above is 2. So output is 2. That seems to fit. For column 5 in the second row, the input is 0, output is 2. The cell above is 2. So that's correct.\n\nIn Example 2's second row, the input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. The third column is 5, which is same as input. For the first column (0), the output is 1. The cell above is 2 (first row, column 0). So that fits. For the second column (0), output is 1. The cell above is 5 (first row, column 1). So that's 5, but output is 1. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value from the cell to the left. For example, in the second row of Example 1, the first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing. But the cell to the right is 0. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with the value of the cell to the right. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero. For example, in the second row of Example 1, the first three columns are 0. The first column is 0, and the cell to the left is nothing. But the cell to the right is 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is non-zero. But in Example 2's second row, column 1 is 0. The cell above is 5. So the output is 1. But why 1? Because the cell above is 5, but the output is 1. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero. Let's check in Example 1's second row. The first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing. So maybe not. But the second column is 0. The cell to the left is 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if there's a 5 in the same row or column. For example, in Example 1's second row, the 0s are in positions where there's a 5 in the same row. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the previous row, but if that's zero, then something else. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The previous row (row 0) has 1. So output is 1. For the second row's column 5, the previous row's column 5 is 2. So output is 2. That seems to fit. But in Example 2's second row, column 1 is 0. The previous row's column 1 is 5. So output is 1. But that's not matching. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is non-zero, and 2s if the cell above is 5. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. The 1s are in the first three columns and the last two columns. The 2s are in columns 5 and 8. Wait, the second row of output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. So columns 0-2 are 1, column 3 is 5, columns 4-6 are 2, column 7 is 5, columns 8-9 are 2. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the same column as a 5 in the previous row, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then maybe the cell to the left or right. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at Example 3. Let's see. The input's second row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced with 2s. The third row of input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 5 2 2 2. So again, 0s are replaced with 2s. The first row of input is 1 5 2 5 2 5 5 5 5 1. The output is same as input. So perhaps the 0s are being replaced with 2s if they are in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell to the left or right. For example, in Example 1, the second row's first three columns are 0s. The output is 1s. The cell to the left of the first column is nothing. But the cell to the right is 0. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is non-zero. But in Example 2's second row, the first column is 0, and the cell above is 2 (non-zero), so output is 1. The second column is 0, cell above is 5, output is 1. So that doesn't fit. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero. Let's check Example 1's second row. The first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing. So maybe not. But the second column is 0. The cell to the left is 0. So that's not helpful. The third column is 0. The cell to the left is 0. So that's not helpful. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the right is non-zero. For example, in the second row of Example 1, the first column is 0. The cell to the right is 0. So that's not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 5 is 0. The row below (third row) has 0 in column 5. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if there's a 5 in the same row. For example, in Example 1's second row, the 0s are in positions where there's a 5 in the same row. But the second row of input has 5 in column 3 and 7. The 0s are in columns 0,1,2,5,8,9. So for column 5, the 0 is replaced with 2. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell in the same column of the row above. If that cell is 1, replace with 1. If it's 2, replace with 2. If it's 5, replace with 1 or 2 based on something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that cell is zero, then the value of the cell to the left. But that's getting too complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have 1s and 2s replacing the 0s. In Example 2, the output has 1s and 5s. Wait, in Example 2's output, the second row is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. So the 0s are replaced with 1s. The third row is 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1. So all 0s are replaced with 1s. The fourth row is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. So again, 0s replaced with 1s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first three columns are 0s. The cell to the left of the first column is nothing. But the cell to the left of the second column is 0. So that doesn't fit. But the third column is 0. The cell to the left is 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is non-zero. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first column is 0, and the cell above is 1. So output is 1. The second column is 0, cell above is 5. Output is 1. So that's not matching. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing. So maybe not. But the second column is 0. The cell to the left is 0. So not helpful.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me look for another pattern. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 5 is 0. The row below (third row) is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So column 5 is 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same row, but to the right. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 0 is 0. The cell to the right is 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell in the same row to the left is non-zero. For example, in the second row of Example 1, the first three columns are 0s. The first column's left is nothing. So maybe not. The second column's left is 0. So not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The first three columns are 1s. The next is 5, then 2s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the first three columns, and 2s if they are in other positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation involves some kind of erosion or dilation of the 0s. For example, replacing 0s with 1s or 2s based on the surrounding values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1's second row: the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. The 1s are in positions where the cell above is 1 or 5. The 2s are where the cell above is 2. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if there's a 5 in the same row or column. For example, in the second row of Example 1, there are 5s in column 3 and 7. So the 0s around them are replaced with 1s or 2s. But that's not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the minimum of the surrounding cells. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then the cell in the same column of the row below. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the second row is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the input's second row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 0s are replaced with 2s. The third row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 5 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced with 2s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 2s if the cell above is 2 or 5. But in the second row of Example 3, the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. The cell above (row 0) is 1 5 2 5 2 5 5 5 5 1. So the cell in column 6 is 5. So the 0 in column 6 of row 1 is replaced with 2. So that's not matching. But the cell above is 5. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 2 if the cell above is 5 or 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is non-zero, and 2s if the cell above is 5. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 0 is 0. The cell above is 1 (non-zero), so replaced with 1. Column 5 is 0, cell above is 2, replaced with 2. Column 8 is 0, cell above is 5 (row 0, column 8 is 5), replaced with 5? But in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output of the examples. In Example 1, the output seems to have 1s and 2s replacing the 0s. In Example 2, the output has 1s and 5s. In Example 3, the output has 2s and 5s. So maybe the replacement depends on the surrounding values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 5 is 0. The cell above is 2 (row 0, column 5 is 2). So replaced with 2. That fits. For the third row of Example 1, column 5 is 0. The cell above is 2 (row 2, column 5 is 0?), wait the input for Example 1's third row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the cell above (row 2, column 5 is 0). The cell below (row 3, column 5 is 0). So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if there's a 5 in the same row, and 2s otherwise. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that cell is 0, then the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above if it's non-zero, otherwise 1. But that would explain some cases. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 0 is 0. The cell above is 1, so replaced with 1. Column 5 is 0. The cell above is 2, replaced with 2. Column 8 is 0. The cell above is 5, replaced with 5. But in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output of the examples. For example, in Example 1, the second row of output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The third row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. The fourth row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. So the 0s in the second row are replaced with 1s and 2s. The third row's 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. It seems like there's a spread of values from the 0s, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. But how would that work?\n\nLet me try to think of a possible transformation rule. Suppose that for each cell in the input grid, if it's 0, then replace it with the value from the cell above it. If the cell above is also 0, then replace it with the value from the cell below. But that's just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1's second row, column 0 is 0. The cell above is 1, so replaced with 1. Column 5 is 0. Cell above is 2, replaced with 2. Column 8 is 0. Cell above is 5, replaced with 5. But in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and 1 otherwise. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first three columns are 0. The cell to the left of the first column is nothing, so replaced with 1. The cell to the left of the second column is 0, so replaced with 1. The third column is 0, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. Then the fourth column is 5, so no change. The fifth column is 0. The cell to the left is 5, so replaced with 5? But the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the output of the examples. For instance, in Example 1, the output's second row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The third row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. The fourth row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. So it seems like the 0s are being replaced with 1s and 2s based on the values in the previous rows. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2s if the cell above is 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is non-zero, and 2s if the cell above is 5. But in Example 1's second row, the cell above for column 5 is 2, so replaced with 2. For column 8, the cell above is 5, replaced with 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2s if the cell above is 2 or 5. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first three columns are 0. The cell to the left of the first column is nothing, so replaced with 1. The cell to the left of the second column is 0, replaced with 1. The cell to the left of the third column is 0, replaced with 1. The fourth column is 5. The fifth column is 0. The cell to the right is 0, so replaced with 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. For example, in the second row of Example 1, the first three columns are 0. The cell to the left of the first column is nothing, so replaced with 1. The cell to the left of the second column is 0, so replaced with 1. The cell to the left of the third column is 0, replaced with 1. The fourth column is 5. The fifth column is 0. The cell to the right is 0, so replaced with 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. This seems to fit some examples but not others.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, maybe I should think of another approach. Maybe the transformation involves some kind of erosion or dilation, where 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the surrounding cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if there's a 5 in the same row, and 2s otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s are being replaced with the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then the value of the cell in the same column of the row below. Let's try this with Example 1's second row. For column 0, the cell above is 1 (non-zero), so replaced with 1. Column 5, cell above is 2, replaced with 2. Column 8, cell above is 5 (row 0, column 8 is 5), replaced with 5. But in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as a combination of the input and some transformation based on the neighboring cells. For example, in Example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if there's a 5 in the same column above, and 2s otherwise. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. Let's try this for Example 1's second row. For the first column, cell to the left is nothing, so replaced with 1. Second column, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. Third column, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. Fourth column is 5. Fifth column, cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Sixth column, cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Seventh column, cell to the right is 5, replaced with 2. Eighth column, cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Ninth column, cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Tenth column, cell to the right is nothing, replaced with 2. This would give 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2, which matches the output. So this seems to fit for Example 1's second row.\n\nLet's check this for Example 2's second row. The input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. For the first column, cell to the left is nothing, replaced with 1. Second column, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. Third column is 5. Fourth column, cell to the left is 5, replaced with 1. Fifth column, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. Sixth column, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. Seventh column, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. Eighth column is 5. Ninth column, cell to the left is 5, replaced with 1. Tenth column, cell to the left is 0, replaced with 1. This gives 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1, which matches the output. So this seems to work.\n\nFor Example 3's second row: input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. Output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. Let's apply the rule: for each 0, replace with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, else 2. Wait, but in this case, the first three columns are 0. The cell to the left of the first column is nothing, so replaced with 2? But the output is 2. Let's see:\n\nFirst column: cell to the left is nothing. According to the rule, if the cell to the left is non-zero, replace with 1. Otherwise, maybe replace with 2. So for the first column, replaced with 2. Second column: cell to the left is 0, replaced with 2. Third column: cell to the left is 0, replaced with 2. Fourth column is 5. Fifth column: cell to the left is 5, replaced with 1? But the output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the rule might not be consistent. But in Example 3's second row, the output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. Let's see: for the fifth column, which is 0. The cell to the left is 5 (column 4). So according to the previous rule, replaced with 1. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo maybe the rule is different. Perhaps the 0s are replaced with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2 if the cell to the right is non-zero. Let's try that for Example 3's second row. \n\nFirst column: cell to the left is nothing, replaced with 2. Second column: cell to the left is 0, replaced with 2. Third column: cell to the left is 0, replaced with 2. Fourth column is 5. Fifth column: cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Sixth column: cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Seventh column: cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Eighth column: cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Ninth column: cell to the right is 0, replaced with 2. Tenth column: cell to the right is nothing, replaced with 2. This would give 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2, which matches the output. So this seems to work.\n\nSo the rule is: for each 0 in the input, replace it with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2 if the cell to the right is non-zero. If both are zero, then replace with 2? Or maybe if neither is non-zero, replace with 2.\n\nLet's test this for Example 1's second row. The first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing (so 0), and the cell to the right is 0. So according to this rule, replace with 2? But the output is 1. So this doesn't fit. Wait, but in Example 1's second row, the first three columns are 0, and the output is 1 1 1. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let's try to re-express the rule. Maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if there's a non-zero cell to the left, or 2 if there's a non-zero cell to the right. But if both are zero, then replace with 1 or 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: if the cell to the left is non-zero, replace with 1. Otherwise, if the cell to the right is non-zero, replace with 2. Otherwise, replace with 1 or 2 based on some other condition.\n\nBut this is getting too complex. Let's try to see for Example 1's second row. The first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing, so replaced with 1. The second column is 0. The cell to the left is 0, so check the cell to the right (0), replaced with 1. But the output is 1. So maybe if both are zero, replace with 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, the rule is: if the cell to the left is non-zero, replace with 1. If the cell to the right is non-zero, replace with 2. Otherwise, replace with 1.\n\nBut in Example 1's second row, the first column has cell to the left as nothing, so replaced with 1. The second column has cell to the left as 0, but cell to the right is 0, so replaced with 1. The third column has cell to the left as 0, cell to the right as 5 (column 3 is 5). So replaced with 2. But in the output, the third column is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 0s with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. But in some cases, this might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. If both are zero, then replace with 1.\n\nLet's test this for Example 1's second row:\n\nFirst column: left is nothing, right is 0. So replaced with 1.\n\nSecond column: left is 0, right is 0. So replaced with 1.\n\nThird column: left is 0, right is 5. So replaced with 2. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if there's a 5 in the same row, and 2s otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to implement a rule that replaces 0s with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, otherwise 2. Let's see if that works for the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: left is nothing, replaced with 2. But output is 1. So no.\n\nBut in Example 2's second row, the first column is 0. Left is nothing, replaced with 2. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe the rule is to replace 0s with 1 if the cell above is non-zero, and 2 if the cell below is non-zero. Let's try this for Example 1's second row.\n\nColumn 0: cell above is 1 (non-zero), replaced with 1. Column 5: cell above is 2, replaced with 2. Column 8: cell above is 5, replaced with 5. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of the input and some pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have the same values as the input in certain rows, and for others, it's filled with 1s and 2s. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell in the same column of the row above, but if that's zero, then the value of the cell in the same column of the row below.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe the rule is: for each cell (i,j), if the input is 0, then check the cell above (i-1,j). If that is non-zero, replace with that value. Otherwise, check the cell below (i+1,j). If that is non-zero, replace with that value. Otherwise, replace with 1.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: cell above is 1 \u2192 replace with 1.\n\nColumn 1: cell above is 5 \u2192 replace with 5? But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1 if the cell above is non-zero, and 2 if the cell below is non-zero. For Example 1's second row, column 0: cell above is 1 \u2192 replaced with 1. Column 5: cell above is 2 \u2192 replaced with 2. Column 8: cell above is 5 \u2192 replaced with 5. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too frustrating. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the second row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The third row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. The fourth row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. So it seems like the 0s in the second row are being replaced with 1s and 2s, and the 0s in the third row are being replaced with 1s and 2s. It looks like the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the first three columns, and 2s in other positions.\n\nMaybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s if the cell to the right is non-zero. Let's try this for Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: left is nothing \u2192 replaced with 1. Column 1: left is 0 \u2192 replaced with 2? But the output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2 if the cell to the right is non-zero. For example, in the second row of Example 1, column 0: left is nothing \u2192 replaced with 1. Column 1: left is 0 \u2192 replaced with 2. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see. The most consistent pattern I've seen is that 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell to the left or right. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first three columns are 0, and the output is 1s. The fourth column is 5. The fifth column is 0, replaced with 2. The sixth column is 0, replaced with 2. The seventh column is 0, replaced with 2. The eighth column is 5. The ninth and tenth columns are 0, replaced with 2.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each 0 in the input, if the cell to the left is non-zero, replace with 1. If the cell to the right is non-zero, replace with 2. Otherwise, replace with 1.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: left is nothing \u2192 replaced with 1.\n\nColumn 1: left is 0 \u2192 right is 0 \u2192 replaced with 1.\n\nColumn 2: left is 0 \u2192 right is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. But the output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is not working.\n\nMaybe the rule is to replace 0 with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, else 2. Let's try this for Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: left is nothing \u2192 replaced with 2. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example 2's second row, the first column is 0. Left is nothing \u2192 replaced with 2. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that 0s are replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s otherwise. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it might be the best I can do.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each cell in the grid, if it is 0, replace it with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, else 2. If the cell to the left is zero, then check the cell to the right. If the cell to the right is non-zero, replace with 2. Otherwise, replace with 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's implement this and see.\n\nFor Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: left is nothing \u2192 replaced with 2. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if the cell above is non-zero, else 2. Let's try this for Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: cell above is 1 \u2192 replaced with 1.\n\nColumn 1: cell above is 5 \u2192 replaced with 5. But output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working. Given the time, I'll proceed with the assumption that the 0s are replaced with 1s if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2s otherwise. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if it's 0, check the cell to the left. If it's non-zero, replace with 1. Else, replace with 2.\n\nBut this would replace some 0s with 1 or 2 based on the left cell.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2's second row, the first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing, so replaced with 2. But the output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, and 2 if the cell to the right is non-zero. If both are zero, then replace with 1.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1's second row:\n\nColumn 0: left is nothing, right is 0 \u2192 replaced with 1.\n\nColumn 1: left is 0, right is 0 \u2192 replaced with 1.\n\nColumn 2: left is 0, right is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2.\n\nColumn 5: left is 0, right is 0 \u2192 replaced with 1. But output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible hypothesis based on the examples, even if it's not perfect. The most consistent pattern I've seen is that 0s are replaced with 1s or 2s based on the cell above. For example, in Example 1's second row, the cell above is 1, so replaced with 1. The cell above is 2, replaced with 2. The cell above is 5, replaced with 2. This might suggest that if the cell above is non-zero, replace with 1 if it's 1 or 5, and 2 if it's 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess. So, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i, j), if the input is 0, then replace with the value of the cell above (i-1, j). If that is zero, replace with 1. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, replace 0 with 1 if the cell above is non-zero, and 2 if the cell above is 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell, if it's 0, replace it with 1 if the cell to the left is non-zero, else 2. This might not fit all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nNow, I'll write the code.\n\nThe function will iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, if it's 0, check the left cell. If the left cell is non-zero, replace with 1. Else, replace with 2.\n\nBut this might not work for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check left cell\n                if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] != 0:\n                    row.append(1)\n                else:\n                    row.append(2)\n            else:\n                row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this might not work for all examples. For example, in Example 1's second row, the first three columns are 0, and the left cell is 0, so replaced with 2. But the output is 1. So this code would not work for that.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, even if it's not perfect. It's possible that the actual pattern is more complex, but this is the best I can do based on the examples.\n"
