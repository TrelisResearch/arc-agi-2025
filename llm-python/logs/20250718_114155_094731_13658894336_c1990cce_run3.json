              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation involves:\n1. Expanding the grid by adding new rows and columns\n2. Filling in new cells with values based on neighboring cells\n3. Creating patterns that resemble a spiral or wave-like pattern\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that expands the grid and fills in new cells based on neighboring values.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 13x13 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid to the center of the output grid\n    for i in range(7):\n        for j in range(7):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill in the remaining cells based on neighboring values\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if i < 7 or j < 7:\n                # If we're in the original 7x7 area, leave it as is\n                continue\n            # For the outer ring, fill based on neighboring values\n            if i == 7 or i == 12 or j == 7 or j == 12:\n                # If we're on the edge, fill based on the value from the center\n                if i == 7 and j == 7:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[0][0]\n                elif i == 7 and j == 12:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[0][6]\n                elif i == 12 and j == 7:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[6][0]\n                elif i == 12 and j == 12:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[6][6]\n                else:\n                    # For other edge positions, fill based on the value from the center\n                    if i == 7:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[0][j-7]\n                    elif j == 7:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i-7][0]\n                    elif i == 12:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[6][j-7]\n                    elif j == 12:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i-7][6]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
