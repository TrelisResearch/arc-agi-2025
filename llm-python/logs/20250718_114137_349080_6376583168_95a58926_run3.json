          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid appears to be a transformation of the input grid where certain values are replaced or modified based on their position and value.\n2. There seems to be a pattern where certain values (like 5) are replaced with 2 in some rows, and other values (like 1) are replaced with 0 or other values.\n3. The output grid has a consistent structure where certain positions are filled with specific values, and others are left as 0.\n4. There appears to be a pattern where values in certain columns are modified based on their row position.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values with others based on their position\n- Maintaining a consistent structure in the output grid\n- Applying a transformation that changes values in specific patterns\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Apply transformation based on observed patterns\n    for row in range(19):\n        for col in range(13):\n            # Example pattern: replace 5 with 2 in certain rows\n            if row in [4, 9, 14, 19] and grid[row][col] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            # Example pattern: replace 1 with 0 in certain columns\n            if col in [7, 12] and grid[row][col] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            # Example pattern: replace 0 with 5 in certain positions\n            if grid[row][col] == 0 and (row % 2 == 0 or col % 2 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Apply transformation based on observed patterns\n    for row in range(19):\n        for col in range(13):\n            # Example pattern: replace 5 with 2 in certain rows\n            if row in [4, 9, 14, 19] and grid[row][col] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            # Example pattern: replace 1 with 0 in certain columns\n            if col in [7, 12] and grid[row][col] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            # Example pattern: replace 0 with 5 in certain positions\n            if grid[row][col] == 0 and (row % 2 == 0 or col % 2 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid appears to be a transformation of the input grid where certain values are replaced or modified based on their position and value.\n2. There seems to be a pattern where certain values (like 5) are replaced with 2 in some rows, and other values (like 1) are replaced with 0 or other values.\n3. The output grid has a consistent structure where certain positions are filled with specific values, and others are left as 0.\n4. There appears to be a pattern where values in certain columns are modified based on their row position.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values with others based on their position\n- Maintaining a consistent structure in the output grid\n- Applying a transformation that changes values in specific patterns\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Apply transformation based on observed patterns\n    for row in range(19):\n        for col in range(13):\n            # Example pattern: replace 5 with 2 in certain rows\n            if row in [4, 9, 14, 19] and grid[row][col] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            # Example pattern: replace 1 with 0 in certain columns\n            if col in [7, 12] and grid[row][col] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            # Example pattern: replace 0 with 5 in certain positions\n            if grid[row][col] == 0 and (row % 2 == 0 or col % 2 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Apply transformation based on observed patterns\n    for row in range(19):\n        for col in range(13):\n            # Example pattern: replace 5 with 2 in certain rows\n            if row in [4, 9, 14, 19] and grid[row][col] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            # Example pattern: replace 1 with 0 in certain columns\n            if col in [7, 12] and grid[row][col] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            # Example pattern: replace 0 with 5 in certain positions\n            if grid[row][col] == 0 and (row % 2 == 0 or col % 2 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
