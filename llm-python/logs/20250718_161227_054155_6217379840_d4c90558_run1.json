The output grid is always 3x8\n2. The output seems to be formed by extracting certain regions or patterns from the input grid\n3. There's a pattern of extracting horizontal lines or regions that have specific values (like 8s or 7s)\n4. The output seems to be formed by taking specific rows or columns from the input grid\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that extracts certain rows or columns from the input grid to form the output.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Extract specific rows from the input grid to form the output\n    # Based on the patterns observed in the training examples\n    transformed_grid = [\n        [grid[0][col] for col in range(8)],\n        [grid[1][col] for col in range(8)],\n        [grid[2][col] for col in range(8)]\n    ]\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
