          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others, particularly 8s being replaced with 4s or 8s being replaced with 4s in certain positions.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where 8s in certain positions are replaced with 4s, but this is not uniform across all positions.\n3. The transformation also involves some kind of pattern recognition, where certain shapes or configurations of numbers are transformed in specific ways.\n4. There are also instances where 6s are left unchanged, suggesting that the transformation is not simply a direct substitution.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their position and value, with some patterns being more prominent than others.\n\nHere is my implementation of the transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(19):\n            # Replace 8 with 4 in certain positions\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # This is a simplified pattern based on observations\n                # More complex patterns would require more detailed analysis\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            # Leave 6 unchanged\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                continue\n            # Leave 0 unchanged\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0:\n                continue\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(19):\n            # Replace 8 with 4 in certain positions\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # This is a simplified pattern based on observations\n                # More complex patterns would require more detailed analysis\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            # Leave 6 unchanged\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                continue\n            # Leave 0 unchanged\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0:\n                continue\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others, particularly 8s being replaced with 4s or 8s being replaced with 4s in certain positions.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where 8s in certain positions are replaced with 4s, but this is not uniform across all positions.\n3. The transformation also involves some kind of pattern recognition, where certain shapes or configurations of numbers are transformed in specific ways.\n4. There are also instances where 6s are left unchanged, suggesting that the transformation is not simply a direct substitution.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their position and value, with some patterns being more prominent than others.\n\nHere is my implementation of the transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(19):\n            # Replace 8 with 4 in certain positions\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # This is a simplified pattern based on observations\n                # More complex patterns would require more detailed analysis\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            # Leave 6 unchanged\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                continue\n            # Leave 0 unchanged\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0:\n                continue\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(19):\n            # Replace 8 with 4 in certain positions\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # This is a simplified pattern based on observations\n                # More complex patterns would require more detailed analysis\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            # Leave 6 unchanged\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                continue\n            # Leave 0 unchanged\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0:\n                continue\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
