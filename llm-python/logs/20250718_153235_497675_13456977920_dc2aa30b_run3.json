          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some rows with 0s in the middle, like the fourth row is all zeros. The output for that row is also all zeros. So maybe those rows are left unchanged? But looking at other rows, like the first input row is 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 0 1 2 1. The output for that row is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. Hmm, so the first row of input becomes the first row of output. But the second row of input is 1 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 1 2, and the output is 1 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 1 1. So some changes here. Let me check the third row of input: 2 2 2 0 1 2 2 0 2 1 2. Output is 1 2 1 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 1. So the first element changes from 2 to 1, and the third element from 2 to 1. \n\nLooking at the outputs, there's a pattern where certain positions are changed. Maybe it's about replacing some values with others based on their position? Or maybe there's a transformation that involves flipping or rotating parts of the grid. Alternatively, maybe it's about some kind of logical operation between adjacent cells.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in all examples, the middle row (row 4) and the middle row (row 8?) are all zeros in both input and output. So maybe those rows are not changed. But in the input, the fourth row is all zeros, and the output is also all zeros. Similarly for the eighth row. So maybe those rows are left as is.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first row of output is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. The input first row is 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 0 1 2 1. So the first element is 2, which is same as input. The second element is 2 in input, but 1 in output. The third element is 1 in input, same as output. Then the fourth is 0, same. Then fifth is 2 in input, but 1 in output. Sixth is 2 in input, 1 in output. Seventh is 2 in input, 1 in output. Eighth is 0. Then ninth is 1, same. Tenth is 2 in input, 1 in output. Eleventh is 1, same. So there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed. Maybe the second, fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth elements are being modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a transformation that involves looking at the positions in a certain way. For example, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values based on their position relative to the center of the grid. Since the grid is 11x11, the center is at position (5,5) if we start counting from 0. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the first row's output seems to have some changes. Let me think about the positions. For example, in the first row of input, the first element is 2. In the output, it's 2. Then the second element is 2 in input, but 1 in output. The third is 1, same. The fourth is 0. Then fifth is 2 in input, 1 in output. Sixth is 2 in input, 1 in output. Seventh is 2 in input, 1 in output. Then eighth is 0. Then ninth is 1, same. Tenth is 2 in input, 1 in output. Eleventh is 1, same. So the second, fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth elements are changed from 2 to 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their distance from the center. Let's think of the grid as 11x11. The center is at (5,5). For each cell, maybe some transformation is applied based on their position relative to the center. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by applying a certain rule to each cell. For example, if the cell is in a certain position, like in the first row, maybe the second element is changed. But this seems too vague.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. Let's take the first row of input: 1 1 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 1 1. The output is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. So the first element is 1 in input, 2 in output. The second is 1 in input, 1 in output. Third is 2 in input, 1 in output. Fourth is 0. Fifth is 2 in input, 1 in output. Sixth is 1 in input, 1 in output. Seventh is 2 in input, 1 in output. Eighth is 0. Ninth is 2 in input, 1 in output. Tenth is 1 in input, 1 in output. Eleventh is 1 in input, 1 in output. So the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth elements are changed from 1 or 2 to 1 or 2. Wait, the first element is 1 in input and becomes 2. The third is 2 in input and becomes 1. The fifth is 2 in input and becomes 1. The seventh is 2 in input and becomes 1. The ninth is 2 in input and becomes 1. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their position in the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first row of example 1's output, the second element is 1. In example 2's first row, the first element is 2. Maybe the transformation is more complex.\n\nAnother approach: looking for symmetry. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have some symmetry. For instance, the first row of output is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. The first element is 2, the second is 1, third is 1, then 0, then 1s. The second row of output is 1 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 1 1. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are mirrored or transformed in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values based on their position. For example, in the first row of example 1's input, the first element is 2. In the output, it's 2. The second element is 2, but in output it's 1. The third is 1, same. Fourth is 0. Then fifth is 2, but in output it's 1. Sixth is 2, output is 1. Seventh is 2, output is 1. Then eighth is 0. Ninth is 1, same. Tenth is 2, output is 1. Eleventh is 1, same. So the second, fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth elements are changed. Maybe these positions are in the first row, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position in the grid. For example, in the first row, the second element is changed from 2 to 1. The fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth elements are changed. Maybe these are positions that are in certain columns. Let's think about the columns. The first row of input is 11 elements. Let's index them from 0 to 10.\n\nIn example 1's first row, the positions that change are 1, 4, 5, 6, 9. Let's see: 1 is the second column, 4 is fifth, 5 is sixth, 6 is seventh, 9 is tenth. Wait, maybe these are columns that are symmetric around the center. The center is at column 5 (since 11 columns, 0-10). So column 5 is the middle. Columns 1 and 9 are symmetric (since 1 + 9 = 10, which is 10). Similarly, 4 and 6 (4+6=10). Wait, 4+6 is 10, which is the total columns minus 1. So maybe for each row, the positions that are symmetric to the center are being modified. For example, in the first row, columns 1 and 9 are symmetric (since 1 and 9 are mirrored around 5). Similarly, columns 4 and 6 are mirrored. Column 5 is the center. So maybe for each row, certain positions are being modified based on their symmetry.\n\nLooking at example 1's first row output: the second element (column 1) is 1, and the tenth element (column 9) is 1. In the input, column 1 was 2 and column 9 was 2. So they are changed to 1. Similarly, column 4 (fifth element) was 2, and column 6 (seventh element) was 2, and they are changed to 1. Column 5 (seventh element?) Wait, the fifth element in the first row is column 4 (since indexes start at 0). Wait, maybe the positions that are mirrored around the center are being modified. For example, in the first row, the positions that are mirrored around column 5 (the center) are:\n\nFor column i, the mirror is 10 - i. Because 0 and 10 are mirrored, 1 and 9, 2 and 8, 3 and 7, 4 and 6, 5 is the center.\n\nSo for each row, maybe the values at positions i and 10 - i are being modified. For example, in the first row of example 1, the input is:\n\nOriginal values for columns 0-10: [2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\nIn the output, the first row is [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1].\n\nLooking at column 0: 2 remains 2. Column 1 (original 2) becomes 1. Column 2 (original 1) remains 1. Column 3 (original 0) remains 0. Column 4 (original 2) becomes 1. Column 5 (original 2) becomes 1. Column 6 (original 2) becomes 1. Column 7 (original 0) remains 0. Column 8 (original 1) remains 1. Column 9 (original 2) becomes 1. Column 10 (original 1) remains 1.\n\nSo for columns 1 and 9 (mirror positions), they are changed from 2 to 1. For columns 4 and 6 (mirror positions), they are changed from 2 to 1. Column 5 (the center) is changed from 2 to 1. Wait, but column 5 is the center. So maybe for each row, the values at positions that are mirrored around the center are being modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row, the values in columns that are not the center are being modified. For example, in the first row of example 1, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are modified. But why?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's first row, the values at positions 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are changed. Maybe these positions are part of a certain pattern. For example, maybe the center column (column 5) is being changed. Also, columns that are symmetric to the center. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, then apply a transformation. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2's first row input: 1 1 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 1 1. The output is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. So the first element is 1 in input, becomes 2. The third element is 2, becomes 1. The fifth is 2, becomes 1. The seventh is 2, becomes 1. The ninth is 2, becomes 1. So again, the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth elements are modified. But in this case, the first element is changed to 2, while in example 1's first row, the first element is unchanged. So this suggests that the pattern isn't consistent across all rows. Hmm.\n\nWait, in example 2's first row, the first element is changed. But in example 1's first row, the first element is not changed. So maybe the transformation is not uniform across all rows. That complicates things.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the first row is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. The second row is 1 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 1 1. The third row is 1 2 1 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 1. The fourth row is all zeros. The fifth row is 2 2 1 0 2 1 2 0 1 2 1. The sixth row is 1 2 2 0 1 2 1 0 1 1 2. The seventh row is 2 1 2 0 2 2 1 0 2 1 2. The eighth row is all zeros. The ninth row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 1. The tenth row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 2 2. The eleventh row is 2 2 2 0 1 2 2 0 2 2 2.\n\nLooking at the output, the first three rows seem to have some pattern. For example, the first row has 2, then 1s, then 0, then 1s. The second row starts with 1, then 2, then 1, then 0, then 2, then 1s. The third row starts with 1, 2, 1, then 0, then 1, 1, 2, 0, then 1, 2, 1. It's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves replacing certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's modified. But how?\n\nLooking at the first row of example 1's input and output, the first row of the output has 2 in the first position, then 1s, then 0, then 1s. The second row of the output starts with 1, then 2, then 1, then 0, then 2, then 1s. The third row starts with 1, 2, 1, then 0, then 1, 1, 2, then 0, then 1, 2, 1. It seems like the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their row and column.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for example 1's first row. The first element is 2, which is the same as input. The second element is 1. The third is 1. The fourth is 0. The fifth is 1. The sixth is 1. The seventh is 1. The eighth is 0. The ninth is 1. The tenth is 1. The eleventh is 1. So the first row of output has a pattern where the first element is 2, then 1s, then 0, then 1s. Maybe this is a pattern where the first row is transformed by replacing certain values based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position relative to the center. For example, if a cell is in the first row, then the second column is changed to 1. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by applying a certain rule to each cell. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, then it's modified. For example, in example 1's first row, the second column (position 1) is changed to 1. The fifth column (position 4) is changed to 1. The sixth (position 5) is changed to 1. The seventh (position 6) is changed to 1. The tenth (position 9) is changed to 1. But how to determine which positions to change?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1's first row, the values are 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1. So the pattern is 2 followed by 1, 1, 0, then 1, 1, 1, 0, then 1, 1, 1. So maybe the first row is transformed by replacing certain values based on their column. For example, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are being modified. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing the values in certain positions based on their row. For example, in the first row, the second column is changed. In the second row, the second column is 2 in input, but becomes 1 in output. Wait, in example 1's second row input is 1 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 1 2. The output is 1 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 1 1. So the third column (index 2) is changed from 2 to 1. The fifth column (index 4) is 2 in input, changed to 2 in output? Wait, no. Wait the input for the second row is 1 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 1 2. The output for the second row is 1 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 1 1. So the third column (index 2) is changed from 2 to 1. The sixth column (index 5) is 2 in input, changed to 1 in output. The seventh column (index 6) is 2 in input, changed to 1 in output. The tenth column (index 9) is 1 in input, changed to 1. So maybe in this row, columns 2, 5, 6 are modified.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern where, for each row, certain columns are modified based on their position relative to the center. For example, in the first row, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are modified. In the second row, columns 2, 5, 6 are modified. In the third row, columns 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 are modified. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values in the grid based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the first row, then certain columns are modified. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's first row, the second column is changed from 2 to 1. The fifth column is changed from 2 to 1. The sixth column is changed from 2 to 1. The seventh column is changed from 2 to 1. The tenth column is changed from 2 to 1. These are columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9. These columns are symmetric around the center. For example, column 1 and 9 are symmetric. Column 4 and 6 are symmetric. Column 5 is the center. So maybe for each row, the values at symmetric columns are being modified. For example, in the first row, the values at columns 1 and 9 are changed. Columns 4 and 6 are changed. Column 5 is changed. \n\nSo the transformation could be: for each row, for each column i, if i is not the center column (5), then check if i and 10 - i are symmetric. If so, replace the values at those positions with a certain value. But how?\n\nIn example 1's first row, the values at columns 1 and 9 are both 2 in input and become 1 in output. Similarly, columns 4 and 6 are 2 in input and become 1. Column 5 is 2 and becomes 1. So maybe the rule is: for each row, for each column i, if i is not the center column, then if i is in the first half of the row, replace the value at i and its mirror with 1. But how to determine which values to replace?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace the values at symmetric positions with 1, but only if the original value is 2. But this is just a hypothesis. Let's test it against example 1's first row.\n\nIn example 1's first row, columns 1 and 9 are both 2. So they are replaced with 1. Columns 4 and 6 are 2, replaced with 1. Column 5 is 2, replaced with 1. So that would explain the first row's output. Similarly, in example 2's first row, the input is 1 1 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 1 1. The output is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. So for the first row, columns 0 (value 1) is changed to 2. Column 2 (value 2) is changed to 1. Column 4 (value 2) is changed to 1. Column 6 (value 2) is changed to 1. Column 8 (value 2) is changed to 1. So this seems to fit the pattern where symmetric columns are modified. But why is column 0 changed to 2? Because it's the first column, which is mirrored with column 10. In the first row of example 2, column 0 is 1, and column 10 is 1. In the output, column 0 is 2, and column 10 is 1. Wait, that doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, then it's modified. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the pattern in the output of example 1's first row. The output for the first row is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. The input for the first row is 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 0 1 2 1. The output seems to have the first element as 2, then 1s, then 0, then 1s. The second element is 1, the third is 1, the fourth is 0, the fifth is 1, sixth is 1, seventh is 1, eighth is 0, ninth is 1, tenth is 1, eleventh is 1. So the pattern is that the first element is unchanged, then columns 1-3 are 1, 1, 0, then columns 4-7 are 1, 1, 1, 0, then columns 8-11 are 1, 1, 1. \n\nThis seems like a pattern where the first element is kept, then the next elements are modified to 1, 1, 0, and so on. But how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first row of example 1, the second element is changed from 2 to 1. The fifth element is changed from 2 to 1. The sixth is 2 to 1. The seventh is 2 to 1. The tenth is 2 to 1. So maybe these are positions that are in certain rows or columns. For example, in the first row, the second, fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth columns are being modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where the output is generated by replacing certain values with 1 if they are in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's first row, the values at columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are changed to 1. These columns are symmetric around the center. For example, column 1 and 9 are symmetric, column 4 and 6 are symmetric, and column 5 is the center. So maybe the transformation is to replace the values at symmetric columns with 1. But why would that be the case?\n\nLet's check example 2's first row. The input is 1 1 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 1 1. The output is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. The columns that are symmetric are:\n\n- column 0 and 10: 1 and 1 \u2192 output is 2 and 1. So column 0 is changed to 2, column 10 remains 1. That doesn't fit the previous pattern. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their row. For example, in example 1's first row, the first row is transformed by replacing certain columns with 1. In example 2's first row, the first row is transformed by replacing certain columns with 1 and 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting quite challenging. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's look at the outputs for example 1's rows.\n\nIn example 1, the first three rows of output are:\n\nRow 1: 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n\nRow 2: 1 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 1 1\n\nRow 3: 1 2 1 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 1\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 2 2 1 0 2 1 2 0 1 2 1\n\nRow 6: 1 2 2 0 1 2 1 0 1 1 2\n\nRow 7: 2 1 2 0 2 2 1 0 2 1 2\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 1\n\nRow 10: 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 2 2\n\nRow 11: 2 2 2 0 1 2 2 0 2 2 2\n\nLooking at these rows, there's a pattern where certain columns are modified. For example, in row 1, the second column is 1, third is 1, fourth is 0, fifth is 1, sixth is 1, seventh is 1, eighth is 0, ninth is 1, tenth is 1, eleventh is 1. \n\nIn row 2, the second column is 2, third is 1, fourth is 0, fifth is 2, sixth is 1, seventh is 1, eighth is 0, ninth is 1, tenth is 1, eleventh is 1. \n\nRow 3: second is 1, third is 2, fourth is 0, fifth is 1, sixth is 1, seventh is 2, eighth is 0, ninth is 1, tenth is 2, eleventh is 1.\n\nHmm. It's not clear. Maybe the pattern is that for each row, the values in certain columns are being modified based on their position. For example, in row 1, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are modified. In row 2, columns 2, 5, 6 are modified. In row 3, columns 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 are modified.\n\nThis seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern based on the row number. For example, row 1: modify columns 1,4,5,6,9. Row 2: columns 2,5,6. Row 3: columns 2,5,6,7,9. \n\nBut how to generalize this? It's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's first three rows, the middle columns (columns 4, 5, 6) are modified. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values based on their position in the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first row, the second column is changed to 1, and in the second row, the second column is 2, but in the output it's 2. Wait, no. In the second row of example 1's input, the second column is 2, and in the output it's 2. So this suggests that the transformation is not simply replacing certain columns with 1.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. Let's consider the test input and see what the output might be. But since I can't look at the test output, I need to focus on the training examples.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the middle rows (rows 4 and 8) are all zeros in both input and output. So those rows are unchanged. So perhaps the transformation is to leave those rows as is, and modify other rows based on some pattern.\n\nLooking at the other rows, perhaps the transformation involves modifying certain columns based on their position. For example, in rows 1-3 and 5-11, certain columns are modified.\n\nAnother idea: looking for patterns in the output of example 1's rows. For example, in the first three rows, the middle of the row (column 5) is 1 in the output. In the first row, column 5 is 1. In the second row, column 5 is 1. In the third row, column 5 is 1. In the fifth row, column 5 is 1. In the sixth row, column 5 is 2. In the seventh row, column 5 is 2. In the ninth row, column 5 is 2. In the tenth row, column 5 is 2. In the eleventh row, column 5 is 2. So this suggests that column 5 is modified in some rows but not others. This is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing values based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is in a certain range.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the pattern in the output of example 1's first row. The output for row 1 is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. The input is 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 0 1 2 1. The output seems to have a pattern where certain columns are replaced with 1, and others are kept. For example, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are replaced with 1. But why?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns that are not the center column are replaced with 1 if they are in certain positions. For example, in row 1, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are replaced with 1. In row 2, columns 2, 5, 6 are replaced with 1. In row 3, columns 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 are replaced with 1. This seems like a pattern where for each row, certain columns are replaced with 1 based on their position.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to replace? Maybe the columns that are in certain positions relative to the center. For example, in row 1, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are replaced. These are columns that are in the first half and second half of the row. For example, columns 1 and 9 are symmetric, columns 4 and 6 are symmetric, and column 5 is the center. So perhaps for each row, the columns that are symmetric around the center are replaced with 1, and the center column is also replaced.\n\nBut in example 2's first row, the input is 1 1 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 1 1. The output is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. So for this row, the first column (0) is changed to 2, and the tenth column (9) is 1. This doesn't fit the pattern. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on the input value. For example, if the input value is 2, replace it with 1. But in example 1's first row, some columns are 2 and are replaced with 1, but others are not. For example, in the first row, column 2 is 1, and it's not replaced. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the first row has 2 in the first column, then 1s, then 0, then 1s. This resembles a pattern where the first column is kept as is, but other columns are modified. But this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. Maybe I should try to think of a possible transformation that fits the examples. For example, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values in the grid based on their position in the grid. For example, for each cell (i, j), if j is in certain columns, replace it with 1. Or maybe it's based on the row and column indices.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's first row. The first element is 2, which is the same as input. The second element is 1. The third is 1. The fourth is 0. The fifth is 1. The sixth is 1. The seventh is 1. The eighth is 0. The ninth is 1. The tenth is 1. The eleventh is 1. So the pattern is that the first element is kept, then columns 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 are replaced with 1 or 0. This is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace the values in certain positions based on the row. For example, in rows 1-3, certain columns are replaced with 1, and in other rows, different columns are replaced.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to find a transformation that fits the examples. Let's think about the following hypothesis: for each row, replace the values at columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 with 1, and leave the rest as is. But this is just a guess.\n\nFor example, in example 1's first row, the columns 1,4,5,6,9 are replaced with 1. In example 2's first row, the columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 are replaced with 1 or 2. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, if the column is in the first half of the grid, replace it with 1. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother possible approach: looking at the outputs of the examples, the output for example 1's first row has a pattern where the first element is 2, then 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1. This resembles a pattern where the first element is kept, then the next elements are 1, 1, 0, then 1, 1, 1, 0, then 1, 1, 1. This could be a pattern where the middle of the row is replaced with 0, and the rest are 1. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to write a function that replaces certain values based on their position. For example, for each row, replace the values at columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 with 1, and leave the rest as is. Let's see if this works for example 1's first row.\n\nIn example 1's first row, input is [2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1]. Replacing columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 with 1 would give [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], which matches the output. For example 2's first row input [1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1], replacing columns 1,4,5,6,9 with 1 would give [1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. But the output for example 2's first row is [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. So the first element is 2 in the output, but according to this hypothesis, it would be 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 2's first row, the first element is 1 in input, and in the output it's 2. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain columns based on their position. For example, in row 1, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are replaced with 1. In row 2, columns 2, 5, 6 are replaced with 1. In row 3, columns 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 are replaced with 1. This seems like a pattern where for each row, the columns that are symmetric around the center are replaced with 1, but the exact columns vary.\n\nBut how to generalize this? It seems like for each row, the columns that are symmetric around the center are replaced with 1. For example, for row 1, columns 1 and 9 are symmetric, columns 4 and 6 are symmetric, and column 5 is the center. So replace those with 1. For row 2, columns 2 and 8 are symmetric, columns 5 and 5 (same column), and column 6 and 4? Not sure. This is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I think I need to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace the values at symmetric positions around the center with 1, and leave others as is. For example, for each row, for each column i, if i is not the center, then if i and 10 - i are symmetric, replace both with 1. But this might not fit all examples.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis for example 1's first row. Columns 1 and 9 are symmetric, so replace both with 1. Columns 4 and 6 are symmetric, replace both with 1. Column 5 is the center, replace with 1. This would give the first row of example 1's output. For example 2's first row, columns 0 and 10 are symmetric, so replace both with 1. But in the output, column 0 is 2 and column 10 is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace the values at symmetric positions with 1 if the original value is 2. For example, in example 1's first row, columns 1 and 9 are 2, so replaced with 1. Columns 4 and 6 are 2, replaced with 1. Column 5 is 2, replaced with 1. This would fit. For example 2's first row, columns 0 is 1, so not replaced. Column 2 is 2, replaced with 1. Column 4 is 2, replaced with 1. Column 6 is 2, replaced with 1. Column 8 is 2, replaced with 1. So the output would be [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. But the actual output is [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. So this suggests that column 0 is replaced with 2, which doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the values at symmetric columns are replaced with 1, and the center column is replaced with 1. This seems to fit example 1's first row, and perhaps other rows.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n    for each column i in 0-10:\n        if i is not the center (5):\n            j = 10 - i\n            if i < j:\n                if the original value at i is 2, replace with 1\n                if the original value at j is 2, replace with 1\n        else:\n            if original value is 2, replace with 1\n\nBut this might not work for all examples, but it's a possible approach.\n\nLet's test this for example 1's first row:\n\nOriginal values: [2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\nFor i=0, j=10: i=0 is not center. i < j (0 < 10). Original values at 0 is 2, replace with 1. j=10 is 1, no change. So after this, the values at 0 and 10 are 1 and 1.\n\nWait, but in the output, the first element is 2. So this suggests that this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace the values at symmetric positions with 1 only if the original value is 2. For example, in example 1's first row, the values at columns 1 and 9 are 2, so replaced with 1. Columns 4 and 6 are 2, replaced with 1. Column 5 is 2, replaced with 1. So the first row becomes [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], which matches the output. For example 2's first row, the input is [1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1]. The columns that are symmetric are 0 and 10, 1 and 9, 2 and 8, 3 and 7, 4 and 6. For each of these pairs, if the original value is 2, replace with 1. So for column 2 (value 2), replace with 1. Column 8 (value 2), replace with 1. Column 4 (value 2), replace with 1. Column 6 (value 1), no change. Column 0 (value 1), no change. Column 10 (value 1), no change. Column 1 (value 1), no change. Column 9 (value 1), no change. Column 3 (value 0), no change. Column 7 (value 0), no change. So the output would be [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. But the actual output for example 2's first row is [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. So the first element is 2, but according to this hypothesis, it would be 1. This suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in the actual output, the first element is 2. So why is that? Maybe the first element is not replaced, but the second element is replaced. This suggests that the transformation is not symmetric for all columns, but only for certain ones.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible hypothesis based on the examples I can see, even if it's not perfect. Let's assume that the transformation is to replace certain values in symmetric columns with 1, and leave others as is. For example, for each row, replace the values at columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 with 1, and leave others as is. This would fit example 1's first row.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n    new_row = list of values\n    for i in range(11):\n        if i in [1,4,5,6,9]:\n            new_row[i] = 1\n    return new_row\n\nBut this would not fit example 2's first row, where the first element is changed to 2. But perhaps this is a partial solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values based on their row. For example, in rows 1-3, replace certain columns with 1, in rows 5-11, replace other columns. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the values at columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are replaced with 1. This would fit example 1's first row. Let's see what happens to example 2's first row. The input for example 2's first row is [1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1]. Replacing columns 1,4,5,6,9 with 1 would give [1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. But the actual output for example 2's first row is [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. So the first element is 2, but according to this hypothesis, it would be 1. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the transformation is to replace certain columns based on their row. For example, in row 1, replace columns 1,4,5,6,9 with 1. In row 2, replace columns 2,5,6 with 1. In row 3, replace columns 2,5,6,7,9 with 1. In row 5, replace columns 1,4,5,6,9 with 1. This would be a possible pattern, but how to implement it?\n\nThis seems too complex, but maybe the transformation is to replace the values in certain columns based on the row number. For example, for row i, replace columns (i % 5) or something like that. But this is just guessing.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace certain columns with 1 based on their position, and implement a function that for each row, replaces certain columns with 1. For example, in the first three rows, replace columns 1,4,5,6,9 with 1. In the fifth row, replace columns 1,4,5,6,9 with 1. This might not fit all examples, but it's a possible approach.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = list(row)\n        # Replace certain columns with 1\n        # For example, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9\n        for col in [1, 4, 5, 6, 9]:\n            new_row[col] = 1\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle the other rows correctly. For example, in example 1's second row, the input is [1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2]. Replacing columns 1,4,5,6,9 with 1 would give [1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2]. But the actual output for the second row is [1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Maybe the transformation is to replace the values in the grid based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, replace it with 1. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's first row, the values at columns 1,4,5,6,9 are 1. These columns are symmetric around the center. So for each row, the values at symmetric columns are replaced with 1. For example, for each row, for each column i, if i is not the center, then replace the value at i and 10 - i with 1 if the original value is 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this for example 1's first row. Columns 1 and 9 are 2, so replaced with 1. Columns 4 and 6 are 2, replaced with 1. Column 5 is 2, replaced with 1. This gives the correct output. For example 2's first row, the input is [1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1]. For columns 0 and 10: 1 and 1, no change. Columns 1 and 9: 1 and 1, no change. Columns 2 and 8: 2 and 2, replaced with 1. Columns 3 and 7: 0 and 0, no change. Columns 4 and 6: 2 and 1, replaced with 1. So the new row would be [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. But the actual output for example 2's first row is [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. So the first element is 2, but according to this hypothesis, it would be 1. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in the actual output, the first element is 2. So why is that? Maybe the first element is not replaced, but the second element is replaced. This suggests that the transformation is not symmetric for all columns, but only for certain ones.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the values at columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are replaced with 1. This fits example 1's first row, but not example 2's first row. However, it's possible that the transformation is more complex, and this is a partial solution.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = list(row)\n        for col in [1, 4, 5, 6, 9]:\n            new_row[col] = 1\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle all cases correctly. However, given the time constraints and the lack of a clear pattern, this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some rows with 0s in the middle, like the fourth row is all zeros. The output for that row is also all zeros. So maybe those rows are left unchanged? But looking at other rows, like the first input row is 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 0 1 2 1. The output for that row is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. Hmm, so the first row of input becomes the first row of output. But the second row of input is 1 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 1 2, and the output is 1 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 1 1. So some changes here. Let me check the third row of input: 2 2 2 0 1 2 2 0 2 1 2. Output is 1 2 1 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 1. So the first element changes from 2 to 1, and the third element from 2 to 1. \n\nLooking at the outputs, there's a pattern where certain positions are changed. Maybe it's about replacing some values with others based on their position? Or maybe there's a transformation that involves flipping or rotating parts of the grid. Alternatively, maybe it's about some kind of logical operation between adjacent cells.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in all examples, the middle row (row 4) and the middle row (row 8?) are all zeros in both input and output. So maybe those rows are not changed. But in the input, the fourth row is all zeros, and the output is also all zeros. Similarly for the eighth row. So maybe those rows are left as is.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first row of output is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. The input first row is 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 0 1 2 1. So the first element is 2, which is same as input. The second element is 2 in input, but 1 in output. The third element is 1 in input, same as output. Then the fourth is 0, same. Then fifth is 2 in input, but 1 in output. Sixth is 2 in input, 1 in output. Seventh is 2 in input, 1 in output. Eighth is 0. Then ninth is 1, same. Tenth is 2 in input, 1 in output. Eleventh is 1, same. So there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed. Maybe the second, fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth elements are being modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a transformation that involves looking at the positions in a certain way. For example, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values based on their position relative to the center of the grid. Since the grid is 11x11, the center is at position (5,5) if we start counting from 0. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the first row's output seems to have some changes. Let me think about the positions. For example, in the first row of input, the first element is 2. In the output, it's 2. Then the second element is 2 in input, but 1 in output. The third is 1, same. The fourth is 0. Then fifth is 2 in input, 1 in output. Sixth is 2 in input, 1 in output. Seventh is 2 in input, 1 in output. Then eighth is 0. Then ninth is 1, same. Tenth is 2 in input, 1 in output. Eleventh is 1, same. So the second, fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth elements are changed from 2 to 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their distance from the center. Let's think of the grid as 11x11. The center is at (5,5). For each cell, maybe some transformation is applied based on their position relative to the center. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by applying a certain rule to each cell. For example, if the cell is in a certain position, like in the first row, maybe the second element is changed. But this seems too vague.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. Let's take the first row of input: 1 1 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 1 1. The output is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. So the first element is 1 in input, 2 in output. The second is 1 in input, 1 in output. Third is 2 in input, 1 in output. Fourth is 0. Fifth is 2 in input, 1 in output. Sixth is 1 in input, 1 in output. Seventh is 2 in input, 1 in output. Eighth is 0. Ninth is 2 in input, 1 in output. Tenth is 1 in input, 1 in output. Eleventh is 1 in input, 1 in output. So the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth elements are changed from 1 or 2 to 1 or 2. Wait, the first element is 1 in input and becomes 2. The third is 2 in input and becomes 1. The fifth is 2 in input and becomes 1. The seventh is 2 in input and becomes 1. The ninth is 2 in input and becomes 1. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their position in the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first row of example 1's output, the second element is 1. In example 2's first row, the first element is 2. Maybe the transformation is more complex.\n\nAnother approach: looking for symmetry. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have some symmetry. For instance, the first row of output is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. The first element is 2, the second is 1, third is 1, then 0, then 1s. The second row of output is 1 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 1 1. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are mirrored or transformed in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values based on their position. For example, in the first row of example 1's input, the first element is 2. In the output, it's 2. The second element is 2, but in output it's 1. The third is 1, same. Fourth is 0. Then fifth is 2, but in output it's 1. Sixth is 2, output is 1. Seventh is 2, output is 1. Then eighth is 0. Ninth is 1, same. Tenth is 2, output is 1. Eleventh is 1, same. So the second, fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth elements are changed. Maybe these positions are in the first row, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position in the grid. For example, in the first row, the second element is changed from 2 to 1. The fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth elements are changed. Maybe these are positions that are in certain columns. Let's think about the columns. The first row of input is 11 elements. Let's index them from 0 to 10.\n\nIn example 1's first row, the positions that change are 1, 4, 5, 6, 9. Let's see: 1 is the second column, 4 is fifth, 5 is sixth, 6 is seventh, 9 is tenth. Wait, maybe these are columns that are symmetric around the center. The center is at column 5 (since 11 columns, 0-10). So column 5 is the middle. Columns 1 and 9 are symmetric (since 1 + 9 = 10, which is 10). Similarly, 4 and 6 (4+6=10). Wait, 4+6 is 10, which is the total columns minus 1. So maybe for each row, the positions that are symmetric to the center are being modified. For example, in the first row, columns 1 and 9 are symmetric (since 1 and 9 are mirrored around 5). Similarly, columns 4 and 6 are mirrored. Column 5 is the center. So maybe for each row, certain positions are being modified based on their symmetry.\n\nLooking at example 1's first row output: the second element (column 1) is 1, and the tenth element (column 9) is 1. In the input, column 1 was 2 and column 9 was 2. So they are changed to 1. Similarly, column 4 (fifth element) was 2, and column 6 (seventh element) was 2, and they are changed to 1. Column 5 (seventh element?) Wait, the fifth element in the first row is column 4 (since indexes start at 0). Wait, maybe the positions that are mirrored around the center are being modified. For example, in the first row, the positions that are mirrored around column 5 (the center) are:\n\nFor column i, the mirror is 10 - i. Because 0 and 10 are mirrored, 1 and 9, 2 and 8, 3 and 7, 4 and 6, 5 is the center.\n\nSo for each row, maybe the values at positions i and 10 - i are being modified. For example, in the first row of example 1, the input is:\n\nOriginal values for columns 0-10: [2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\nIn the output, the first row is [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1].\n\nLooking at column 0: 2 remains 2. Column 1 (original 2) becomes 1. Column 2 (original 1) remains 1. Column 3 (original 0) remains 0. Column 4 (original 2) becomes 1. Column 5 (original 2) becomes 1. Column 6 (original 2) becomes 1. Column 7 (original 0) remains 0. Column 8 (original 1) remains 1. Column 9 (original 2) becomes 1. Column 10 (original 1) remains 1.\n\nSo for columns 1 and 9 (mirror positions), they are changed from 2 to 1. For columns 4 and 6 (mirror positions), they are changed from 2 to 1. Column 5 (the center) is changed from 2 to 1. Wait, but column 5 is the center. So maybe for each row, the values at positions that are mirrored around the center are being modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row, the values in columns that are not the center are being modified. For example, in the first row of example 1, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are modified. But why?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's first row, the values at positions 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are changed. Maybe these positions are part of a certain pattern. For example, maybe the center column (column 5) is being changed. Also, columns that are symmetric to the center. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, then apply a transformation. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2's first row input: 1 1 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 1 1. The output is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. So the first element is 1 in input, becomes 2. The third element is 2, becomes 1. The fifth is 2, becomes 1. The seventh is 2, becomes 1. The ninth is 2, becomes 1. So again, the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth elements are modified. But in this case, the first element is changed to 2, while in example 1's first row, the first element is unchanged. So this suggests that the pattern isn't consistent across all rows. Hmm.\n\nWait, in example 2's first row, the first element is changed. But in example 1's first row, the first element is not changed. So maybe the transformation is not uniform across all rows. That complicates things.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the first row is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. The second row is 1 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 1 1. The third row is 1 2 1 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 1. The fourth row is all zeros. The fifth row is 2 2 1 0 2 1 2 0 1 2 1. The sixth row is 1 2 2 0 1 2 1 0 1 1 2. The seventh row is 2 1 2 0 2 2 1 0 2 1 2. The eighth row is all zeros. The ninth row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 1. The tenth row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 2 2. The eleventh row is 2 2 2 0 1 2 2 0 2 2 2.\n\nLooking at the output, the first three rows seem to have some pattern. For example, the first row has 2, then 1s, then 0, then 1s. The second row starts with 1, then 2, then 1, then 0, then 2, then 1s. The third row starts with 1, 2, 1, then 0, then 1, 1, 2, 0, then 1, 2, 1. It's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves replacing certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's modified. But how?\n\nLooking at the first row of example 1's input and output, the first row of the output has 2 in the first position, then 1s, then 0, then 1s. The second row of the output starts with 1, then 2, then 1, then 0, then 2, then 1s. The third row starts with 1, 2, 1, then 0, then 1, 1, 2, then 0, then 1, 2, 1. It seems like the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their row and column.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for example 1's first row. The first element is 2, which is the same as input. The second element is 1. The third is 1. The fourth is 0. The fifth is 1. The sixth is 1. The seventh is 1. The eighth is 0. The ninth is 1. The tenth is 1. The eleventh is 1. So the first row of output has a pattern where the first element is 2, then 1s, then 0, then 1s. Maybe this is a pattern where the first row is transformed by replacing certain values based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position relative to the center. For example, if a cell is in the first row, then the second column is changed to 1. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by applying a certain rule to each cell. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, then it's modified. For example, in example 1's first row, the second column (position 1) is changed to 1. The fifth column (position 4) is changed to 1. The sixth (position 5) is changed to 1. The seventh (position 6) is changed to 1. The tenth (position 9) is changed to 1. But how to determine which positions to change?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1's first row, the values are 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1. So the pattern is 2 followed by 1, 1, 0, then 1, 1, 1, 0, then 1, 1, 1. So maybe the first row is transformed by replacing certain values based on their column. For example, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are being modified. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing the values in certain positions based on their row. For example, in the first row, the second column is changed. In the second row, the second column is 2 in input, but becomes 1 in output. Wait, in example 1's second row input is 1 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 1 2. The output is 1 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 1 1. So the third column (index 2) is changed from 2 to 1. The fifth column (index 4) is 2 in input, changed to 2 in output? Wait, no. Wait the input for the second row is 1 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 1 2. The output for the second row is 1 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 1 1. So the third column (index 2) is changed from 2 to 1. The sixth column (index 5) is 2 in input, changed to 1 in output. The seventh column (index 6) is 2 in input, changed to 1 in output. The tenth column (index 9) is 1 in input, changed to 1. So maybe in this row, columns 2, 5, 6 are modified.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern where, for each row, certain columns are modified based on their position relative to the center. For example, in the first row, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are modified. In the second row, columns 2, 5, 6 are modified. In the third row, columns 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 are modified. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values in the grid based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the first row, then certain columns are modified. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's first row, the second column is changed from 2 to 1. The fifth column is changed from 2 to 1. The sixth column is changed from 2 to 1. The seventh column is changed from 2 to 1. The tenth column is changed from 2 to 1. These are columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9. These columns are symmetric around the center. For example, column 1 and 9 are symmetric. Column 4 and 6 are symmetric. Column 5 is the center. So maybe for each row, the values at symmetric columns are being modified. For example, in the first row, the values at columns 1 and 9 are changed. Columns 4 and 6 are changed. Column 5 is changed. \n\nSo the transformation could be: for each row, for each column i, if i is not the center column (5), then check if i and 10 - i are symmetric. If so, replace the values at those positions with a certain value. But how?\n\nIn example 1's first row, the values at columns 1 and 9 are both 2 in input and become 1 in output. Similarly, columns 4 and 6 are 2 in input and become 1. Column 5 is 2 and becomes 1. So maybe the rule is: for each row, for each column i, if i is not the center column, then if i is in the first half of the row, replace the value at i and its mirror with 1. But how to determine which values to replace?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace the values at symmetric positions with 1, but only if the original value is 2. But this is just a hypothesis. Let's test it against example 1's first row.\n\nIn example 1's first row, columns 1 and 9 are both 2. So they are replaced with 1. Columns 4 and 6 are 2, replaced with 1. Column 5 is 2, replaced with 1. So that would explain the first row's output. Similarly, in example 2's first row, the input is 1 1 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 1 1. The output is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. So for the first row, columns 0 (value 1) is changed to 2. Column 2 (value 2) is changed to 1. Column 4 (value 2) is changed to 1. Column 6 (value 2) is changed to 1. Column 8 (value 2) is changed to 1. So this seems to fit the pattern where symmetric columns are modified. But why is column 0 changed to 2? Because it's the first column, which is mirrored with column 10. In the first row of example 2, column 0 is 1, and column 10 is 1. In the output, column 0 is 2, and column 10 is 1. Wait, that doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, then it's modified. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the pattern in the output of example 1's first row. The output for the first row is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. The input for the first row is 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 0 1 2 1. The output seems to have the first element as 2, then 1s, then 0, then 1s. The second element is 1, the third is 1, the fourth is 0, the fifth is 1, sixth is 1, seventh is 1, eighth is 0, ninth is 1, tenth is 1, eleventh is 1. So the pattern is that the first element is unchanged, then columns 1-3 are 1, 1, 0, then columns 4-7 are 1, 1, 1, 0, then columns 8-11 are 1, 1, 1. \n\nThis seems like a pattern where the first element is kept, then the next elements are modified to 1, 1, 0, and so on. But how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first row of example 1, the second element is changed from 2 to 1. The fifth element is changed from 2 to 1. The sixth is 2 to 1. The seventh is 2 to 1. The tenth is 2 to 1. So maybe these are positions that are in certain rows or columns. For example, in the first row, the second, fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth columns are being modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where the output is generated by replacing certain values with 1 if they are in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's first row, the values at columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are changed to 1. These columns are symmetric around the center. For example, column 1 and 9 are symmetric, column 4 and 6 are symmetric, and column 5 is the center. So maybe the transformation is to replace the values at symmetric columns with 1. But why would that be the case?\n\nLet's check example 2's first row. The input is 1 1 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 1 1. The output is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. The columns that are symmetric are:\n\n- column 0 and 10: 1 and 1 \u2192 output is 2 and 1. So column 0 is changed to 2, column 10 remains 1. That doesn't fit the previous pattern. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their row. For example, in example 1's first row, the first row is transformed by replacing certain columns with 1. In example 2's first row, the first row is transformed by replacing certain columns with 1 and 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting quite challenging. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's look at the outputs for example 1's rows.\n\nIn example 1, the first three rows of output are:\n\nRow 1: 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n\nRow 2: 1 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 1 1\n\nRow 3: 1 2 1 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 1\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 2 2 1 0 2 1 2 0 1 2 1\n\nRow 6: 1 2 2 0 1 2 1 0 1 1 2\n\nRow 7: 2 1 2 0 2 2 1 0 2 1 2\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 1\n\nRow 10: 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 2 2\n\nRow 11: 2 2 2 0 1 2 2 0 2 2 2\n\nLooking at these rows, there's a pattern where certain columns are modified. For example, in row 1, the second column is 1, third is 1, fourth is 0, fifth is 1, sixth is 1, seventh is 1, eighth is 0, ninth is 1, tenth is 1, eleventh is 1. \n\nIn row 2, the second column is 2, third is 1, fourth is 0, fifth is 2, sixth is 1, seventh is 1, eighth is 0, ninth is 1, tenth is 1, eleventh is 1. \n\nRow 3: second is 1, third is 2, fourth is 0, fifth is 1, sixth is 1, seventh is 2, eighth is 0, ninth is 1, tenth is 2, eleventh is 1.\n\nHmm. It's not clear. Maybe the pattern is that for each row, the values in certain columns are being modified based on their position. For example, in row 1, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are modified. In row 2, columns 2, 5, 6 are modified. In row 3, columns 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 are modified.\n\nThis seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern based on the row number. For example, row 1: modify columns 1,4,5,6,9. Row 2: columns 2,5,6. Row 3: columns 2,5,6,7,9. \n\nBut how to generalize this? It's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's first three rows, the middle columns (columns 4, 5, 6) are modified. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values based on their position in the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first row, the second column is changed to 1, and in the second row, the second column is 2, but in the output it's 2. Wait, no. In the second row of example 1's input, the second column is 2, and in the output it's 2. So this suggests that the transformation is not simply replacing certain columns with 1.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. Let's consider the test input and see what the output might be. But since I can't look at the test output, I need to focus on the training examples.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the middle rows (rows 4 and 8) are all zeros in both input and output. So those rows are unchanged. So perhaps the transformation is to leave those rows as is, and modify other rows based on some pattern.\n\nLooking at the other rows, perhaps the transformation involves modifying certain columns based on their position. For example, in rows 1-3 and 5-11, certain columns are modified.\n\nAnother idea: looking for patterns in the output of example 1's rows. For example, in the first three rows, the middle of the row (column 5) is 1 in the output. In the first row, column 5 is 1. In the second row, column 5 is 1. In the third row, column 5 is 1. In the fifth row, column 5 is 1. In the sixth row, column 5 is 2. In the seventh row, column 5 is 2. In the ninth row, column 5 is 2. In the tenth row, column 5 is 2. In the eleventh row, column 5 is 2. So this suggests that column 5 is modified in some rows but not others. This is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing values based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is in a certain range.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the pattern in the output of example 1's first row. The output for row 1 is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. The input is 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 0 1 2 1. The output seems to have a pattern where certain columns are replaced with 1, and others are kept. For example, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are replaced with 1. But why?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns that are not the center column are replaced with 1 if they are in certain positions. For example, in row 1, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are replaced with 1. In row 2, columns 2, 5, 6 are replaced with 1. In row 3, columns 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 are replaced with 1. This seems like a pattern where for each row, certain columns are replaced with 1 based on their position.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to replace? Maybe the columns that are in certain positions relative to the center. For example, in row 1, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are replaced. These are columns that are in the first half and second half of the row. For example, columns 1 and 9 are symmetric, columns 4 and 6 are symmetric, and column 5 is the center. So perhaps for each row, the columns that are symmetric around the center are replaced with 1, and the center column is also replaced.\n\nBut in example 2's first row, the input is 1 1 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 1 1. The output is 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1. So for this row, the first column (0) is changed to 2, and the tenth column (9) is 1. This doesn't fit the pattern. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on the input value. For example, if the input value is 2, replace it with 1. But in example 1's first row, some columns are 2 and are replaced with 1, but others are not. For example, in the first row, column 2 is 1, and it's not replaced. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the first row has 2 in the first column, then 1s, then 0, then 1s. This resembles a pattern where the first column is kept as is, but other columns are modified. But this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. Maybe I should try to think of a possible transformation that fits the examples. For example, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values in the grid based on their position in the grid. For example, for each cell (i, j), if j is in certain columns, replace it with 1. Or maybe it's based on the row and column indices.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's first row. The first element is 2, which is the same as input. The second element is 1. The third is 1. The fourth is 0. The fifth is 1. The sixth is 1. The seventh is 1. The eighth is 0. The ninth is 1. The tenth is 1. The eleventh is 1. So the pattern is that the first element is kept, then columns 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 are replaced with 1 or 0. This is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace the values in certain positions based on the row. For example, in rows 1-3, certain columns are replaced with 1, and in other rows, different columns are replaced.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to find a transformation that fits the examples. Let's think about the following hypothesis: for each row, replace the values at columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 with 1, and leave the rest as is. But this is just a guess.\n\nFor example, in example 1's first row, the columns 1,4,5,6,9 are replaced with 1. In example 2's first row, the columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 are replaced with 1 or 2. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, if the column is in the first half of the grid, replace it with 1. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother possible approach: looking at the outputs of the examples, the output for example 1's first row has a pattern where the first element is 2, then 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1. This resembles a pattern where the first element is kept, then the next elements are 1, 1, 0, then 1, 1, 1, 0, then 1, 1, 1. This could be a pattern where the middle of the row is replaced with 0, and the rest are 1. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to write a function that replaces certain values based on their position. For example, for each row, replace the values at columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 with 1, and leave the rest as is. Let's see if this works for example 1's first row.\n\nIn example 1's first row, input is [2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1]. Replacing columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 with 1 would give [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], which matches the output. For example 2's first row input [1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1], replacing columns 1,4,5,6,9 with 1 would give [1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. But the output for example 2's first row is [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. So the first element is 2 in the output, but according to this hypothesis, it would be 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 2's first row, the first element is 1 in input, and in the output it's 2. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain columns based on their position. For example, in row 1, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are replaced with 1. In row 2, columns 2, 5, 6 are replaced with 1. In row 3, columns 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 are replaced with 1. This seems like a pattern where for each row, the columns that are symmetric around the center are replaced with 1, but the exact columns vary.\n\nBut how to generalize this? It seems like for each row, the columns that are symmetric around the center are replaced with 1. For example, for row 1, columns 1 and 9 are symmetric, columns 4 and 6 are symmetric, and column 5 is the center. So replace those with 1. For row 2, columns 2 and 8 are symmetric, columns 5 and 5 (same column), and column 6 and 4? Not sure. This is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I think I need to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace the values at symmetric positions around the center with 1, and leave others as is. For example, for each row, for each column i, if i is not the center, then if i and 10 - i are symmetric, replace both with 1. But this might not fit all examples.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis for example 1's first row. Columns 1 and 9 are symmetric, so replace both with 1. Columns 4 and 6 are symmetric, replace both with 1. Column 5 is the center, replace with 1. This would give the first row of example 1's output. For example 2's first row, columns 0 and 10 are symmetric, so replace both with 1. But in the output, column 0 is 2 and column 10 is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace the values at symmetric positions with 1 if the original value is 2. For example, in example 1's first row, columns 1 and 9 are 2, so replaced with 1. Columns 4 and 6 are 2, replaced with 1. Column 5 is 2, replaced with 1. This would fit. For example 2's first row, columns 0 is 1, so not replaced. Column 2 is 2, replaced with 1. Column 4 is 2, replaced with 1. Column 6 is 2, replaced with 1. Column 8 is 2, replaced with 1. So the output would be [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. But the actual output is [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. So this suggests that column 0 is replaced with 2, which doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the values at symmetric columns are replaced with 1, and the center column is replaced with 1. This seems to fit example 1's first row, and perhaps other rows.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n    for each column i in 0-10:\n        if i is not the center (5):\n            j = 10 - i\n            if i < j:\n                if the original value at i is 2, replace with 1\n                if the original value at j is 2, replace with 1\n        else:\n            if original value is 2, replace with 1\n\nBut this might not work for all examples, but it's a possible approach.\n\nLet's test this for example 1's first row:\n\nOriginal values: [2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\nFor i=0, j=10: i=0 is not center. i < j (0 < 10). Original values at 0 is 2, replace with 1. j=10 is 1, no change. So after this, the values at 0 and 10 are 1 and 1.\n\nWait, but in the output, the first element is 2. So this suggests that this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace the values at symmetric positions with 1 only if the original value is 2. For example, in example 1's first row, the values at columns 1 and 9 are 2, so replaced with 1. Columns 4 and 6 are 2, replaced with 1. Column 5 is 2, replaced with 1. So the first row becomes [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], which matches the output. For example 2's first row, the input is [1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1]. The columns that are symmetric are 0 and 10, 1 and 9, 2 and 8, 3 and 7, 4 and 6. For each of these pairs, if the original value is 2, replace with 1. So for column 2 (value 2), replace with 1. Column 8 (value 2), replace with 1. Column 4 (value 2), replace with 1. Column 6 (value 1), no change. Column 0 (value 1), no change. Column 10 (value 1), no change. Column 1 (value 1), no change. Column 9 (value 1), no change. Column 3 (value 0), no change. Column 7 (value 0), no change. So the output would be [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. But the actual output for example 2's first row is [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. So the first element is 2, but according to this hypothesis, it would be 1. This suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in the actual output, the first element is 2. So why is that? Maybe the first element is not replaced, but the second element is replaced. This suggests that the transformation is not symmetric for all columns, but only for certain ones.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible hypothesis based on the examples I can see, even if it's not perfect. Let's assume that the transformation is to replace certain values in symmetric columns with 1, and leave others as is. For example, for each row, replace the values at columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 with 1, and leave others as is. This would fit example 1's first row.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n    new_row = list of values\n    for i in range(11):\n        if i in [1,4,5,6,9]:\n            new_row[i] = 1\n    return new_row\n\nBut this would not fit example 2's first row, where the first element is changed to 2. But perhaps this is a partial solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values based on their row. For example, in rows 1-3, replace certain columns with 1, in rows 5-11, replace other columns. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the values at columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are replaced with 1. This would fit example 1's first row. Let's see what happens to example 2's first row. The input for example 2's first row is [1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1]. Replacing columns 1,4,5,6,9 with 1 would give [1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. But the actual output for example 2's first row is [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. So the first element is 2, but according to this hypothesis, it would be 1. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the transformation is to replace certain columns based on their row. For example, in row 1, replace columns 1,4,5,6,9 with 1. In row 2, replace columns 2,5,6 with 1. In row 3, replace columns 2,5,6,7,9 with 1. In row 5, replace columns 1,4,5,6,9 with 1. This would be a possible pattern, but how to implement it?\n\nThis seems too complex, but maybe the transformation is to replace the values in certain columns based on the row number. For example, for row i, replace columns (i % 5) or something like that. But this is just guessing.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace certain columns with 1 based on their position, and implement a function that for each row, replaces certain columns with 1. For example, in the first three rows, replace columns 1,4,5,6,9 with 1. In the fifth row, replace columns 1,4,5,6,9 with 1. This might not fit all examples, but it's a possible approach.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = list(row)\n        # Replace certain columns with 1\n        # For example, columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9\n        for col in [1, 4, 5, 6, 9]:\n            new_row[col] = 1\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle the other rows correctly. For example, in example 1's second row, the input is [1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2]. Replacing columns 1,4,5,6,9 with 1 would give [1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2]. But the actual output for the second row is [1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Maybe the transformation is to replace the values in the grid based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, replace it with 1. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's first row, the values at columns 1,4,5,6,9 are 1. These columns are symmetric around the center. So for each row, the values at symmetric columns are replaced with 1. For example, for each row, for each column i, if i is not the center, then replace the value at i and 10 - i with 1 if the original value is 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this for example 1's first row. Columns 1 and 9 are 2, so replaced with 1. Columns 4 and 6 are 2, replaced with 1. Column 5 is 2, replaced with 1. This gives the correct output. For example 2's first row, the input is [1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1]. For columns 0 and 10: 1 and 1, no change. Columns 1 and 9: 1 and 1, no change. Columns 2 and 8: 2 and 2, replaced with 1. Columns 3 and 7: 0 and 0, no change. Columns 4 and 6: 2 and 1, replaced with 1. So the new row would be [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. But the actual output for example 2's first row is [2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. So the first element is 2, but according to this hypothesis, it would be 1. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in the actual output, the first element is 2. So why is that? Maybe the first element is not replaced, but the second element is replaced. This suggests that the transformation is not symmetric for all columns, but only for certain ones.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the values at columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 are replaced with 1. This fits example 1's first row, but not example 2's first row. However, it's possible that the transformation is more complex, and this is a partial solution.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = list(row)\n        for col in [1, 4, 5, 6, 9]:\n            new_row[col] = 1\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle all cases correctly. However, given the time constraints and the lack of a clear pattern, this is the best I can do.\n"
