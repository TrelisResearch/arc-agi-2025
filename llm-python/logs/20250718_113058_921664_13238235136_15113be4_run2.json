          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe that the transformation involves several patterns:\n\n1. **Preservation of certain values**: Some values like 4 and 0 remain unchanged in many positions.\n2. **Transformation of specific values**: Values like 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9 are transformed in specific patterns.\n3. **Replacement of values**: Some values are replaced with others in specific regions.\n4. **Consistency in patterns**: There seems to be a consistent pattern of value replacement in certain regions of the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with others in specific regions of the grid, while preserving others.\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define value replacement patterns\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex patterns may need to be added for full accuracy\n    value_replacements = {\n        1: 6,\n        3: 3,\n        6: 6,\n        8: 8,\n        9: 9\n    }\n    \n    # Apply value replacements in specific regions\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex patterns may need to be added for full accuracy\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(23):\n            if (i % 4 == 0 and j % 4 == 0) or (i % 4 == 3 and j % 4 == 3):\n                # Replace values in specific regions\n                if transformed_grid[i][j] in value_replacements:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = value_replacements[transformed_grid[i][j]]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define value replacement patterns\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex patterns may need to be added for full accuracy\n    value_replacements = {\n        1: 6,\n        3: 3,\n        6: 6,\n        8: 8,\n        9: 9\n    }\n    \n    # Apply value replacements in specific regions\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex patterns may need to be added for full accuracy\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(23):\n            if (i % 4 == 0 and j % 4 == 0) or (i % 4 == 3 and j % 4 == 3):\n                # Replace values in specific regions\n                if transformed_grid[i][j] in value_replacements:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = value_replacements[transformed_grid[i][j]]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe that the transformation involves several patterns:\n\n1. **Preservation of certain values**: Some values like 4 and 0 remain unchanged in many positions.\n2. **Transformation of specific values**: Values like 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9 are transformed in specific patterns.\n3. **Replacement of values**: Some values are replaced with others in specific regions.\n4. **Consistency in patterns**: There seems to be a consistent pattern of value replacement in certain regions of the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with others in specific regions of the grid, while preserving others.\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define value replacement patterns\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex patterns may need to be added for full accuracy\n    value_replacements = {\n        1: 6,\n        3: 3,\n        6: 6,\n        8: 8,\n        9: 9\n    }\n    \n    # Apply value replacements in specific regions\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex patterns may need to be added for full accuracy\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(23):\n            if (i % 4 == 0 and j % 4 == 0) or (i % 4 == 3 and j % 4 == 3):\n                # Replace values in specific regions\n                if transformed_grid[i][j] in value_replacements:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = value_replacements[transformed_grid[i][j]]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define value replacement patterns\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex patterns may need to be added for full accuracy\n    value_replacements = {\n        1: 6,\n        3: 3,\n        6: 6,\n        8: 8,\n        9: 9\n    }\n    \n    # Apply value replacements in specific regions\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex patterns may need to be added for full accuracy\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(23):\n            if (i % 4 == 0 and j % 4 == 0) or (i % 4 == 3 and j % 4 == 3):\n                # Replace values in specific regions\n                if transformed_grid[i][j] in value_replacements:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = value_replacements[transformed_grid[i][j]]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
