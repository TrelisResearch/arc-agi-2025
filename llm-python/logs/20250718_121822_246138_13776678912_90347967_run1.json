          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, there are three examples given. Let me look at them one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 7x9 grid. The output is also 7x9. The input has some numbers in the middle rows. For instance, the fourth row has 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. Wait, so the numbers 3, 2, 5 in the input's fourth row are transformed into 5, 2, 3 in the output's fourth row. Oh, but the output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the 5, 2, 3 are in positions 5, 6, 7 (assuming zero-based or one-based? Let me check the original input and output. The input's fourth row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the 3, 2, 5 in the input's row 4 (assuming rows are 0-indexed) are in columns 2,3,4. In the output, they are in columns 4,5,6. So maybe there's a reversal? Like the original numbers are reversed. Let me check the fifth row of input: 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm. Wait the fifth row of input is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that row didn't change. But the third row of input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output third row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. Wait, that's in the third row of output. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled based on some rule.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the third row of output is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. The input's third row is all zeros. So that's not helpful. Let me check the fourth row again. Input's fourth row has 3,2,5 in positions 2,3,4. The output's fourth row has 5,2,3 in positions 4,5,6. So maybe the numbers are reversed? Like, the original numbers in the input's row are 3,2,5. In the output, they are 5,2,3. So reversed. But then, in the fifth row of input, there's 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that's not reversed. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 2. Input is a 3x3 grid. The input is:\n\n6 0 0\n\n2 5 0\n\n2 1 0\n\nOutput is:\n\n0 1 2\n\n0 5 2\n\n0 0 6\n\nSo the output is rearranged. Let's see. The input's first row is 6,0,0. The output's first row is 0,1,2. The input's second row is 2,5,0. Output's second row is 0,5,2. The third row input is 2,1,0. Output is 0,0,6. So perhaps the output is taking the numbers from the input and rearranging them. For example, the first row of output is 0,1,2. The input's first row is 6,0,0. But 0,1,2 are not present in the input. Wait, but the input's third row is 2,1,0. So maybe the output is taking the numbers from the input and rearranging them in some way. For example, the output's first row is 0,1,2. The input's third row is 2,1,0. So maybe the output is taking the numbers from the third row and reversing them? But then the first row of output is 0,1,2. The third row of input is 2,1,0. So if you take the third row and reverse it, you get 0,1,2. That's the first row of output. Then the second row of output is 0,5,2. The input's second row is 2,5,0. If you take the second row and reverse it, you get 0,5,2. Which matches the output's second row. The third row of output is 0,0,6. The input's first row is 6,0,0. If you reverse that, you get 0,0,6. Which matches the output's third row. So this example seems to be reversing each row of the input and then putting them in the output rows in a certain order. Wait, but the output's rows are in the order of the input's third row, then input's second row, then input's first row. Because the output's first row is the reversed third input row, the second row is reversed second input row, third row is reversed first input row. So the output is taking the input rows in reverse order and then reversing each row. So for example, input rows are row 0, row 1, row 2. Output rows are reversed row 2, reversed row 1, reversed row 0. So for example, input row 2 is [2,1,0], reversed becomes [0,1,2], which is the first output row. Input row 1 is [2,5,0], reversed is [0,5,2], which is the second output row. Input row 0 is [6,0,0], reversed is [0,0,6], which is the third output row. So that's how Example 2 works. \n\nBut how does that relate to the other examples? Let's check Example 3. The input is a 9x9 grid. The output is also 9x9. Let's look at the input and output. For example, the third row of input is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the input's third row has 3,3,5 in positions 1,2,3. The output's third row has 5,3,3 in positions 3,4,5. So again, the numbers are reversed. But the output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the original input's third row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 3,3,5 in the input's third row are in positions 1,2,3. In the output, they are in positions 3,4,5. So maybe the numbers are reversed and placed in the middle. But how?\n\nLooking at the input's fourth row of Example 3: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no change. The input's fifth row is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So again, no change. The input's third row has some numbers that are reversed and placed in the output. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for each row in the input, the numbers are reversed and placed in the output. But in Example 2, the rows are reversed in order. But in Example 1, the output's third row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. The input's third row is all zeros. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the numbers 3,2,5 are in the input's row 4, columns 2,3,4. In the output, they are in columns 4,5,6. So that's a shift. Wait, maybe the numbers are being moved to the right? Or maybe the numbers are being reversed and placed in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the third row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. The input's third row is all zeros. So that's not helpful. But the fourth row of input has 3,2,5. The output's fourth row has 5,2,3. So that's reversed. The fifth row of input has 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is all zeros. So that's not reversed. But the sixth row of input is 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's sixth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So again, not reversed. \n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the numbers are reversed. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input is reversed to become the fourth row of output. But in the fifth row of input, the numbers are 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is all zeros. So that's not reversed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input has 3,2,5 in positions 2,3,4. The output's fourth row has 5,2,3 in positions 4,5,6. So maybe the numbers are being shifted to the right by two positions. But that's not consistent. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 3, the third row of input is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the numbers 3,3,5 are in positions 1,2,3 of the input. In the output, they are in positions 3,4,5. So that's a shift of two positions to the right. Similarly, the input's fourth row is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is all zeros. So no change. The input's fifth row is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is all zeros. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input's third row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 5 is moved to position 3 (original position 3), then 3,3 are moved to positions 4 and 5. So maybe the numbers are being reversed and placed in the middle. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the numbers are reversed and placed in the middle. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input has 3,2,5. The output's fourth row has 5,2,3. So that's reversed. But the fifth row of input has 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is all zeros. So that's not reversed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows that have numbers in certain positions, the numbers are reversed. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input has numbers in columns 2-4. The output's fourth row has those numbers reversed. \n\nBut how does that fit with Example 2? In Example 2, the input is a 3x3 grid. The output is the reversed rows, but in reverse order. So the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are in reverse order. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for each row in the input, we reverse the row and then place them in the output rows in reverse order. But in Example 1, that doesn't seem to fit. Let's check. \n\nIn Example 1, the input's rows are:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nIf we reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows, then the output would be:\n\nOriginal rows reversed:\n\nRow 6: all zeros \u2192 reversed is same.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0.\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nThen, reversing the order of these reversed rows would give:\n\nRow 6 \u2192 reversed row 6 is same. Then row 5, row 4, row 3, etc. So the output would be:\n\nRow 0 (original row 6) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 1 (original row 5) \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0.\n\nRow 2 (original row 4) \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0.\n\nRow 3 (original row 3) \u2192 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0.\n\nRow 4 (original row 2) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 5 (original row 1) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 6 (original row 0) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nBut the output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0.\n\nRow 4: all zeros.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nWhich matches exactly the output of Example 1. So that's the pattern. So the transformation is: for each row in the input, reverse the row, then reverse the order of the rows. \n\nSo for Example 2, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 6.\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 5 2.\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 1 2.\n\nThen, reverse the order of the rows: row 2, row 1, row 0. So the output rows are:\n\nrow 2 reversed \u2192 0 1 2.\n\nrow 1 reversed \u2192 0 5 2.\n\nrow 0 reversed \u2192 0 0 6.\n\nWhich matches the output of Example 2. \n\nFor Example 3, the input is a 9x9 grid. Let's check the third row. The input third row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. Which is exactly the output third row. The fourth row of input is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1. But the output's fourth row is all zeros. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, but according to the example, the output's fourth row is all zeros. But according to the pattern, the fourth row of input reversed would be 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1. But in the example, the output's fourth row is all zeros. So this contradicts the previous pattern. \n\nWait, what's the output for Example 3? The output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n\n0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the third row of output is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. Which is the reversed third row of input. But the fourth row of input is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1. But the output's fourth row is all zeros. So this contradicts the previous pattern. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. So why is the fourth row of input not being reversed in the output? \n\nWait, maybe the pattern is not to reverse all rows. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let me check the output of Example 3 again. \n\nIn Example 3, the input's third row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So that's reversed. The input's fourth row is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is all zeros. So that's not reversed. \n\nBut in Example 1, the fourth row of input is reversed. So why is there a discrepancy here? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the numbers are reversed, but not all. Maybe the rows that have numbers in certain positions. For example, in Example 3, the third row has numbers in the middle, so it's reversed. But the fourth row has numbers in the first two positions, so it's not reversed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but only for certain rows. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are reversed in order. But in Example 3, the output's third row is reversed, and the fourth row is not. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nBut in Example 1, the pattern holds. In Example 2, it holds. So maybe there's a different pattern. \n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but only for rows that have non-zero values. But that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has non-zero values. The fifth row has non-zero values. But the fifth row of input is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is all zeros. So that's not reversed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows where the first non-zero value is in a certain position, the row is reversed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are reversed in order. But in Example 3, the output's fourth row is not reversed. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but only for certain rows. For example, rows where the first non-zero value is in the first three columns. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me think again. \n\nIn Example 1, the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are reversed in order. So for the input rows, the output is the reversed rows in reverse order. \n\nBut in Example 3, the output's third row is the reversed of the input's third row. The fourth row of input is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is all zeros. So this doesn't fit. \n\nWait, but maybe in Example 3, the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are reversed in order. Let me check. \n\nOriginal input rows are 0-8. Reversed rows would be row 8, row 7, ..., row 0. Then, each row is reversed. \n\nBut in Example 3's output, the third row is the reversed of the input's third row. The fourth row is not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but only for certain rows. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are not reversed in order. \n\nBut how to reconcile this with the examples. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are not reversed in order. \n\nIn Example 1, the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are in the same order. But that doesn't fit. Because in Example 1, the fourth row of input is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. Which is the reversed of the input's fourth row. So if the output is the reversed rows of the input, but in the same order. Then for Example 1, the output would be:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 3: reversed of input's row 3 \u2192 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0.\n\nRow 4: reversed of input's row 4 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0.\n\nRow 5: reversed of input's row 5 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nBut the output of Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0.\n\nRow 4: all zeros.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nSo that's not matching. The output of Example 1 is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are in reverse order. \n\nSo for the input rows, the output rows are the reversed of the input rows, but in reverse order. \n\nSo for Example 1, the input rows are:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,3,2,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nReversed rows would be:\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed same.\n\nRow 5: [0,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0].\n\nRow 4: [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 3: [0,0,3,2,5,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed [0,0,0,0,5,2,3,0,0].\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nThen, reversing the order of these rows would give:\n\nRow 6 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 5 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0].\n\nRow 4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,5,2,3,0,0].\n\nRow 2 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 1 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 0 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nBut the output of Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0].\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,5,2,3,0,0].\n\nRow 4: all zeros.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nWhich matches exactly. So the pattern is: reverse each row of the input, then reverse the order of the rows. \n\nBut in Example 3, the output's fourth row is all zeros, while the input's fourth row is [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed, it would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1]. But the output's fourth row is all zeros. So this contradicts the pattern. \n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me check the output of Example 3 again. \n\nExample 3's input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the output's third row is the reversed of the input's third row. The input's third row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. Which matches the output's third row. \n\nThe output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. Which is the reversed of the input's second row? Wait the input's second row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. Wait no, the input's second row is row 2: 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's second row is row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. Which is not the reversed of the input's row 2. \n\nWait, the input's second row is row 2. The output's second row is row 1. So according to the pattern, the rows are reversed in order. So the input rows are reversed, then each row is reversed. \n\nBut in this case, the input rows are:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nRow 7: all zeros.\n\nRow 8: all zeros.\n\nReversing the rows would give:\n\nRow 8 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 7 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 6 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 5 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 4 \u2192 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2.\n\nRow 3 \u2192 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1.\n\nRow 2 \u2192 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0.\n\nRow 1 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 0 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nThen, reversing the order of these rows would give:\n\nRow 0 (original row 8) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 1 (original row 7) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 2 (original row 6) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 3 (original row 5) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 4 (original row 4) \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2.\n\nRow 5 (original row 3) \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1.\n\nRow 6 (original row 2) \u2192 0 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0.\n\nRow 7 (original row 1) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 8 (original row 0) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nBut the output of Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo the output's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. Which is the reversed of the input's row 4 (original row 4 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2], but the output's first row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. So there's a discrepancy. \n\nWait, the input's row 4 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. But the output's row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. So this doesn't match. \n\nHmm. This suggests that the pattern isn't consistent. But why does Example 1 and 2 fit, but not Example 3? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows that have non-zero values, the row is reversed, but for rows that are all zeros, they are left as is. But in Example 3's input row 4 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which is non-zero. So according to the pattern, it should be reversed. But the output's row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0], which is not the reversed of the input's row 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but only for certain rows. For example, rows where the first non-zero value is in the first three columns. \n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Given that the first two examples fit the pattern of reversing each row and then reversing the order of the rows, and the third example seems to have some exceptions, perhaps the correct pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, then the rows are reversed in order. \n\nEven though Example 3 seems to contradict this, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. \n\nIn Example 3's output, the third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. Which is the reversed of the input's third row (0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0). So that's correct. \n\nThe second row of output is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. Which is the reversed of the input's second row? The input's second row is row 2: 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0. But the output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So this doesn't match. \n\nBut according to the pattern, the rows are reversed in order. So the input rows are reversed, then the order of the rows is reversed. \n\nWait, the input's rows are 0-8. So the reversed rows would be row 8, row 7, ..., row 0. Then, each of those rows is reversed. \n\nSo for example, the input's row 2 is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0. \n\nThe input's row 3 is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1. \n\nThe input's row 4 is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. \n\nSo after reversing the rows, the rows are:\n\nrow 8: all zeros.\n\nrow 7: all zeros.\n\nrow 6: all zeros.\n\nrow 5: all zeros.\n\nrow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nrow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nrow 2: [0,0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0].\n\nrow 1: all zeros.\n\nrow 0: all zeros.\n\nThen, reversing the order of these rows gives:\n\nrow 0 (original row 8): all zeros.\n\nrow 1 (original row 7): all zeros.\n\nrow 2 (original row 6): all zeros.\n\nrow 3 (original row 5): all zeros.\n\nrow 4 (original row 4): [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nrow 5 (original row 3): [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nrow 6 (original row 2): [0,0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0].\n\nrow 7 (original row 1): all zeros.\n\nrow 8 (original row 0): all zeros.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 3: all zeros.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 7: all zeros.\n\nRow 8: all zeros.\n\nBut the actual output of Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo the output's row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. Which is not the same as the expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. \n\nSo there's a discrepancy here. But why? Maybe the pattern is not as simple as reversing rows and reversing the order. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the numbers are reversed, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 3, the output's row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. This is the reversed of the input's row 4, but with the 2 moved to position 6. But the input's row 4 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. But the output's row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. So it's not the same. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern is more complex. But given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement the pattern that works for the first two examples, and see if it passes the third example, even if there's a discrepancy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but only for certain rows. For example, rows that have non-zero values in the first three columns. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. \n\nGiven that the first two examples fit the pattern of reversing each row and reversing the order of the rows, and the third example has some discrepancies, but perhaps the third example's output is due to some other rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to reverse each row, then reverse the order of the rows, but with some exceptions. \n\nBut for the purpose of writing the code, perhaps the best approach is to implement the pattern that works for Examples 1 and 2, and see if it can be adjusted for Example 3. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid, reverse the row. Then, reverse the order of the rows. \n\nLet's test this for Example 3. \n\nInput for Example 3 is a 9x9 grid. \n\nReversing each row:\n\nRow 0: all zeros \u2192 reversed is same.\n\nRow 1: all zeros \u2192 same.\n\nRow 2: [0,3,3,5,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 3: [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nRow 4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nRow 5: all zeros \u2192 same.\n\nRow 6: all zeros \u2192 same.\n\nRow 7: all zeros \u2192 same.\n\nRow 8: all zeros \u2192 same.\n\nThen, reverse the order of the rows. So the new rows are:\n\nRow 8 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 7 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 6 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 5 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nRow 3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nRow 2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 1 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 0 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 3: all zeros.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 7: all zeros.\n\nRow 8: all zeros.\n\nBut the actual output of Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0].\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0].\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0,0].\n\nRow 3: all zeros.\n\nSo the output in Example 3 is different from what the pattern would produce. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Looking at Example 3's output, the row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. This is the reversed of the input's row 4, but with the 2 in position 6 instead of 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the numbers are reversed and placed in the output, but only for certain columns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but for rows that have a certain number of non-zero elements. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to tell. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I think the best approach is to proceed with the pattern that works for Examples 1 and 2, and see if it can be adjusted for the third example. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    # Reverse the order of the rows\n    transformed = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, the output of Example 3 would be different. However, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we apply the pattern, the code would reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows. \n\nLet's see:\n\nFor the test input, the sixth row (index 5) is [8,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8]. \n\nThe seventh row (index 6) is [0,3,3,2,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,2,3,3,0,0].\n\nThe eighth row (index 7) is [0,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,0].\n\nThe ninth row (index 8) is [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1].\n\nThen, reversing the order of the rows would give:\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1].\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,0].\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,2,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow 4: all zeros.\n\nRow 3: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nSo the output would have the sixth row (original row 5) as [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8]. But the test input's output is not given. \n\nBut the task is to write the code that implements the pattern observed from the training examples. \n\nGiven that the first two examples fit the pattern, and the third example may have some other rules, but the code is based on the first two examples, perhaps this is the best approach. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    transformed = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, the output of Example 3 is not matching this pattern. But perhaps the third example is an exception or there's a different pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to reverse each row, and then reverse the order of the rows, but for some rows, the reversal is not done. \n\nBut given that the user has provided three examples and the test input, and the code needs to handle the training examples as well as possible, I'll proceed with this code.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, there are three examples given. Let me look at them one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 7x9 grid. The output is also 7x9. The input has some numbers in the middle rows. For instance, the fourth row has 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. Wait, so the numbers 3, 2, 5 in the input's fourth row are transformed into 5, 2, 3 in the output's fourth row. Oh, but the output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the 5, 2, 3 are in positions 5, 6, 7 (assuming zero-based or one-based? Let me check the original input and output. The input's fourth row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the 3, 2, 5 in the input's row 4 (assuming rows are 0-indexed) are in columns 2,3,4. In the output, they are in columns 4,5,6. So maybe there's a reversal? Like the original numbers are reversed. Let me check the fifth row of input: 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm. Wait the fifth row of input is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that row didn't change. But the third row of input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output third row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. Wait, that's in the third row of output. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled based on some rule.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the third row of output is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. The input's third row is all zeros. So that's not helpful. Let me check the fourth row again. Input's fourth row has 3,2,5 in positions 2,3,4. The output's fourth row has 5,2,3 in positions 4,5,6. So maybe the numbers are reversed? Like, the original numbers in the input's row are 3,2,5. In the output, they are 5,2,3. So reversed. But then, in the fifth row of input, there's 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that's not reversed. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 2. Input is a 3x3 grid. The input is:\n\n6 0 0\n\n2 5 0\n\n2 1 0\n\nOutput is:\n\n0 1 2\n\n0 5 2\n\n0 0 6\n\nSo the output is rearranged. Let's see. The input's first row is 6,0,0. The output's first row is 0,1,2. The input's second row is 2,5,0. Output's second row is 0,5,2. The third row input is 2,1,0. Output is 0,0,6. So perhaps the output is taking the numbers from the input and rearranging them. For example, the first row of output is 0,1,2. The input's first row is 6,0,0. But 0,1,2 are not present in the input. Wait, but the input's third row is 2,1,0. So maybe the output is taking the numbers from the input and rearranging them in some way. For example, the output's first row is 0,1,2. The input's third row is 2,1,0. So maybe the output is taking the numbers from the third row and reversing them? But then the first row of output is 0,1,2. The third row of input is 2,1,0. So if you take the third row and reverse it, you get 0,1,2. That's the first row of output. Then the second row of output is 0,5,2. The input's second row is 2,5,0. If you take the second row and reverse it, you get 0,5,2. Which matches the output's second row. The third row of output is 0,0,6. The input's first row is 6,0,0. If you reverse that, you get 0,0,6. Which matches the output's third row. So this example seems to be reversing each row of the input and then putting them in the output rows in a certain order. Wait, but the output's rows are in the order of the input's third row, then input's second row, then input's first row. Because the output's first row is the reversed third input row, the second row is reversed second input row, third row is reversed first input row. So the output is taking the input rows in reverse order and then reversing each row. So for example, input rows are row 0, row 1, row 2. Output rows are reversed row 2, reversed row 1, reversed row 0. So for example, input row 2 is [2,1,0], reversed becomes [0,1,2], which is the first output row. Input row 1 is [2,5,0], reversed is [0,5,2], which is the second output row. Input row 0 is [6,0,0], reversed is [0,0,6], which is the third output row. So that's how Example 2 works. \n\nBut how does that relate to the other examples? Let's check Example 3. The input is a 9x9 grid. The output is also 9x9. Let's look at the input and output. For example, the third row of input is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the input's third row has 3,3,5 in positions 1,2,3. The output's third row has 5,3,3 in positions 3,4,5. So again, the numbers are reversed. But the output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the original input's third row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 3,3,5 in the input's third row are in positions 1,2,3. In the output, they are in positions 3,4,5. So maybe the numbers are reversed and placed in the middle. But how?\n\nLooking at the input's fourth row of Example 3: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no change. The input's fifth row is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So again, no change. The input's third row has some numbers that are reversed and placed in the output. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for each row in the input, the numbers are reversed and placed in the output. But in Example 2, the rows are reversed in order. But in Example 1, the output's third row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. The input's third row is all zeros. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the numbers 3,2,5 are in the input's row 4, columns 2,3,4. In the output, they are in columns 4,5,6. So that's a shift. Wait, maybe the numbers are being moved to the right? Or maybe the numbers are being reversed and placed in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the third row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. The input's third row is all zeros. So that's not helpful. But the fourth row of input has 3,2,5. The output's fourth row has 5,2,3. So that's reversed. The fifth row of input has 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is all zeros. So that's not reversed. But the sixth row of input is 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's sixth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So again, not reversed. \n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the numbers are reversed. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input is reversed to become the fourth row of output. But in the fifth row of input, the numbers are 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is all zeros. So that's not reversed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input has 3,2,5 in positions 2,3,4. The output's fourth row has 5,2,3 in positions 4,5,6. So maybe the numbers are being shifted to the right by two positions. But that's not consistent. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 3, the third row of input is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the numbers 3,3,5 are in positions 1,2,3 of the input. In the output, they are in positions 3,4,5. So that's a shift of two positions to the right. Similarly, the input's fourth row is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is all zeros. So no change. The input's fifth row is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is all zeros. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input's third row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 5 is moved to position 3 (original position 3), then 3,3 are moved to positions 4 and 5. So maybe the numbers are being reversed and placed in the middle. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the numbers are reversed and placed in the middle. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input has 3,2,5. The output's fourth row has 5,2,3. So that's reversed. But the fifth row of input has 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is all zeros. So that's not reversed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows that have numbers in certain positions, the numbers are reversed. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input has numbers in columns 2-4. The output's fourth row has those numbers reversed. \n\nBut how does that fit with Example 2? In Example 2, the input is a 3x3 grid. The output is the reversed rows, but in reverse order. So the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are in reverse order. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for each row in the input, we reverse the row and then place them in the output rows in reverse order. But in Example 1, that doesn't seem to fit. Let's check. \n\nIn Example 1, the input's rows are:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nIf we reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows, then the output would be:\n\nOriginal rows reversed:\n\nRow 6: all zeros \u2192 reversed is same.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0.\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nThen, reversing the order of these reversed rows would give:\n\nRow 6 \u2192 reversed row 6 is same. Then row 5, row 4, row 3, etc. So the output would be:\n\nRow 0 (original row 6) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 1 (original row 5) \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0.\n\nRow 2 (original row 4) \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0.\n\nRow 3 (original row 3) \u2192 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0.\n\nRow 4 (original row 2) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 5 (original row 1) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 6 (original row 0) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nBut the output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0.\n\nRow 4: all zeros.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nWhich matches exactly the output of Example 1. So that's the pattern. So the transformation is: for each row in the input, reverse the row, then reverse the order of the rows. \n\nSo for Example 2, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 6.\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 5 2.\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 1 2.\n\nThen, reverse the order of the rows: row 2, row 1, row 0. So the output rows are:\n\nrow 2 reversed \u2192 0 1 2.\n\nrow 1 reversed \u2192 0 5 2.\n\nrow 0 reversed \u2192 0 0 6.\n\nWhich matches the output of Example 2. \n\nFor Example 3, the input is a 9x9 grid. Let's check the third row. The input third row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. Which is exactly the output third row. The fourth row of input is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1. But the output's fourth row is all zeros. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, but according to the example, the output's fourth row is all zeros. But according to the pattern, the fourth row of input reversed would be 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1. But in the example, the output's fourth row is all zeros. So this contradicts the previous pattern. \n\nWait, what's the output for Example 3? The output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n\n0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the third row of output is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. Which is the reversed third row of input. But the fourth row of input is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1. But the output's fourth row is all zeros. So this contradicts the previous pattern. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. So why is the fourth row of input not being reversed in the output? \n\nWait, maybe the pattern is not to reverse all rows. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let me check the output of Example 3 again. \n\nIn Example 3, the input's third row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So that's reversed. The input's fourth row is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is all zeros. So that's not reversed. \n\nBut in Example 1, the fourth row of input is reversed. So why is there a discrepancy here? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the numbers are reversed, but not all. Maybe the rows that have numbers in certain positions. For example, in Example 3, the third row has numbers in the middle, so it's reversed. But the fourth row has numbers in the first two positions, so it's not reversed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but only for certain rows. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are reversed in order. But in Example 3, the output's third row is reversed, and the fourth row is not. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nBut in Example 1, the pattern holds. In Example 2, it holds. So maybe there's a different pattern. \n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but only for rows that have non-zero values. But that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has non-zero values. The fifth row has non-zero values. But the fifth row of input is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is all zeros. So that's not reversed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows where the first non-zero value is in a certain position, the row is reversed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are reversed in order. But in Example 3, the output's fourth row is not reversed. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but only for certain rows. For example, rows where the first non-zero value is in the first three columns. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me think again. \n\nIn Example 1, the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are reversed in order. So for the input rows, the output is the reversed rows in reverse order. \n\nBut in Example 3, the output's third row is the reversed of the input's third row. The fourth row of input is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is all zeros. So this doesn't fit. \n\nWait, but maybe in Example 3, the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are reversed in order. Let me check. \n\nOriginal input rows are 0-8. Reversed rows would be row 8, row 7, ..., row 0. Then, each row is reversed. \n\nBut in Example 3's output, the third row is the reversed of the input's third row. The fourth row is not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but only for certain rows. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are not reversed in order. \n\nBut how to reconcile this with the examples. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are not reversed in order. \n\nIn Example 1, the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are in the same order. But that doesn't fit. Because in Example 1, the fourth row of input is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. Which is the reversed of the input's fourth row. So if the output is the reversed rows of the input, but in the same order. Then for Example 1, the output would be:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 3: reversed of input's row 3 \u2192 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0.\n\nRow 4: reversed of input's row 4 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0.\n\nRow 5: reversed of input's row 5 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nBut the output of Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0.\n\nRow 4: all zeros.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nSo that's not matching. The output of Example 1 is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are in reverse order. \n\nSo for the input rows, the output rows are the reversed of the input rows, but in reverse order. \n\nSo for Example 1, the input rows are:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 3: [0,0,3,2,5,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nReversed rows would be:\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed same.\n\nRow 5: [0,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0].\n\nRow 4: [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 3: [0,0,3,2,5,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed [0,0,0,0,5,2,3,0,0].\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nThen, reversing the order of these rows would give:\n\nRow 6 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 5 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0].\n\nRow 4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,5,2,3,0,0].\n\nRow 2 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 1 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 0 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nBut the output of Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0].\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,5,2,3,0,0].\n\nRow 4: all zeros.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nWhich matches exactly. So the pattern is: reverse each row of the input, then reverse the order of the rows. \n\nBut in Example 3, the output's fourth row is all zeros, while the input's fourth row is [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed, it would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1]. But the output's fourth row is all zeros. So this contradicts the pattern. \n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me check the output of Example 3 again. \n\nExample 3's input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the output's third row is the reversed of the input's third row. The input's third row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. Which matches the output's third row. \n\nThe output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. Which is the reversed of the input's second row? Wait the input's second row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. Wait no, the input's second row is row 2: 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's second row is row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. Which is not the reversed of the input's row 2. \n\nWait, the input's second row is row 2. The output's second row is row 1. So according to the pattern, the rows are reversed in order. So the input rows are reversed, then each row is reversed. \n\nBut in this case, the input rows are:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nRow 7: all zeros.\n\nRow 8: all zeros.\n\nReversing the rows would give:\n\nRow 8 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 7 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 6 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 5 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 4 \u2192 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2.\n\nRow 3 \u2192 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1.\n\nRow 2 \u2192 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0.\n\nRow 1 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 0 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nThen, reversing the order of these rows would give:\n\nRow 0 (original row 8) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 1 (original row 7) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 2 (original row 6) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 3 (original row 5) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 4 (original row 4) \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2.\n\nRow 5 (original row 3) \u2192 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1.\n\nRow 6 (original row 2) \u2192 0 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0.\n\nRow 7 (original row 1) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 8 (original row 0) \u2192 all zeros.\n\nBut the output of Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo the output's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. Which is the reversed of the input's row 4 (original row 4 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2], but the output's first row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. So there's a discrepancy. \n\nWait, the input's row 4 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. But the output's row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. So this doesn't match. \n\nHmm. This suggests that the pattern isn't consistent. But why does Example 1 and 2 fit, but not Example 3? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows that have non-zero values, the row is reversed, but for rows that are all zeros, they are left as is. But in Example 3's input row 4 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], which is non-zero. So according to the pattern, it should be reversed. But the output's row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0], which is not the reversed of the input's row 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but only for certain rows. For example, rows where the first non-zero value is in the first three columns. \n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Given that the first two examples fit the pattern of reversing each row and then reversing the order of the rows, and the third example seems to have some exceptions, perhaps the correct pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, then the rows are reversed in order. \n\nEven though Example 3 seems to contradict this, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. \n\nIn Example 3's output, the third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. Which is the reversed of the input's third row (0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0). So that's correct. \n\nThe second row of output is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. Which is the reversed of the input's second row? The input's second row is row 2: 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0. But the output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So this doesn't match. \n\nBut according to the pattern, the rows are reversed in order. So the input rows are reversed, then the order of the rows is reversed. \n\nWait, the input's rows are 0-8. So the reversed rows would be row 8, row 7, ..., row 0. Then, each of those rows is reversed. \n\nSo for example, the input's row 2 is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0. \n\nThe input's row 3 is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1. \n\nThe input's row 4 is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. \n\nSo after reversing the rows, the rows are:\n\nrow 8: all zeros.\n\nrow 7: all zeros.\n\nrow 6: all zeros.\n\nrow 5: all zeros.\n\nrow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nrow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nrow 2: [0,0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0].\n\nrow 1: all zeros.\n\nrow 0: all zeros.\n\nThen, reversing the order of these rows gives:\n\nrow 0 (original row 8): all zeros.\n\nrow 1 (original row 7): all zeros.\n\nrow 2 (original row 6): all zeros.\n\nrow 3 (original row 5): all zeros.\n\nrow 4 (original row 4): [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nrow 5 (original row 3): [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nrow 6 (original row 2): [0,0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0].\n\nrow 7 (original row 1): all zeros.\n\nrow 8 (original row 0): all zeros.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 3: all zeros.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 7: all zeros.\n\nRow 8: all zeros.\n\nBut the actual output of Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo the output's row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. Which is not the same as the expected [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. \n\nSo there's a discrepancy here. But why? Maybe the pattern is not as simple as reversing rows and reversing the order. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the numbers are reversed, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 3, the output's row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. This is the reversed of the input's row 4, but with the 2 moved to position 6. But the input's row 4 is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2]. But the output's row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. So it's not the same. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern is more complex. But given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement the pattern that works for the first two examples, and see if it passes the third example, even if there's a discrepancy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but only for certain rows. For example, rows that have non-zero values in the first three columns. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. \n\nGiven that the first two examples fit the pattern of reversing each row and reversing the order of the rows, and the third example has some discrepancies, but perhaps the third example's output is due to some other rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to reverse each row, then reverse the order of the rows, but with some exceptions. \n\nBut for the purpose of writing the code, perhaps the best approach is to implement the pattern that works for Examples 1 and 2, and see if it can be adjusted for Example 3. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid, reverse the row. Then, reverse the order of the rows. \n\nLet's test this for Example 3. \n\nInput for Example 3 is a 9x9 grid. \n\nReversing each row:\n\nRow 0: all zeros \u2192 reversed is same.\n\nRow 1: all zeros \u2192 same.\n\nRow 2: [0,3,3,5,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 3: [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nRow 4: [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nRow 5: all zeros \u2192 same.\n\nRow 6: all zeros \u2192 same.\n\nRow 7: all zeros \u2192 same.\n\nRow 8: all zeros \u2192 same.\n\nThen, reverse the order of the rows. So the new rows are:\n\nRow 8 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 7 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 6 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 5 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 4 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nRow 3 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nRow 2 \u2192 [0,0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 1 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nRow 0 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 3: all zeros.\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1].\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 7: all zeros.\n\nRow 8: all zeros.\n\nBut the actual output of Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0].\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0].\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0,0].\n\nRow 3: all zeros.\n\nSo the output in Example 3 is different from what the pattern would produce. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Looking at Example 3's output, the row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]. This is the reversed of the input's row 4, but with the 2 in position 6 instead of 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the numbers are reversed and placed in the output, but only for certain columns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the reversed rows of the input, but for rows that have a certain number of non-zero elements. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to tell. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I think the best approach is to proceed with the pattern that works for Examples 1 and 2, and see if it can be adjusted for the third example. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    # Reverse the order of the rows\n    transformed = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, the output of Example 3 would be different. However, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we apply the pattern, the code would reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows. \n\nLet's see:\n\nFor the test input, the sixth row (index 5) is [8,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8]. \n\nThe seventh row (index 6) is [0,3,3,2,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,2,3,3,0,0].\n\nThe eighth row (index 7) is [0,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,0].\n\nThe ninth row (index 8) is [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1].\n\nThen, reversing the order of the rows would give:\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1].\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,0].\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,2,3,3,0,0].\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8].\n\nRow 4: all zeros.\n\nRow 3: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nSo the output would have the sixth row (original row 5) as [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8]. But the test input's output is not given. \n\nBut the task is to write the code that implements the pattern observed from the training examples. \n\nGiven that the first two examples fit the pattern, and the third example may have some other rules, but the code is based on the first two examples, perhaps this is the best approach. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    transformed = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, the output of Example 3 is not matching this pattern. But perhaps the third example is an exception or there's a different pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to reverse each row, and then reverse the order of the rows, but for some rows, the reversal is not done. \n\nBut given that the user has provided three examples and the test input, and the code needs to handle the training examples as well as possible, I'll proceed with this code.\n"
