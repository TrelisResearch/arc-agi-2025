          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve propagating values from certain positions to their neighbors.\n2. There's a pattern where certain values (like 2, 0, 1, 4) are spread out in specific ways.\n3. Values in the middle of the grid seem to influence their surrounding cells.\n4. There's a pattern where certain values are \"expanded\" or \"spread\" to neighboring cells.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves a kind of \"spread\" or \"propagation\" of values from certain positions to their neighbors, with some values being expanded more than others.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the size of the grid\n    rows = len(transformed_grid)\n    cols = len(transformed_grid[0])\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # If the cell is 0, try to spread the value from neighboring cells\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check all 8 neighboring cells\n                for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols:\n                            # If a neighboring cell has a value, spread it to this cell\n                            if transformed_grid[ni][nj] != 0:\n                                transformed_grid[i][j] = transformed_grid[ni][nj]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the size of the grid\n    rows = len(transformed_grid)\n    cols = len(transformed_grid[0])\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # If the cell is 0, try to spread the value from neighboring cells\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check all 8 neighboring cells\n                for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols:\n                            # If a neighboring cell has a value, spread it to this cell\n                            if transformed_grid[ni][nj] != 0:\n                                transformed_grid[i][j] = transformed_grid[ni][nj]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The transformation seems to involve propagating values from certain positions to their neighbors.\n2. There's a pattern where certain values (like 2, 0, 1, 4) are spread out in specific ways.\n3. Values in the middle of the grid seem to influence their surrounding cells.\n4. There's a pattern where certain values are \"expanded\" or \"spread\" to neighboring cells.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves a kind of \"spread\" or \"propagation\" of values from certain positions to their neighbors, with some values being expanded more than others.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the size of the grid\n    rows = len(transformed_grid)\n    cols = len(transformed_grid[0])\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # If the cell is 0, try to spread the value from neighboring cells\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check all 8 neighboring cells\n                for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols:\n                            # If a neighboring cell has a value, spread it to this cell\n                            if transformed_grid[ni][nj] != 0:\n                                transformed_grid[i][j] = transformed_grid[ni][nj]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the size of the grid\n    rows = len(transformed_grid)\n    cols = len(transformed_grid[0])\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # If the cell is 0, try to spread the value from neighboring cells\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check all 8 neighboring cells\n                for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                        if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols:\n                            # If a neighboring cell has a value, spread it to this cell\n                            if transformed_grid[ni][nj] != 0:\n                                transformed_grid[i][j] = transformed_grid[ni][nj]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
