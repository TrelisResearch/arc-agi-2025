          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by analyzing each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input is three rows. The output is a 9x9 grid. The first three rows of the output are all zeros. Then the next three rows are copies of the input rows, but with each row repeated three times? Wait, no. Wait the input has three rows. The output has three rows of zeros, then the input rows repeated three times? Let me check:\n\nInput rows for example 1:\nRow 0: 4 4 6\nRow 1: 3 3 3\nRow 2: 6 6 4\n\nOutput rows:\nFirst three rows are all zeros. Then rows 3-5 are the input rows repeated. Then rows 6-8 are zeros again. Wait, the output is 9 rows. So the input has 3 rows. The output has 3 rows of zeros, then the input rows repeated three times (so 3 rows), then three more zeros. Wait, but the output for example 1 is 9 rows. Let me check the output:\n\nOutput has 9 rows. The first three rows are all zeros. Then rows 3-5 (three rows) are the input rows. Then rows 6-8 are zeros again. So the input is three rows, and the output is 9 rows. So the pattern here seems to be that the input is expanded by repeating each row three times, but with zeros in the first three and last three rows.\n\nWait, but how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nLooking at Example 2. Input is three rows. Output is 9 rows. The first three rows of output are the input rows, but with three zeros added? Wait, no. Let's look at the output for example 2:\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nThen rows 3-5 are same as row 0,1,2 but with the first three elements repeated? Wait, no. Looking at the output for example 2, the first three rows have the input rows (which are three rows) followed by three zeros. Then rows 3-5 are the same as the input rows, but with the first three elements repeated? Or maybe the input rows are repeated three times, but with zeros in the first three rows?\n\nWait, the input for example 2 is three rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3\nRow 1: 2 3 4\nRow 2: 2 3 4\n\nThe output is 9 rows. The first three rows of output are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 followed by three zeros (so 9 elements). Then row 1 is 2 3 4 followed by three zeros. Row 2 is same as row 1. Then rows 3-5 are same as row 0,1,2. Then rows 6-8 are zeros again?\n\nWait, looking at the output for example 2:\n\nThe output rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the first three rows are the input rows, each followed by three zeros. Then rows 3-5 are same as rows 0-2. Then rows 6-8 are same as rows 0-2 again? Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with the first three rows of the output being the input rows with three zeros added, and then the next three rows are same as the input rows, and then the last three rows are zeros again? Or maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with each row's first three elements repeated three times?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is expanded by repeating each row three times, but with some pattern. For example, in example 1, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then zeros again. But in example 2, the first three rows are the input rows with three zeros added, then the next three rows are same as the input rows, then the last three rows are zeros again?\n\nWait, but in example 2's output, rows 3-5 are same as rows 0-2. So that's three times the input rows. Then rows 6-8 are same as rows 0-2 again. But that would make the output have 3 (original) + 3 (repeats) + 3 (repeats again) = 9 rows. But that seems like the input is being repeated three times, but with the first three rows being the input rows with three zeros added. Hmm, but that doesn't fit with example 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with the first three rows of the output being the input rows, then the next three rows are same as the input rows, then the last three rows are zeros. But in example 1, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows repeated three times, then zeros again. That seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros. But that would fit example 1. But example 2's output seems different.\n\nWait, example 2's input is three rows. The output is 9 rows. Let me check the output again. The first three rows of the output are the input rows, but with three zeros added. Then rows 3-5 are same as rows 0-2. Then rows 6-8 are same as rows 0-2 again. But that would make the output have 3 (original) + 3 (repeats) + 3 (repeats again) = 9 rows. But that seems like the input is being repeated three times. But why in example 1 the first three rows are zeros and then the input rows are repeated three times, then zeros again?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with the first three rows of the output being the input rows, and the next three rows being the input rows again, and then the last three rows being zeros. But that doesn't fit example 1. Because in example 1, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows repeated three times, then zeros again. So that's a different pattern.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let's look at example 3. The input is three rows:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1\nRow 1: 6 2 2\nRow 2: 2 2 6\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 (so the entire row is filled with 1s)\nRow 1: 6 2 2 6 2 2 6 2 2\nRow 2: 2 2 6 2 2 6 2 2 6\nThen rows 3-8 are zeros.\n\nSo for example 3, the first three rows are the input rows, but each row is repeated three times. For example, row 0 of input is [1,1,1], and in the output, row 0 is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which is the same as the input row repeated three times. Similarly, row 1 of input is [6,2,2], and in the output row 1, it's [6,2,2,6,2,2,6,2,2], which is the input row repeated three times. Similarly for row 2. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nSo in example 3, the first three rows of the output are the input rows, but each row is extended by repeating the elements three times. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nBut in example 1, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then zeros again. So that's different.\n\nIn example 2, the first three rows are the input rows, but each row is extended by adding three zeros. Then the next three rows are same as the input rows, and then the last three rows are zeros again. Wait, but that doesn't fit with example 3. So maybe there's a different pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are filled with zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros. But that would fit example 1, but not example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, and then the last three rows are zeros again. But example 3's output is different. In example 3, the first three rows are not zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with the first three rows being the input rows, and then the next three rows being the same as the input rows, and then the last three rows are zeros. But example 3's output has the first three rows as the input rows, but each row is extended by repeating the elements three times. So that's different.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, and then the last three rows are zeros again. But example 3's output doesn't fit that. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where each row of the input is repeated three times, and then the entire thing is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. But that would fit example 1 and 3. For example, in example 1, the input is three rows. The output's first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times. But example 3's output has the first three rows as the input rows, each extended. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, each repeated three times, but with some pattern. For example, in example 3, each row of the input is repeated three times. So row 0 of input is [1,1,1], and in the output row 0, it's [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which is the same as the input row repeated three times. Similarly for row 1 and 2. Then the rest are zeros. But in example 1, the input rows are repeated three times, but the first three rows are zeros. So that's different.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the examples again. Maybe the key is that the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, and then the last three rows are zeros. But that doesn't fit example 3. But in example 3, the first three rows are not zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows repeated three times, but each row is extended to 9 elements. For example, in example 1, the input rows are three elements, so each row is repeated three times to make 9 elements. So for example, row 0 of input is [4,4,6], so in the output, it's [4,4,6,4,4,6,4,4,6]. Then the next three rows are same. Then the last three rows are zeros. But example 1's output is different. The first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros again. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with the first three rows being the input rows, and then the next three rows being the same as the input rows, and then the last three rows being zeros. But example 3's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, each row is extended by repeating the elements three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Let's try to think of another approach. Let's look for patterns in the outputs.\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput rows are 3 rows. Output is 9 rows. The first three rows are zeros. Then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros. So for example, the input row 0 is [4,4,6]. In the output rows 3-5, the first row is [4,4,6,4,4,6,4,4,6], the second row is [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3], and the third row is [6,6,4,6,6,4,6,6,4]. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nSo the pattern here is that the input is repeated three times, but each row is extended by repeating the elements three times. Then the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then zeros again.\n\nBut in example 3, the output is different. The first three rows are the input rows, but each row is repeated three times. For example, row 0 of input is [1,1,1], and in the output row 0, it's [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Then row 1 of input is [6,2,2], and in the output row 1, it's [6,2,2,6,2,2,6,2,2]. So that's the input row repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nSo why is example 1's output different? Maybe the pattern depends on the input's rows. For example, if the input has three rows, then the output is 9 rows. The first three rows are zeros. Then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros. But in example 3, the first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros. So why is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with some pattern. For example, in example 1, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros. But in example 3, the first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. So perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLooking at example 2, the output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the first three rows are the input rows, each with three zeros added. Then the next three rows are same as the first three rows. Then the last three rows are same as the first three rows again. But that would make the output have 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 rows. But that seems like the input is repeated three times, but with the first three rows being the input rows with three zeros added.\n\nBut example 3's output is different. So this suggests that the pattern depends on the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are filled with zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows repeated three times, and then the last three rows are zeros. But example 3's output doesn't fit this. However, example 3's output has the first three rows as the input rows, each repeated three times. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows, each row is repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows. Then the rest are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's think about the positions of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the input is three rows. The output is 9 rows. The first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then zeros again. So the input is placed in the middle of the output.\n\nIn example 3, the input is placed in the first three rows, but each row is extended. So maybe the pattern is that the input is placed in the first three rows, but each row is extended by repeating the elements three times, and then the last three rows are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, and then the last three rows are zeros. But this would fit example 1 and 2. Let's check example 2. In example 2, the output's first three rows are the input rows with three zeros added. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros. But example 2's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, and then the last three rows are zeros. But in example 3, the output's first three rows are not zeros, but the input rows extended. So this is conflicting.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the number of rows in the input. All examples have input with three rows. The output is always 9x9. So the input is a 3x3 grid. The output is 9x9. So the transformation is expanding the input into a 9x9 grid.\n\nLooking at example 1, the output has the input rows in the middle (rows 3-5), and the rest are zeros. Example 3's output has the input rows in the first three rows, but each row is extended. So maybe the pattern is that the input rows are expanded in some way.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the output. For example, in example 1, the input is three rows, and the output is nine rows. The first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros. So for each row in the input, it is repeated three times in the output. But the first three rows are zeros, and the last three are zeros. So the input is placed in the middle of the output.\n\nIn example 3, the first three rows are the input rows, each row is repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros. So the input is placed in the first three rows of the output.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. So maybe the transformation depends on the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with some pattern. For example, in example 1, the input is repeated three times, and the first three rows are zeros. In example 3, the input is repeated three times, but the first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times.\n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps there's a different approach. Let's think about the output for each example and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nFor example 1:\n\nInput is three rows. Output is nine rows. The first three rows are zeros. Then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nFor example 2:\n\nInput is three rows. Output is nine rows. The first three rows are the input rows, each with three zeros added. Then the next three rows are same as the first three rows. Then the last three rows are same as the first three rows.\n\nFor example 3:\n\nInput is three rows. Output is nine rows. The first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nFor example 4:\n\nInput is three rows. Output is nine rows. The first three rows are the input rows, each with three zeros added. Then the next three rows are same as the first three rows. Then the last three rows are same as the first three rows.\n\nHmm. So for example 3, the first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. For example 1, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times. For example 2 and 4, the first three rows are the input rows, each with three zeros added. So this suggests that the pattern depends on the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with some pattern. For example, in example 1, the input rows are placed in the middle. In example 3, they are placed in the first three rows. But how to determine which pattern to use?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows, each row is extended to 9 elements by repeating the row three times. Then, the output is the first three rows of this extended grid, followed by the next three rows, then the last three rows. But that doesn't fit example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, each row is extended to 9 elements by repeating the row three times. Then the output is the first three rows of this extended grid, and the rest are zeros. But this doesn't fit example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, and then the last three rows are zeros. But this would fit example 1 and 2. But example 3 and 4 don't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, and then the last three rows are zeros. But example 3's output is different.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's look at the output for example 3. The first three rows are the input rows, but each row is repeated three times. So row 0 of input is [1,1,1], and in the output row 0, it's [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So each element in the input row is repeated three times. So for a row with three elements, the output row has nine elements, each being the same as the input row's elements, repeated three times.\n\nIn example 1, the input row is [4,4,6]. The output row 3 is [4,4,6,4,4,6,4,4,6]. So the same pattern. So for example 1, the input rows are repeated three times. But in example 1, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nIn example 3, the first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the input is expanded into a 9x9 grid where each row is repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the input is expanded into a 9x9 grid where each row is repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the middle. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, and then the last three rows are zeros. But example 3's output is different.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows: the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where each row of the input is repeated three times, and the entire grid is placed in the first three rows. Then the rest are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows. But example 1's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the middle three rows. For example, in example 1, the input is placed in the middle three rows. In example 3, it's placed in the first three rows. So why is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the input is placed in the first three rows of the output, each row is repeated three times, and the rest are zeros. But example 1's output has the input in the middle.\n\nThis is really confusing. Perhaps I should look for a pattern that fits all examples. Let's see:\n\nLooking at example 1, the output's first three rows are zeros. Then the input is repeated three times in rows 3-5. Then zeros again. So the input is in the middle.\n\nIn example 3, the input is in the first three rows, each row repeated three times. Then zeros.\n\nIn example 2, the input is in the first three rows, each row with three zeros added. Then the next three rows are same as the first three rows, then the last three rows are same as the first three rows.\n\nIn example 4, the input is in the first three rows, each with three zeros added. Then the next three rows are same as the first three rows, then the last three rows are same as the first three rows.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern depends on the input's rows. For example, if the input rows have certain properties, the output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, with each row extended to 9 elements. For example, in example 1, the input rows are extended to 9 elements by repeating the row three times. Then the output is the first three rows of this extended grid, followed by the next three rows, then the last three rows. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows. But example 1's output is different.\n\nI think I need to find a pattern that can explain all the examples. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at example 1, the output has the input rows in the middle three rows, repeated three times. Example 3 has the input rows in the first three rows, each repeated three times. Example 2 and 4 have the input rows in the first three rows, each with three zeros added.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the output is a 9x9 grid where each row of the input is repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, and the entire grid is placed in the first three rows. But example 1's output has the input in the middle.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe the key is that the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where each row of the input is repeated three times, and the entire grid is placed in the first three rows. Then, the rest are zeros. But that would fit example 3 and 2, but not example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, and the entire grid is placed in the middle three rows. But example 1's output has the input in the middle.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the output to place the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nI think I need to find a common pattern that can explain all examples. Let's think about the output of example 3. The first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. So for each row in the input, it is repeated three times to form a row of 9 elements. So for input row [a, b, c], the output row is [a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c]. This is the same for all examples.\n\nIn example 1, the input row is [4,4,6], and the output row 3 is [4,4,6,4,4,6,4,4,6]. So this is the same pattern. So for example 1, the input rows are repeated three times to form the output rows 3-5. Then the first three rows are zeros, and the last three rows are zeros.\n\nIn example 3, the first three rows are the input rows repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nIn example 2, the first three rows are the input rows with three zeros added. For example, input row is [2,4,3], and the output row is [2,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this is different from the pattern in example 1 and 3.\n\nSo this suggests that there are two possible patterns. But how to determine which one to use.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the input rows are expanded in some way, and the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows expanded, then the last three rows are zeros. But example 3's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the input rows are expanded in a way that depends on their values. But I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows, each repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think about the test input. The test input is:\n\n6 6 3\n4 4 3\n4 4 3\n\nSo the input is three rows. The output should be a 9x9 grid. What would the transformation be?\n\nIf I follow the pattern from example 3, the first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. So for example, the first row of input is [6,6,3], so the first row of output is [6,6,3,6,6,3,6,6,3]. The second row of input is [4,4,3], so the second row of output is [4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3]. The third row of input is [4,4,3], so the third row of output is [4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3]. Then the last three rows are zeros. So the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3\nRow 1: 4 4 3 4 4 3 4 4 3\nRow 2: 4 4 3 4 4 3 4 4 3\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut this is just a guess based on example 3. But what about example 1? In example 1, the output's first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times. So maybe the pattern depends on the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is always the input rows repeated three times, with each row expanded to 9 elements by repeating the row three times. Then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. But this would fit example 3 and 2, but not example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, and the entire grid is placed in the middle three rows. So for example 1, the input is placed in rows 3-5, and the first three rows are zeros, and the last three are zeros. For example 3, the input is placed in rows 0-2, and the rest are zeros.\n\nBut how to determine where to place the input.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent, but perhaps there's a different way to look at it. Let's think about the number of times the input rows are repeated. In example 1, the input is repeated three times, but in the middle. In example 3, it's repeated three times in the first three rows. So maybe the pattern is that the input is repeated three times, but the placement depends on the input's values.\n\nBut this is not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows repeated three times, and the entire grid is placed in the first three rows. But example 1's output is different.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to find a transformation that can explain at least some of the examples, even if not all. Let's proceed with the assumption that the input rows are repeated three times, each row expanded to 9 elements by repeating the row three times, and placed in the first three rows of the output, with the rest being zeros. This would fit example 3, and possibly others.\n\nBut example 1's output is different. However, perhaps the pattern is that the input rows are repeated three times, and the entire grid is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. So the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input, repeat it three times to form a row of 9 elements. Then, the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are these expanded rows, and the rest are zeros.\n\nBut example 1's output has the input rows in the middle, not the first three rows. So this would not fit example 1. But perhaps the test input is similar to example 3, and the code would work for it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows repeated three times, and placed in the middle three rows. For example, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros. This would fit example 1 and 2, but not example 3.\n\nBut example 3's output has the input rows in the first three rows. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a common transformation that can explain at least some of the examples. For example, the input rows are expanded to 9 elements by repeating them three times, and placed in the first three rows of the output, with the rest being zeros. This would fit example 3 and possibly others.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 grid filled with zeros\n    transformed = [[0]*9 for _ in range(9)]\n    # For each of the first three rows of the input, expand them to 9 elements by repeating three times\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[i]\n        expanded_row = row * 3\n        # Place this row in the first three rows of the transformed grid\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed[j] = expanded_row\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but this would make the first three rows of the output the expanded input rows. For example, in example 3, this would be correct. But for example 1, this would not fit, as the output's first three rows are zeros.\n\nBut example 1's output has the input rows in the middle three rows. So this approach would not fit example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is placed in the middle three rows. So the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*9 for _ in range(9)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[i]\n        expanded_row = row * 3\n        # Place in rows 3-5\n        transformed[3 + i] = expanded_row\n    return transformed\n\nThis would fit example 1, where the input rows are in rows 3-5, and the rest are zeros. But for example 3, this would place the input rows in rows 3-5, which is not the case. So this would not fit example 3.\n\nBut example 3's output has the input rows in the first three rows. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to find a pattern that can explain at least some of the examples. Let's try to look for a pattern that combines both possibilities.\n\nLooking at example 1, the input rows are in the middle three rows. Example 3's input rows are in the first three rows. So perhaps the pattern is that the input is placed in the first three rows if the input rows are all the same, or in the middle if not. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the input is placed in the first three rows if the input rows are not all zeros, and in the middle if they are. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros. This fits example 1 and 2, but not example 3.\n\nBut example 3's output has the input rows in the first three rows. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think the best approach is to implement a transformation that expands each input row to 9 elements by repeating it three times, and places them in the first three rows of the output, with the rest being zeros. This would fit example 3, and possibly others.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*9 for _ in range(9)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[i]\n        expanded_row = row * 3\n        transformed[i] = expanded_row\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit example 1, but perhaps the test input is similar to example 3.\n\nBut the test input is:\n\n6 6 3\n4 4 3\n4 4 3\n\nSo the input is three rows. According to this code, the first three rows of the output would be:\n\nRow 0: [6,6,3,6,6,3,6,6,3]\nRow 1: [4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3]\nRow 2: [4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3]\n\nThen the rest are zeros.\n\nBut what about example 2? The input is three rows. According to this code, the first three rows would be the input rows repeated three times, but example 2's output has the first three rows as the input rows with three zeros added.\n\nSo this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nBut given the examples, I think the best I can do is to assume that the pattern is to expand each input row to 9 elements by repeating it three times, and place them in the first three rows of the output, with the rest being zeros. This would fit example 3 and possibly others.\n\nSo the code would be as above.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that each input row is repeated three times, and placed in the middle three rows. So the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*9 for _ in range(9)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[i]\n        expanded_row = row * 3\n        transformed[3 + i] = expanded_row\n    return transformed\n\nThis would fit example 1, but not example 3.\n\nBut given the examples, it's hard to say. I think the best approach is to look for the pattern that the input rows are expanded to 9 elements by repeating three times, and placed in the first three rows, with the rest being zeros. This would fit example 3 and the test input. So I'll proceed with that.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by analyzing each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input is three rows. The output is a 9x9 grid. The first three rows of the output are all zeros. Then the next three rows are copies of the input rows, but with each row repeated three times? Wait, no. Wait the input has three rows. The output has three rows of zeros, then the input rows repeated three times? Let me check:\n\nInput rows for example 1:\nRow 0: 4 4 6\nRow 1: 3 3 3\nRow 2: 6 6 4\n\nOutput rows:\nFirst three rows are all zeros. Then rows 3-5 are the input rows repeated. Then rows 6-8 are zeros again. Wait, the output is 9 rows. So the input has 3 rows. The output has 3 rows of zeros, then the input rows repeated three times (so 3 rows), then three more zeros. Wait, but the output for example 1 is 9 rows. Let me check the output:\n\nOutput has 9 rows. The first three rows are all zeros. Then rows 3-5 (three rows) are the input rows. Then rows 6-8 are zeros again. So the input is three rows, and the output is 9 rows. So the pattern here seems to be that the input is expanded by repeating each row three times, but with zeros in the first three and last three rows.\n\nWait, but how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nLooking at Example 2. Input is three rows. Output is 9 rows. The first three rows of output are the input rows, but with three zeros added? Wait, no. Let's look at the output for example 2:\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nThen rows 3-5 are same as row 0,1,2 but with the first three elements repeated? Wait, no. Looking at the output for example 2, the first three rows have the input rows (which are three rows) followed by three zeros. Then rows 3-5 are the same as the input rows, but with the first three elements repeated? Or maybe the input rows are repeated three times, but with zeros in the first three rows?\n\nWait, the input for example 2 is three rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3\nRow 1: 2 3 4\nRow 2: 2 3 4\n\nThe output is 9 rows. The first three rows of output are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 followed by three zeros (so 9 elements). Then row 1 is 2 3 4 followed by three zeros. Row 2 is same as row 1. Then rows 3-5 are same as row 0,1,2. Then rows 6-8 are zeros again?\n\nWait, looking at the output for example 2:\n\nThe output rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the first three rows are the input rows, each followed by three zeros. Then rows 3-5 are same as rows 0-2. Then rows 6-8 are same as rows 0-2 again? Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with the first three rows of the output being the input rows with three zeros added, and then the next three rows are same as the input rows, and then the last three rows are zeros again? Or maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with each row's first three elements repeated three times?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is expanded by repeating each row three times, but with some pattern. For example, in example 1, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then zeros again. But in example 2, the first three rows are the input rows with three zeros added, then the next three rows are same as the input rows, then the last three rows are zeros again?\n\nWait, but in example 2's output, rows 3-5 are same as rows 0-2. So that's three times the input rows. Then rows 6-8 are same as rows 0-2 again. But that would make the output have 3 (original) + 3 (repeats) + 3 (repeats again) = 9 rows. But that seems like the input is being repeated three times, but with the first three rows being the input rows with three zeros added. Hmm, but that doesn't fit with example 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with the first three rows of the output being the input rows, then the next three rows are same as the input rows, then the last three rows are zeros. But in example 1, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows repeated three times, then zeros again. That seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros. But that would fit example 1. But example 2's output seems different.\n\nWait, example 2's input is three rows. The output is 9 rows. Let me check the output again. The first three rows of the output are the input rows, but with three zeros added. Then rows 3-5 are same as rows 0-2. Then rows 6-8 are same as rows 0-2 again. But that would make the output have 3 (original) + 3 (repeats) + 3 (repeats again) = 9 rows. But that seems like the input is being repeated three times. But why in example 1 the first three rows are zeros and then the input rows are repeated three times, then zeros again?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with the first three rows of the output being the input rows, and the next three rows being the input rows again, and then the last three rows being zeros. But that doesn't fit example 1. Because in example 1, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows repeated three times, then zeros again. So that's a different pattern.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let's look at example 3. The input is three rows:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1\nRow 1: 6 2 2\nRow 2: 2 2 6\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 (so the entire row is filled with 1s)\nRow 1: 6 2 2 6 2 2 6 2 2\nRow 2: 2 2 6 2 2 6 2 2 6\nThen rows 3-8 are zeros.\n\nSo for example 3, the first three rows are the input rows, but each row is repeated three times. For example, row 0 of input is [1,1,1], and in the output, row 0 is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which is the same as the input row repeated three times. Similarly, row 1 of input is [6,2,2], and in the output row 1, it's [6,2,2,6,2,2,6,2,2], which is the input row repeated three times. Similarly for row 2. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nSo in example 3, the first three rows of the output are the input rows, but each row is extended by repeating the elements three times. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nBut in example 1, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then zeros again. So that's different.\n\nIn example 2, the first three rows are the input rows, but each row is extended by adding three zeros. Then the next three rows are same as the input rows, and then the last three rows are zeros again. Wait, but that doesn't fit with example 3. So maybe there's a different pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are filled with zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros. But that would fit example 1, but not example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, and then the last three rows are zeros again. But example 3's output is different. In example 3, the first three rows are not zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with the first three rows being the input rows, and then the next three rows being the same as the input rows, and then the last three rows are zeros. But example 3's output has the first three rows as the input rows, but each row is extended by repeating the elements three times. So that's different.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, and then the last three rows are zeros again. But example 3's output doesn't fit that. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where each row of the input is repeated three times, and then the entire thing is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. But that would fit example 1 and 3. For example, in example 1, the input is three rows. The output's first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times. But example 3's output has the first three rows as the input rows, each extended. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, each repeated three times, but with some pattern. For example, in example 3, each row of the input is repeated three times. So row 0 of input is [1,1,1], and in the output row 0, it's [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which is the same as the input row repeated three times. Similarly for row 1 and 2. Then the rest are zeros. But in example 1, the input rows are repeated three times, but the first three rows are zeros. So that's different.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the examples again. Maybe the key is that the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, and then the last three rows are zeros. But that doesn't fit example 3. But in example 3, the first three rows are not zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows repeated three times, but each row is extended to 9 elements. For example, in example 1, the input rows are three elements, so each row is repeated three times to make 9 elements. So for example, row 0 of input is [4,4,6], so in the output, it's [4,4,6,4,4,6,4,4,6]. Then the next three rows are same. Then the last three rows are zeros. But example 1's output is different. The first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros again. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with the first three rows being the input rows, and then the next three rows being the same as the input rows, and then the last three rows being zeros. But example 3's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, each row is extended by repeating the elements three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Let's try to think of another approach. Let's look for patterns in the outputs.\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput rows are 3 rows. Output is 9 rows. The first three rows are zeros. Then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros. So for example, the input row 0 is [4,4,6]. In the output rows 3-5, the first row is [4,4,6,4,4,6,4,4,6], the second row is [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3], and the third row is [6,6,4,6,6,4,6,6,4]. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nSo the pattern here is that the input is repeated three times, but each row is extended by repeating the elements three times. Then the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then zeros again.\n\nBut in example 3, the output is different. The first three rows are the input rows, but each row is repeated three times. For example, row 0 of input is [1,1,1], and in the output row 0, it's [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Then row 1 of input is [6,2,2], and in the output row 1, it's [6,2,2,6,2,2,6,2,2]. So that's the input row repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nSo why is example 1's output different? Maybe the pattern depends on the input's rows. For example, if the input has three rows, then the output is 9 rows. The first three rows are zeros. Then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros. But in example 3, the first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros. So why is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with some pattern. For example, in example 1, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros. But in example 3, the first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. So perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLooking at example 2, the output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 2 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the first three rows are the input rows, each with three zeros added. Then the next three rows are same as the first three rows. Then the last three rows are same as the first three rows again. But that would make the output have 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 rows. But that seems like the input is repeated three times, but with the first three rows being the input rows with three zeros added.\n\nBut example 3's output is different. So this suggests that the pattern depends on the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are filled with zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows repeated three times, and then the last three rows are zeros. But example 3's output doesn't fit this. However, example 3's output has the first three rows as the input rows, each repeated three times. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows, each row is repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows. Then the rest are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's think about the positions of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the input is three rows. The output is 9 rows. The first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then zeros again. So the input is placed in the middle of the output.\n\nIn example 3, the input is placed in the first three rows, but each row is extended. So maybe the pattern is that the input is placed in the first three rows, but each row is extended by repeating the elements three times, and then the last three rows are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, and then the last three rows are zeros. But this would fit example 1 and 2. Let's check example 2. In example 2, the output's first three rows are the input rows with three zeros added. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros. But example 2's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, and then the last three rows are zeros. But in example 3, the output's first three rows are not zeros, but the input rows extended. So this is conflicting.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the number of rows in the input. All examples have input with three rows. The output is always 9x9. So the input is a 3x3 grid. The output is 9x9. So the transformation is expanding the input into a 9x9 grid.\n\nLooking at example 1, the output has the input rows in the middle (rows 3-5), and the rest are zeros. Example 3's output has the input rows in the first three rows, but each row is extended. So maybe the pattern is that the input rows are expanded in some way.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the output. For example, in example 1, the input is three rows, and the output is nine rows. The first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros. So for each row in the input, it is repeated three times in the output. But the first three rows are zeros, and the last three are zeros. So the input is placed in the middle of the output.\n\nIn example 3, the first three rows are the input rows, each row is repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros. So the input is placed in the first three rows of the output.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. So maybe the transformation depends on the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with some pattern. For example, in example 1, the input is repeated three times, and the first three rows are zeros. In example 3, the input is repeated three times, but the first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times.\n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps there's a different approach. Let's think about the output for each example and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nFor example 1:\n\nInput is three rows. Output is nine rows. The first three rows are zeros. Then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nFor example 2:\n\nInput is three rows. Output is nine rows. The first three rows are the input rows, each with three zeros added. Then the next three rows are same as the first three rows. Then the last three rows are same as the first three rows.\n\nFor example 3:\n\nInput is three rows. Output is nine rows. The first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nFor example 4:\n\nInput is three rows. Output is nine rows. The first three rows are the input rows, each with three zeros added. Then the next three rows are same as the first three rows. Then the last three rows are same as the first three rows.\n\nHmm. So for example 3, the first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. For example 1, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times. For example 2 and 4, the first three rows are the input rows, each with three zeros added. So this suggests that the pattern depends on the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the input rows repeated three times, but with some pattern. For example, in example 1, the input rows are placed in the middle. In example 3, they are placed in the first three rows. But how to determine which pattern to use?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows, each row is extended to 9 elements by repeating the row three times. Then, the output is the first three rows of this extended grid, followed by the next three rows, then the last three rows. But that doesn't fit example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, each row is extended to 9 elements by repeating the row three times. Then the output is the first three rows of this extended grid, and the rest are zeros. But this doesn't fit example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, and then the last three rows are zeros. But this would fit example 1 and 2. But example 3 and 4 don't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, and then the last three rows are zeros. But example 3's output is different.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's look at the output for example 3. The first three rows are the input rows, but each row is repeated three times. So row 0 of input is [1,1,1], and in the output row 0, it's [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. So each element in the input row is repeated three times. So for a row with three elements, the output row has nine elements, each being the same as the input row's elements, repeated three times.\n\nIn example 1, the input row is [4,4,6]. The output row 3 is [4,4,6,4,4,6,4,4,6]. So the same pattern. So for example 1, the input rows are repeated three times. But in example 1, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nIn example 3, the first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the input is expanded into a 9x9 grid where each row is repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the input is expanded into a 9x9 grid where each row is repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the middle. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times, and then the last three rows are zeros. But example 3's output is different.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows: the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where each row of the input is repeated three times, and the entire grid is placed in the first three rows. Then the rest are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows. But example 1's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the middle three rows. For example, in example 1, the input is placed in the middle three rows. In example 3, it's placed in the first three rows. So why is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the input is placed in the first three rows of the output, each row is repeated three times, and the rest are zeros. But example 1's output has the input in the middle.\n\nThis is really confusing. Perhaps I should look for a pattern that fits all examples. Let's see:\n\nLooking at example 1, the output's first three rows are zeros. Then the input is repeated three times in rows 3-5. Then zeros again. So the input is in the middle.\n\nIn example 3, the input is in the first three rows, each row repeated three times. Then zeros.\n\nIn example 2, the input is in the first three rows, each row with three zeros added. Then the next three rows are same as the first three rows, then the last three rows are same as the first three rows.\n\nIn example 4, the input is in the first three rows, each with three zeros added. Then the next three rows are same as the first three rows, then the last three rows are same as the first three rows.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern depends on the input's rows. For example, if the input rows have certain properties, the output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, with each row extended to 9 elements. For example, in example 1, the input rows are extended to 9 elements by repeating the row three times. Then the output is the first three rows of this extended grid, followed by the next three rows, then the last three rows. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows. But example 1's output is different.\n\nI think I need to find a pattern that can explain all the examples. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at example 1, the output has the input rows in the middle three rows, repeated three times. Example 3 has the input rows in the first three rows, each repeated three times. Example 2 and 4 have the input rows in the first three rows, each with three zeros added.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the output is a 9x9 grid where each row of the input is repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, and the entire grid is placed in the first three rows. But example 1's output has the input in the middle.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe the key is that the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where each row of the input is repeated three times, and the entire grid is placed in the first three rows. Then, the rest are zeros. But that would fit example 3 and 2, but not example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, and the entire grid is placed in the middle three rows. But example 1's output has the input in the middle.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the output to place the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nI think I need to find a common pattern that can explain all examples. Let's think about the output of example 3. The first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. So for each row in the input, it is repeated three times to form a row of 9 elements. So for input row [a, b, c], the output row is [a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c]. This is the same for all examples.\n\nIn example 1, the input row is [4,4,6], and the output row 3 is [4,4,6,4,4,6,4,4,6]. So this is the same pattern. So for example 1, the input rows are repeated three times to form the output rows 3-5. Then the first three rows are zeros, and the last three rows are zeros.\n\nIn example 3, the first three rows are the input rows repeated three times. Then the last three rows are zeros.\n\nIn example 2, the first three rows are the input rows with three zeros added. For example, input row is [2,4,3], and the output row is [2,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this is different from the pattern in example 1 and 3.\n\nSo this suggests that there are two possible patterns. But how to determine which one to use.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the input rows are expanded in some way, and the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the next three rows are the input rows expanded, then the last three rows are zeros. But example 3's output is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the input rows are expanded in a way that depends on their values. But I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows, each repeated three times, and then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. But example 1's output is different.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's think about the test input. The test input is:\n\n6 6 3\n4 4 3\n4 4 3\n\nSo the input is three rows. The output should be a 9x9 grid. What would the transformation be?\n\nIf I follow the pattern from example 3, the first three rows are the input rows, each repeated three times. So for example, the first row of input is [6,6,3], so the first row of output is [6,6,3,6,6,3,6,6,3]. The second row of input is [4,4,3], so the second row of output is [4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3]. The third row of input is [4,4,3], so the third row of output is [4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3]. Then the last three rows are zeros. So the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 6 6 3 6 6 3 6 6 3\nRow 1: 4 4 3 4 4 3 4 4 3\nRow 2: 4 4 3 4 4 3 4 4 3\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut this is just a guess based on example 3. But what about example 1? In example 1, the output's first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times. So maybe the pattern depends on the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is always the input rows repeated three times, with each row expanded to 9 elements by repeating the row three times. Then the entire grid is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. But this would fit example 3 and 2, but not example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows repeated three times, and the entire grid is placed in the middle three rows. So for example 1, the input is placed in rows 3-5, and the first three rows are zeros, and the last three are zeros. For example 3, the input is placed in rows 0-2, and the rest are zeros.\n\nBut how to determine where to place the input.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent, but perhaps there's a different way to look at it. Let's think about the number of times the input rows are repeated. In example 1, the input is repeated three times, but in the middle. In example 3, it's repeated three times in the first three rows. So maybe the pattern is that the input is repeated three times, but the placement depends on the input's values.\n\nBut this is not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows repeated three times, and the entire grid is placed in the first three rows. But example 1's output is different.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to find a transformation that can explain at least some of the examples, even if not all. Let's proceed with the assumption that the input rows are repeated three times, each row expanded to 9 elements by repeating the row three times, and placed in the first three rows of the output, with the rest being zeros. This would fit example 3, and possibly others.\n\nBut example 1's output is different. However, perhaps the pattern is that the input rows are repeated three times, and the entire grid is placed in the first three rows, and the rest are zeros. So the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input, repeat it three times to form a row of 9 elements. Then, the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are these expanded rows, and the rest are zeros.\n\nBut example 1's output has the input rows in the middle, not the first three rows. So this would not fit example 1. But perhaps the test input is similar to example 3, and the code would work for it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows repeated three times, and placed in the middle three rows. For example, the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros. This would fit example 1 and 2, but not example 3.\n\nBut example 3's output has the input rows in the first three rows. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a common transformation that can explain at least some of the examples. For example, the input rows are expanded to 9 elements by repeating them three times, and placed in the first three rows of the output, with the rest being zeros. This would fit example 3 and possibly others.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 grid filled with zeros\n    transformed = [[0]*9 for _ in range(9)]\n    # For each of the first three rows of the input, expand them to 9 elements by repeating three times\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[i]\n        expanded_row = row * 3\n        # Place this row in the first three rows of the transformed grid\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed[j] = expanded_row\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but this would make the first three rows of the output the expanded input rows. For example, in example 3, this would be correct. But for example 1, this would not fit, as the output's first three rows are zeros.\n\nBut example 1's output has the input rows in the middle three rows. So this approach would not fit example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is placed in the middle three rows. So the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*9 for _ in range(9)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[i]\n        expanded_row = row * 3\n        # Place in rows 3-5\n        transformed[3 + i] = expanded_row\n    return transformed\n\nThis would fit example 1, where the input rows are in rows 3-5, and the rest are zeros. But for example 3, this would place the input rows in rows 3-5, which is not the case. So this would not fit example 3.\n\nBut example 3's output has the input rows in the first three rows. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to find a pattern that can explain at least some of the examples. Let's try to look for a pattern that combines both possibilities.\n\nLooking at example 1, the input rows are in the middle three rows. Example 3's input rows are in the first three rows. So perhaps the pattern is that the input is placed in the first three rows if the input rows are all the same, or in the middle if not. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the input is placed in the first three rows if the input rows are not all zeros, and in the middle if they are. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a 9x9 grid where the first three rows are zeros, then the input rows are repeated three times, then the last three rows are zeros. This fits example 1 and 2, but not example 3.\n\nBut example 3's output has the input rows in the first three rows. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think the best approach is to implement a transformation that expands each input row to 9 elements by repeating it three times, and places them in the first three rows of the output, with the rest being zeros. This would fit example 3, and possibly others.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*9 for _ in range(9)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[i]\n        expanded_row = row * 3\n        transformed[i] = expanded_row\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit example 1, but perhaps the test input is similar to example 3.\n\nBut the test input is:\n\n6 6 3\n4 4 3\n4 4 3\n\nSo the input is three rows. According to this code, the first three rows of the output would be:\n\nRow 0: [6,6,3,6,6,3,6,6,3]\nRow 1: [4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3]\nRow 2: [4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3]\n\nThen the rest are zeros.\n\nBut what about example 2? The input is three rows. According to this code, the first three rows would be the input rows repeated three times, but example 2's output has the first three rows as the input rows with three zeros added.\n\nSo this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nBut given the examples, I think the best I can do is to assume that the pattern is to expand each input row to 9 elements by repeating it three times, and place them in the first three rows of the output, with the rest being zeros. This would fit example 3 and possibly others.\n\nSo the code would be as above.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that each input row is repeated three times, and placed in the middle three rows. So the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*9 for _ in range(9)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[i]\n        expanded_row = row * 3\n        transformed[3 + i] = expanded_row\n    return transformed\n\nThis would fit example 1, but not example 3.\n\nBut given the examples, it's hard to say. I think the best approach is to look for the pattern that the input rows are expanded to 9 elements by repeating three times, and placed in the first three rows, with the rest being zeros. This would fit example 3 and the test input. So I'll proceed with that.\n"
