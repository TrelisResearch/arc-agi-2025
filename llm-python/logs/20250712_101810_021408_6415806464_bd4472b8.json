          "Let's analyze the examples carefully:\n\n---\n\n**Observations from the textual examples:**\n\n- Input grid is always 8 rows, 3+ columns (sometimes 2, sometimes 3, sometimes more).\n- The top two rows contain non-zero values.\n- Rows 3 to 8 are zeroes.\n\n---\n\n### Example 1:\nInput (8x3):\n\n- row 0: [2 1 4]\n- row 1: [5 5 5]\n- rows 2-7: all zeros\n\nOutput (8x3):\n- rows 0-1 same as input rows 0-1\n- rows 2-7:\n  row 2: [2 2 2]\n  row 3: [1 1 1]\n  row 4: [4 4 4]\n  row 5: [2 2 2]\n  row 6: [1 1 1]\n  row 7: [4 4 4]\n\nSo from the first row of input, each element is repeated horizontally creating a full row, and these rows repeat twice (pattern: first, second, third elements from row 0 repeated, repeated twice each).\n\n---\n\n### Example 2:\n\nInput (10x4):\n- row 0: [3 2 1 4]\n- row 1: [5 5 5 5]\n- rows 2-9: zeros\n\nOutput (10x4):\n- rows 0-1 same as input rows 0-1\n- rows 2-9:\n  repeated the row0 elements each as a full row:\n  row 2: [3 3 3 3]\n  row 3: [2 2 2 2]\n  row 4: [1 1 1 1]\n  row 5: [4 4 4 4]\n  row 6: [3 3 3 3]\n  row 7: [2 2 2 2]\n  row 8: [1 1 1 1]\n  row 9: [4 4 4 4]\n\nAgain, values of row 0 repeated as full rows, copying two times in sequence.\n\n---\n\n### Example 3:\n\nInput (8x2):\n- row 0: [8 3]\n- row 1: [5 5]\n- rows 2-5: zeros\n\nOutput (6x2):\n- rows 0-1 same as input rows 0-1\n- rows 2-5:\n  rows 2: [8 8]\n  rows 3: [3 3]\n  rows 4: [8 8]\n  rows 5: [3 3]\n\nThis is the same pattern but only two distinct values in row 0, repeated twice each in full rows.\n\n---\n\n### Visual examples:\n\nThe visual grids and this textual formatting show the same idea:\n\n- Input top row has some colors\n- Output retains the top two rows unchanged\n- Then the first row's values are expanded into full rows, repeated twice vertically (or multiple times), each row filled with the same value repeated horizontally.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of pattern:\n\n- Take the input grid of size (>=8 rows, cols N).\n- Output grid must be exactly 8 rows tall, same number cols.\n- The first 2 rows in output are the same as input's first 2 rows.\n- The rest of the rows (6 remaining rows in output) are created by repeating each element of row 0 twice vertically, filling the entire row with that value.\n- The order repeats vertically, meaning the sequence of row 0's values repeated twice, repeated as needed to fill rows 2-7.\n- If the input grid is larger than 8 rows but output is always 8, only first 2 rows copied and rest constructed.\n\n---\n\n### Application to the test input (not requested but for checking):\n\nTest input top row: [1 2 3 4 8]\n\n- rows 0,1 output same as input\n- rows 2-7:\n  repeated vertically each element doubled:\n  2: [1 1 1 1 1]\n  3: [2 2 2 2 2]\n  4: [3 3 3 3 3]\n  5: [4 4 4 4 4]\n  6: [8 8 8 8 8]\n  7: [1 1 1 1 1]  # wrap around to start again, or could be cut off here\n  \nAs the examples showed the repetition twice, but length is fixed 8 rows, so if there are more values than leftover rows, truncate accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation details:\n\n- Input grid may vary in rows/cols but output always 8 rows, same cols.\n- Extract row 0 and row 1.\n- Initialize output grid with zeros.\n- Copy rows 0 and 1 from input to output.\n- Create rows 2 to 7 by repeating each element of row 0 as a full row, twice vertically.\n- The number of times the row0 values are repeated vertically is enough to fill rows 2-7 = 6 rows.\n- So the pattern is to repeat the row 0 elements twice in terms of vertical rows (2x number of elt in row0), but if more rows than 6, truncate, or repeat cyclically.\n\n---\n\nFinal plan:\n\n- Given first row length = n\n- We need 6 rows for repeating values.\n- The sequence to fill rows 2-7 is:\n\n  [ x0 repeated full row,\n\n    x1 repeated full row,\n\n    ..., x(n-1) repeated full row ] repeated as many times as needed to fill 6 rows, truncated to 6 rows.\n\n- Output is 8 rows total:\n\n  row 0: input row 0\n\n  row 1: input row 1\n\n  rows 2-7: repeated expansions of input row 0 elements.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
