          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 2s in certain positions, and the output has numbers like 1, 4, 8, etc. For instance, the fourth row of input has a 2 in the fifth column. In the output, that position becomes 2, but surrounding areas have numbers like 1, 8, 4. Wait, maybe there's a transformation based on the position of the 2s?\n\nAnother thing to note: The output grid is always 12x10. The input for example 1 is 12x10 as well. The test input is 24x17, but the output must be 12x10. Wait, no, the test input is 24 rows and 17 columns? Wait, the test input is given as 24 rows, each with 17 elements. But the output must be 12x10. So the transformation must take a grid of any size and output 12x10. But the training examples have inputs that are 12x10, and outputs also 12x10. So maybe the transformation is based on some pattern that depends on the input's structure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. Let's take the input's fourth row: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0. So the 2 in the input becomes 2 in the output, but the surrounding cells have 1s. Maybe the 2s are being replaced by their value, but the surrounding cells are being transformed based on some pattern.\n\nLooking at the fifth row of input: 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0. The output fifth row is 4 8 8 2 2 2 8 8 4 8. So the 2s are in the middle, and the surrounding cells are 4, 8, etc. Maybe the 2s are part of a group, and their positions are being transformed into some pattern. Also, the 4 and 8 seem to be related to the position of the 2s.\n\nAnother observation: In the output of example 1, the numbers 1, 4, 8, 2 are present. Maybe there's a relation between the original numbers and the output numbers. For example, 0s in the input might be transformed into 1s or 0s depending on their position. But that's not clear yet.\n\nLooking at the output of example 2. The input has a 2 in certain positions. The output has 1s and 8s around them. For example, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in the fourth column. The output's third row is 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is in the same position, but the surrounding cells are 1s. Wait, but in the output, the 2 is in the same position as the input. But in the fifth row of example 2, the input has a 2 in the fourth column, and the output has 2s in the middle. So maybe the 2s in the input are kept as is, but their surrounding cells are transformed based on some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid transformation where each cell is transformed based on its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 0, maybe it's transformed into a value based on the surrounding cells. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the first row is 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0. The 1s are at positions (0,0), (0,8), and the 4 is at (0,4). Maybe these positions are related to the original input's 2s. Let's see: the original input's fourth row has a 2 at (3,4). Maybe that's part of a pattern where the 2s are in certain positions, and the output has 1s and 4s around them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of grid where each cell is transformed based on the original cell's value and its position. For example, maybe the output cell is determined by the original cell's value and the distance from a certain point.\n\nWait, looking at example 1's output, the fifth row has 4 8 8 2 2 2 8 8 4 8. The 2s are in the middle. The 4s and 8s are on the sides. Maybe this is a pattern where the original 2s are in a line, and the output is filled with numbers based on their positions. For example, the 2s are in a horizontal line, and the output has 4s and 8s on either side. \n\nAnother thought: The output seems to have numbers that are related to the original numbers. For example, in example 1's input, there's a 2. In the output, the same position is 2. But in other positions, like the fifth row, the 2s are in the middle and the surrounding cells are 4 and 8. Maybe the 2s are part of a group, and the output is generated by some kind of expansion or pattern around them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by replacing 0s with 1s or 8s based on the proximity to 2s. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 2, it becomes 1 or 8. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2's input. The input has 2s in certain positions, and the output has 1s and 8s around them. For example, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in the fourth column. The output's third row is 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is in the same position, and the surrounding cells are 1s. Similarly, in the fifth row of example 2's input, there's a 2 in the fourth column. The output's fifth row is 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, but the input's fifth row is 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the output's fifth row is 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is in the same position, and the cells around it (positions 2 and 4) are 1s.\n\nThis suggests that 2s in the input are kept as 2s in the output, and their adjacent cells are transformed into 1s. But how about other numbers?\n\nLooking at example 1's input, there's a 2 in the fourth row, fifth column. The output's fourth row has 1 in positions 3 and 5. Wait, the fourth row of input is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is in the fifth column, and the cells to the left and right (columns 3 and 5) are 1 and 2. Wait, the cell to the left of the 2 is column 3 (value 1), and the cell to the right is column 5 (value 1). Wait, but the 2 is in column 4. So maybe the 2 is in the center of a pattern, and the surrounding cells are 1s. \n\nBut in the fifth row of example 1, the input has 2s in columns 3,4,5. The output has 4,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,4,8. So the 2s are in the middle, and the surrounding cells are 4 and 8. So maybe the 2s are part of a group, and their positions are transformed into a pattern where the 2s are in the center, and the surrounding cells are 4 and 8. \n\nThis seems like a pattern where the original 2s are part of a group, and the output is generated by some kind of expansion. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with numbers based on the position of the 2s. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 2, it becomes 1 or 8. But how?\n\nAnother observation: In example 1's output, the numbers 1, 4, 8, 2 are present. The 1s seem to be at the corners, and the 4s and 8s are in the middle. Maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where the 2s are part of a pattern that creates these numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation based on the original grid's structure. For example, the output is generated by replacing 0s with 1s and 8s based on the proximity to certain patterns.\n\nBut how to find a general rule?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of example 1. The output is 12x10. The input is also 12x10. So the transformation is applied to each cell. For each cell in the input, the output cell is determined by some function of the input cell's value and position.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0. The 1s are at positions (0,0) and (0,8), and the 4 is at (0,4). The 0s are in between. Maybe these positions are related to the original input's 2s. For example, the original input has a 2 in the fourth row, fifth column. The output's first row has a 4 in the middle. Maybe the 4 is related to the position of the 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where each cell is transformed based on the original cell's value and the distance from certain points. For example, if a cell is in a certain position relative to a 2, it's transformed into a certain value.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's look at example 2. The input has a 2 in the third row, fourth column. The output's third row has 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is in the same position. The 1s are adjacent to it. Similarly, in the fifth row of example 2, the input has a 2 in the fourth column, and the output has 1s on either side.\n\nThis suggests that 2s are kept as 2s, and their adjacent cells are transformed into 1s. But what about other numbers?\n\nLooking at example 1's input, there's a 2 in the fifth row, columns 3-5. The output's fifth row has 4, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 4, 8. So the 2s are in the middle, and the surrounding cells are 4 and 8. Maybe this is part of a pattern where the 2s are in a line, and the output is filled with numbers that depend on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where each cell is transformed based on the original cell's value and the position of the cell in the grid. For example, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1 if it's in a certain position, or 8 otherwise. But how?\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have a pattern where certain positions are filled with 1s, 4s, 8s, and 2s. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are at the corners and around the 2s. The 4s and 8s are in the middle. Maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 2s are part of a structure that creates these numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each cell is transformed based on the original cell's value and the position of the cell. For example, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1 if it's in a certain region, or 8 if in another. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where the 2s are replaced by 2s, and the surrounding cells are filled with numbers based on their distance from the 2s. For example, cells adjacent to a 2 are 1, cells two steps away are 4, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where each 0 is replaced with a number based on the number of surrounding 2s. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a grid that is a combination of the input's 2s and their positions. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is 1 if it's adjacent to a 2, and 8 otherwise. But in example 1's output, there are 4s and 8s, so this might not be the case.\n\nAnother thought: Looking at the output of example 1, the first row has 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0. The 4 is in the middle. Maybe this is part of a pattern where the 4 is generated based on the position of the 2s. For example, the 4 is at (0,4), which is the center of the first row. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a pattern where the 2s are in certain positions, and the output is a grid where the 2s are replaced by 2s, and the surrounding cells are filled with numbers based on their position relative to the 2s. For example, if a cell is in a certain position relative to a 2, it's transformed into 1, 4, or 8.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. However, given that the output for example 1 has 1s, 4s, and 8s, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with these numbers based on the input's 2s.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the output as a grid where each cell is transformed based on the original cell's value and its position. For example, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1 if it's in a certain position, or 8 otherwise. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the 0s are replaced with 1s or 8s based on their position. For example, the first row's first and last columns are 1s, and the middle is 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a grid where each cell is transformed based on the distance from the nearest 2 in the input. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 2, it becomes 1. If it's two steps away, it becomes 4, and so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where the 2s are part of a structure, and the output is a transformation that creates a pattern around them. For example, the 2s are in a line, and the output has 1s and 8s around them.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nGiven that the output is always 12x10, maybe the transformation is based on the input's structure. For example, if the input has a 2 in a certain position, the output has certain values around it.\n\nBut since the test input has a 2 in certain positions, and the output must be 12x10, perhaps the transformation is based on the input's 2s and their positions.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have 1s, 4s, and 8s in positions that are related to the input's 2s. For example, in example 1, the 2s are in certain positions, and the output has 1s around them. So maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 1s or 8s based on the proximity to 2s.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nPerhaps the transformation is as follows: For each cell in the output grid, if the original cell is 0, then the output cell is 1 if it's in a certain pattern, or 8 otherwise. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a grid where each cell is transformed based on the original cell's value. For example, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1. But in example 1's output, there are 4s and 8s, so this can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where each cell's value is determined by the original cell's value and the position. For example, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1 if the row is even, and 8 if the row is odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother thought: Looking at example 1's output, the first row has 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0. The 4 is in the middle. The fifth row of the output has 4, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 4, 8. The 4s are on the ends. Maybe this is part of a pattern where certain positions are filled with 4s and 8s based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 2s in the input are replaced by 2s, and the surrounding cells are filled with numbers based on their position. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 2, it becomes 1, and if it's two steps away, it becomes 4, and so on.\n\nBut how to implement this? For each cell in the output grid, check if it's adjacent to any 2 in the input. If yes, then output 1. Otherwise, output 8 or 4 based on some other condition.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's try to test it against the examples.\n\nIn example 1's input, the fourth row has a 2 in column 4. The output's fourth row has 1 in column 3 and 5. So adjacent cells are 1. That fits. The fifth row has 2s in columns 3-5. The output's fifth row has 4,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,4,8. So the cells adjacent to the 2s are 4 and 8. So maybe the distance from the 2s determines the output value. For example, cells at distance 1 (adjacent) are 1, distance 2 are 4, and distance 3 are 8. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where the 2s are part of a pattern, and the output is a transformation that creates a certain pattern around them. For example, the 2s are in a line, and the output has 1s and 8s around them.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know. Given that the test input has 2s in certain positions, I need to find a pattern that can handle that.\n\nAnother observation: The output for example 1 has 1s and 4s in certain positions. For example, the first row's 1s are at the ends, and the middle is 4. Maybe this is part of a pattern where the output is a grid that has 1s at the corners and 4s in the middle.\n\nBut how to relate this to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 2s are in certain positions, and the output is filled with numbers based on the distance from the nearest 2. For example, if the distance is 1, output 1; if distance is 2, output 4; if distance is 3, output 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n1. For each cell in the output grid, determine the distance to the nearest 2 in the input.\n2. Based on that distance, assign a value to the output cell.\n3. If the original cell is 2, keep it as 2.\n4. For other cells, assign values based on the distance.\n\nBut how to handle this for the test input, which has 2s in certain positions?\n\nLet's try this approach for example 1's input. The fourth row has a 2 in column 4. The distance from that 2 to the cell in (0,4) is 4 rows away. So the output cell would be 8, but in the first row, the cell (0,4) is 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is measured in a different way. For example, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1 if it's adjacent to a 2, and 8 otherwise. But in example 1's first row, the cell (0,4) is 4, which is not 1 or 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 2s are replaced by 2s, and the surrounding cells are filled with numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the first row, it's filled with 1, and if it's in the fifth row, it's filled with 4.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where the numbers are based on the original cell's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1 if row is even, 8 if odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 2s are in certain positions, and the output is filled with numbers based on the position of the 2s. For example, the 2s are in a line, and the output is filled with 1s and 8s around them.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern where the output is generated by replacing 0s with 1s or 8s based on their position relative to the 2s in the input.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the 2s are in certain positions, and the output has 1s around them. So maybe the output is generated by checking for each cell if it's adjacent to a 2. If yes, it becomes 1. Otherwise, it becomes 8. But in example 1's first row, the cell (0,4) is 4, which is not 1 or 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the 0s are replaced with 1s and 8s based on their position in the grid. For example, the first row's first and last columns are 1s, and the middle is 4. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother observation: In example 1's output, the first row has 1s at the ends, and the middle is 4. The fifth row has 4s at the ends and 8s in the middle. This suggests that the output is generated based on the row and column indices, not the input.\n\nBut this would mean that the transformation is based on the input's structure, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where the numbers are based on the position of the cell in the output grid. For example, the first row has 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0. This could be a pattern where the first and last columns are 1, and the middle is 4. But how does this relate to the input?\n\nThis is getting too vague. Given the time, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern where the output is generated by replacing 0s with 1s or 8s based on their position in the grid, and the 2s are kept as is.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of grid where the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in certain positions, and 8s otherwise. For example, in the first row, the 0s are replaced with 1s at the ends and 4 in the middle. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have a pattern where the numbers are based on the row and column indices. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 1s at (0,0) and (0,8), which are the corners. The middle is 4. This could be part of a pattern where the output is filled with 1s at the corners and 4 in the middle. But how to relate this to the input?\n\nThis is not helpful. Given the time, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLet me try to think of the transformation as follows:\n\n- For each cell in the output grid, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1 if the cell is in a certain position, or 8 otherwise.\n- If the original cell is 2, then the output is 2.\n- For other values (like 0, 2), the output is based on the position.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are 1 or 8.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has 1s at (0,0) and (0,8). The fifth row has 4s at (4,0) and (4,8), and 8s in the middle. So maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the first and last columns are 1s, and the middle columns are 4s or 8s based on their position.\n\nBut this doesn't account for the 2s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the first or last column, and 8s otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can explain both examples. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s around the 2s, and in example 2, the output has 1s around the 2s as well. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if they are adjacent to 2s, and 8s otherwise. But how to handle the 4s and other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the same row or column as a 2, and 8s otherwise. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nIn the absence of a clear pattern, perhaps the best approach is to write code that replaces 0s with 1s if they are adjacent to a 2, and 8s otherwise, and leaves 2s as is. This might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nLet's try to code this:\n\nFor each cell in the output grid:\n\n- If the original cell is 2, output 2.\n- Else, check if the cell is adjacent to any 2 in the input. If yes, output 1.\n- Else, output 8.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the cell (0,4) is 4, which would not fit this pattern. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in certain positions, like the first or last column, and 8s otherwise.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 0s are replaced with 1s if the row is even, and 8 if odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to make a best guess. Based on the examples, it seems that the 2s are kept as 2s, and the 0s are replaced with 1s or 8s based on their position relative to the 2s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother observation: In example 1's output, the first row has 1s at the ends and 4 in the middle. The fifth row has 4 at the ends and 8 in the middle. This suggests that the output is generated by a pattern where the first and last columns are 1s or 4s based on the row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the numbers are based on the row and column indices. For example, the value is 1 if the row is even and column is 0 or 8, 4 if row is even and column is 4, and 8 otherwise.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\n- For each cell in the output grid, if the original cell is 2, output 2.\n- Otherwise, if the cell is 0, output 1 if it is in a certain position, else 8.\n- But how to determine the certain position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a pattern where the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the first or last column, and 8 otherwise.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach and write code that replaces 0s with 1s if they are in the first or last column, and 8 otherwise, and leaves 2s as is. This might not work for all examples, but it's a start.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the first and last columns are 1s, which fits. The middle is 4, which is not 1 or 8. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have a pattern where the numbers are based on the row and column indices. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0. This could be a pattern where the value is 1 if the column is 0 or 8, 4 if column is 4, and 0 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to relate this to the input.\n\nThis is not helpful. Given the time, I think I need to proceed with the code that replaces 0s with 1s if they are adjacent to 2s, and 8 otherwise. This might not work for all cases, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new 12x10 grid\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(12)]\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                output[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                # Check if the cell is adjacent to any 2 in the input\n                adjacent = False\n                for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                        if 0 <= ni < 12 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                            if grid[ni][nj] == 2:\n                                adjacent = True\n                                break\n                    if adjacent:\n                        break\n                if adjacent:\n                    output[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    output[i][j] = 8\n    return output\n\nBut this might not work for the examples. For example, in example 1's first row, the cell (0,4) is 4, but according to this code, it would be 1 or 8. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach and see if it fits the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some other pattern. For example, the output is generated by replacing 0s with 1s if they are in the first or last column, and 8s otherwise. But this would not explain the 4s in example 1.\n\nIn the absence of a clear pattern, I think the best I can do is to write code that replaces 0s with 1s if they are adjacent to 2s, and 8s otherwise, and leaves 2s as is. This is my best guess based on the examples.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 2s in certain positions, and the output has numbers like 1, 4, 8, etc. For instance, the fourth row of input has a 2 in the fifth column. In the output, that position becomes 2, but surrounding areas have numbers like 1, 8, 4. Wait, maybe there's a transformation based on the position of the 2s?\n\nAnother thing to note: The output grid is always 12x10. The input for example 1 is 12x10 as well. The test input is 24x17, but the output must be 12x10. Wait, no, the test input is 24 rows and 17 columns? Wait, the test input is given as 24 rows, each with 17 elements. But the output must be 12x10. So the transformation must take a grid of any size and output 12x10. But the training examples have inputs that are 12x10, and outputs also 12x10. So maybe the transformation is based on some pattern that depends on the input's structure.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. Let's take the input's fourth row: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0. So the 2 in the input becomes 2 in the output, but the surrounding cells have 1s. Maybe the 2s are being replaced by their value, but the surrounding cells are being transformed based on some pattern.\n\nLooking at the fifth row of input: 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0. The output fifth row is 4 8 8 2 2 2 8 8 4 8. So the 2s are in the middle, and the surrounding cells are 4, 8, etc. Maybe the 2s are part of a group, and their positions are being transformed into some pattern. Also, the 4 and 8 seem to be related to the position of the 2s.\n\nAnother observation: In the output of example 1, the numbers 1, 4, 8, 2 are present. Maybe there's a relation between the original numbers and the output numbers. For example, 0s in the input might be transformed into 1s or 0s depending on their position. But that's not clear yet.\n\nLooking at the output of example 2. The input has a 2 in certain positions. The output has 1s and 8s around them. For example, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in the fourth column. The output's third row is 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is in the same position, but the surrounding cells are 1s. Wait, but in the output, the 2 is in the same position as the input. But in the fifth row of example 2, the input has a 2 in the fourth column, and the output has 2s in the middle. So maybe the 2s in the input are kept as is, but their surrounding cells are transformed based on some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid transformation where each cell is transformed based on its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 0, maybe it's transformed into a value based on the surrounding cells. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the first row is 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0. The 1s are at positions (0,0), (0,8), and the 4 is at (0,4). Maybe these positions are related to the original input's 2s. Let's see: the original input's fourth row has a 2 at (3,4). Maybe that's part of a pattern where the 2s are in certain positions, and the output has 1s and 4s around them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of grid where each cell is transformed based on the original cell's value and its position. For example, maybe the output cell is determined by the original cell's value and the distance from a certain point.\n\nWait, looking at example 1's output, the fifth row has 4 8 8 2 2 2 8 8 4 8. The 2s are in the middle. The 4s and 8s are on the sides. Maybe this is a pattern where the original 2s are in a line, and the output is filled with numbers based on their positions. For example, the 2s are in a horizontal line, and the output has 4s and 8s on either side. \n\nAnother thought: The output seems to have numbers that are related to the original numbers. For example, in example 1's input, there's a 2. In the output, the same position is 2. But in other positions, like the fifth row, the 2s are in the middle and the surrounding cells are 4 and 8. Maybe the 2s are part of a group, and the output is generated by some kind of expansion or pattern around them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by replacing 0s with 1s or 8s based on the proximity to 2s. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 2, it becomes 1 or 8. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2's input. The input has 2s in certain positions, and the output has 1s and 8s around them. For example, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in the fourth column. The output's third row is 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is in the same position, and the surrounding cells are 1s. Similarly, in the fifth row of example 2's input, there's a 2 in the fourth column. The output's fifth row is 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, but the input's fifth row is 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the output's fifth row is 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is in the same position, and the cells around it (positions 2 and 4) are 1s.\n\nThis suggests that 2s in the input are kept as 2s in the output, and their adjacent cells are transformed into 1s. But how about other numbers?\n\nLooking at example 1's input, there's a 2 in the fourth row, fifth column. The output's fourth row has 1 in positions 3 and 5. Wait, the fourth row of input is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is in the fifth column, and the cells to the left and right (columns 3 and 5) are 1 and 2. Wait, the cell to the left of the 2 is column 3 (value 1), and the cell to the right is column 5 (value 1). Wait, but the 2 is in column 4. So maybe the 2 is in the center of a pattern, and the surrounding cells are 1s. \n\nBut in the fifth row of example 1, the input has 2s in columns 3,4,5. The output has 4,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,4,8. So the 2s are in the middle, and the surrounding cells are 4 and 8. So maybe the 2s are part of a group, and their positions are transformed into a pattern where the 2s are in the center, and the surrounding cells are 4 and 8. \n\nThis seems like a pattern where the original 2s are part of a group, and the output is generated by some kind of expansion. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with numbers based on the position of the 2s. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 2, it becomes 1 or 8. But how?\n\nAnother observation: In example 1's output, the numbers 1, 4, 8, 2 are present. The 1s seem to be at the corners, and the 4s and 8s are in the middle. Maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where the 2s are part of a pattern that creates these numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation based on the original grid's structure. For example, the output is generated by replacing 0s with 1s and 8s based on the proximity to certain patterns.\n\nBut how to find a general rule?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of example 1. The output is 12x10. The input is also 12x10. So the transformation is applied to each cell. For each cell in the input, the output cell is determined by some function of the input cell's value and position.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0. The 1s are at positions (0,0) and (0,8), and the 4 is at (0,4). The 0s are in between. Maybe these positions are related to the original input's 2s. For example, the original input has a 2 in the fourth row, fifth column. The output's first row has a 4 in the middle. Maybe the 4 is related to the position of the 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where each cell is transformed based on the original cell's value and the distance from certain points. For example, if a cell is in a certain position relative to a 2, it's transformed into a certain value.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's look at example 2. The input has a 2 in the third row, fourth column. The output's third row has 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is in the same position. The 1s are adjacent to it. Similarly, in the fifth row of example 2, the input has a 2 in the fourth column, and the output has 1s on either side.\n\nThis suggests that 2s are kept as 2s, and their adjacent cells are transformed into 1s. But what about other numbers?\n\nLooking at example 1's input, there's a 2 in the fifth row, columns 3-5. The output's fifth row has 4, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 4, 8. So the 2s are in the middle, and the surrounding cells are 4 and 8. Maybe this is part of a pattern where the 2s are in a line, and the output is filled with numbers that depend on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where each cell is transformed based on the original cell's value and the position of the cell in the grid. For example, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1 if it's in a certain position, or 8 otherwise. But how?\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have a pattern where certain positions are filled with 1s, 4s, 8s, and 2s. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are at the corners and around the 2s. The 4s and 8s are in the middle. Maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 2s are part of a structure that creates these numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each cell is transformed based on the original cell's value and the position of the cell. For example, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1 if it's in a certain region, or 8 if in another. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where the 2s are replaced by 2s, and the surrounding cells are filled with numbers based on their distance from the 2s. For example, cells adjacent to a 2 are 1, cells two steps away are 4, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where each 0 is replaced with a number based on the number of surrounding 2s. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a grid that is a combination of the input's 2s and their positions. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is 1 if it's adjacent to a 2, and 8 otherwise. But in example 1's output, there are 4s and 8s, so this might not be the case.\n\nAnother thought: Looking at the output of example 1, the first row has 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0. The 4 is in the middle. Maybe this is part of a pattern where the 4 is generated based on the position of the 2s. For example, the 4 is at (0,4), which is the center of the first row. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a pattern where the 2s are in certain positions, and the output is a grid where the 2s are replaced by 2s, and the surrounding cells are filled with numbers based on their position relative to the 2s. For example, if a cell is in a certain position relative to a 2, it's transformed into 1, 4, or 8.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. However, given that the output for example 1 has 1s, 4s, and 8s, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with these numbers based on the input's 2s.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the output as a grid where each cell is transformed based on the original cell's value and its position. For example, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1 if it's in a certain position, or 8 otherwise. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the 0s are replaced with 1s or 8s based on their position. For example, the first row's first and last columns are 1s, and the middle is 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a grid where each cell is transformed based on the distance from the nearest 2 in the input. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 2, it becomes 1. If it's two steps away, it becomes 4, and so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where the 2s are part of a structure, and the output is a transformation that creates a pattern around them. For example, the 2s are in a line, and the output has 1s and 8s around them.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nGiven that the output is always 12x10, maybe the transformation is based on the input's structure. For example, if the input has a 2 in a certain position, the output has certain values around it.\n\nBut since the test input has a 2 in certain positions, and the output must be 12x10, perhaps the transformation is based on the input's 2s and their positions.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have 1s, 4s, and 8s in positions that are related to the input's 2s. For example, in example 1, the 2s are in certain positions, and the output has 1s around them. So maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 1s or 8s based on the proximity to 2s.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nPerhaps the transformation is as follows: For each cell in the output grid, if the original cell is 0, then the output cell is 1 if it's in a certain pattern, or 8 otherwise. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a grid where each cell is transformed based on the original cell's value. For example, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1. But in example 1's output, there are 4s and 8s, so this can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where each cell's value is determined by the original cell's value and the position. For example, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1 if the row is even, and 8 if the row is odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother thought: Looking at example 1's output, the first row has 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0. The 4 is in the middle. The fifth row of the output has 4, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 4, 8. The 4s are on the ends. Maybe this is part of a pattern where certain positions are filled with 4s and 8s based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 2s in the input are replaced by 2s, and the surrounding cells are filled with numbers based on their position. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 2, it becomes 1, and if it's two steps away, it becomes 4, and so on.\n\nBut how to implement this? For each cell in the output grid, check if it's adjacent to any 2 in the input. If yes, then output 1. Otherwise, output 8 or 4 based on some other condition.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's try to test it against the examples.\n\nIn example 1's input, the fourth row has a 2 in column 4. The output's fourth row has 1 in column 3 and 5. So adjacent cells are 1. That fits. The fifth row has 2s in columns 3-5. The output's fifth row has 4,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,4,8. So the cells adjacent to the 2s are 4 and 8. So maybe the distance from the 2s determines the output value. For example, cells at distance 1 (adjacent) are 1, distance 2 are 4, and distance 3 are 8. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where the 2s are part of a pattern, and the output is a transformation that creates a certain pattern around them. For example, the 2s are in a line, and the output has 1s and 8s around them.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know. Given that the test input has 2s in certain positions, I need to find a pattern that can handle that.\n\nAnother observation: The output for example 1 has 1s and 4s in certain positions. For example, the first row's 1s are at the ends, and the middle is 4. Maybe this is part of a pattern where the output is a grid that has 1s at the corners and 4s in the middle.\n\nBut how to relate this to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 2s are in certain positions, and the output is filled with numbers based on the distance from the nearest 2. For example, if the distance is 1, output 1; if distance is 2, output 4; if distance is 3, output 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n1. For each cell in the output grid, determine the distance to the nearest 2 in the input.\n2. Based on that distance, assign a value to the output cell.\n3. If the original cell is 2, keep it as 2.\n4. For other cells, assign values based on the distance.\n\nBut how to handle this for the test input, which has 2s in certain positions?\n\nLet's try this approach for example 1's input. The fourth row has a 2 in column 4. The distance from that 2 to the cell in (0,4) is 4 rows away. So the output cell would be 8, but in the first row, the cell (0,4) is 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is measured in a different way. For example, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1 if it's adjacent to a 2, and 8 otherwise. But in example 1's first row, the cell (0,4) is 4, which is not 1 or 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 2s are replaced by 2s, and the surrounding cells are filled with numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the first row, it's filled with 1, and if it's in the fifth row, it's filled with 4.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where the numbers are based on the original cell's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1 if row is even, 8 if odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 2s are in certain positions, and the output is filled with numbers based on the position of the 2s. For example, the 2s are in a line, and the output is filled with 1s and 8s around them.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern where the output is generated by replacing 0s with 1s or 8s based on their position relative to the 2s in the input.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the 2s are in certain positions, and the output has 1s around them. So maybe the output is generated by checking for each cell if it's adjacent to a 2. If yes, it becomes 1. Otherwise, it becomes 8. But in example 1's first row, the cell (0,4) is 4, which is not 1 or 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the 0s are replaced with 1s and 8s based on their position in the grid. For example, the first row's first and last columns are 1s, and the middle is 4. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother observation: In example 1's output, the first row has 1s at the ends, and the middle is 4. The fifth row has 4s at the ends and 8s in the middle. This suggests that the output is generated based on the row and column indices, not the input.\n\nBut this would mean that the transformation is based on the input's structure, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where the numbers are based on the position of the cell in the output grid. For example, the first row has 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0. This could be a pattern where the first and last columns are 1, and the middle is 4. But how does this relate to the input?\n\nThis is getting too vague. Given the time, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern where the output is generated by replacing 0s with 1s or 8s based on their position in the grid, and the 2s are kept as is.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of grid where the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in certain positions, and 8s otherwise. For example, in the first row, the 0s are replaced with 1s at the ends and 4 in the middle. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have a pattern where the numbers are based on the row and column indices. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 1s at (0,0) and (0,8), which are the corners. The middle is 4. This could be part of a pattern where the output is filled with 1s at the corners and 4 in the middle. But how to relate this to the input?\n\nThis is not helpful. Given the time, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLet me try to think of the transformation as follows:\n\n- For each cell in the output grid, if the original cell is 0, then the output is 1 if the cell is in a certain position, or 8 otherwise.\n- If the original cell is 2, then the output is 2.\n- For other values (like 0, 2), the output is based on the position.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are 1 or 8.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has 1s at (0,0) and (0,8). The fifth row has 4s at (4,0) and (4,8), and 8s in the middle. So maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the first and last columns are 1s, and the middle columns are 4s or 8s based on their position.\n\nBut this doesn't account for the 2s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of grid where the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the first or last column, and 8s otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can explain both examples. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s around the 2s, and in example 2, the output has 1s around the 2s as well. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if they are adjacent to 2s, and 8s otherwise. But how to handle the 4s and other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the same row or column as a 2, and 8s otherwise. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nIn the absence of a clear pattern, perhaps the best approach is to write code that replaces 0s with 1s if they are adjacent to a 2, and 8s otherwise, and leaves 2s as is. This might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nLet's try to code this:\n\nFor each cell in the output grid:\n\n- If the original cell is 2, output 2.\n- Else, check if the cell is adjacent to any 2 in the input. If yes, output 1.\n- Else, output 8.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the cell (0,4) is 4, which would not fit this pattern. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in certain positions, like the first or last column, and 8s otherwise.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the 0s are replaced with 1s if the row is even, and 8 if odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to make a best guess. Based on the examples, it seems that the 2s are kept as 2s, and the 0s are replaced with 1s or 8s based on their position relative to the 2s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother observation: In example 1's output, the first row has 1s at the ends and 4 in the middle. The fifth row has 4 at the ends and 8 in the middle. This suggests that the output is generated by a pattern where the first and last columns are 1s or 4s based on the row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a pattern where the numbers are based on the row and column indices. For example, the value is 1 if the row is even and column is 0 or 8, 4 if row is even and column is 4, and 8 otherwise.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\n- For each cell in the output grid, if the original cell is 2, output 2.\n- Otherwise, if the cell is 0, output 1 if it is in a certain position, else 8.\n- But how to determine the certain position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by a pattern where the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the first or last column, and 8 otherwise.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach and write code that replaces 0s with 1s if they are in the first or last column, and 8 otherwise, and leaves 2s as is. This might not work for all examples, but it's a start.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the first and last columns are 1s, which fits. The middle is 4, which is not 1 or 8. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have a pattern where the numbers are based on the row and column indices. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0. This could be a pattern where the value is 1 if the column is 0 or 8, 4 if column is 4, and 0 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to relate this to the input.\n\nThis is not helpful. Given the time, I think I need to proceed with the code that replaces 0s with 1s if they are adjacent to 2s, and 8 otherwise. This might not work for all cases, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new 12x10 grid\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(12)]\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                output[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                # Check if the cell is adjacent to any 2 in the input\n                adjacent = False\n                for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                        if 0 <= ni < 12 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                            if grid[ni][nj] == 2:\n                                adjacent = True\n                                break\n                    if adjacent:\n                        break\n                if adjacent:\n                    output[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    output[i][j] = 8\n    return output\n\nBut this might not work for the examples. For example, in example 1's first row, the cell (0,4) is 4, but according to this code, it would be 1 or 8. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach and see if it fits the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some other pattern. For example, the output is generated by replacing 0s with 1s if they are in the first or last column, and 8s otherwise. But this would not explain the 4s in example 1.\n\nIn the absence of a clear pattern, I think the best I can do is to write code that replaces 0s with 1s if they are adjacent to 2s, and 8s otherwise, and leaves 2s as is. This is my best guess based on the examples.\n"
