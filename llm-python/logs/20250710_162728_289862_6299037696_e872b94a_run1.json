The problem states the output must always be 4x1.\n- The example outputs shown in text are all a column of zeros, regardless of input content.\n- Visually from images: \n  - Inputs vary in size and shape, but outputs are always a single vertical line.\n  - The single column in output is black (0), no matter what the input is.\n- No obvious direct mapping from input coloring or shapes to different numeric values.\n- Possibly the transformation is trivial: always return a 4x1 grid filled with zeros (0).\n- Since the problem states to write a program that always outputs a 4x1 grid, even though examples 2 and 3 outputs do not match that dimension, the problem specifically emphasizes the output must be always 4x1.\n- From the description: \"Your transformation must always produce a 4\u00d71 output grid.\"\n- Because the example outputs in text and images are zeros columns, the simplest guess is the output is always a column of zeros with height 4.\n- The examples might have outputs whereas the original ARC task expects height matching input or similar, but the problem overrides that with a strict 4x1 output.\n\n**Hypothesis:** Output a 4x1 grid of all zeros.\n\nThis is the pattern that fits all constraints and instructions given.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The output is always a 4x1 grid filled with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0] for _ in range(4)]\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
