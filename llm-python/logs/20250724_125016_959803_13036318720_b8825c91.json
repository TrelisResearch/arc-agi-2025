In the input, these rows contain \"4 4 4 4\" patterns, and in the output, they seem to be replaced with values from other parts of the grid.\n\nExample 2: Rows 2 and 12 (0-indexed) appear to be swapped with rows 13 and 3 respectively. There's also some modification in the middle rows around rows 8-9.\n\nExample 3: Rows 6 and 9 (0-indexed) have been modified. The \"4 4 4 4\" patterns are replaced with values that seem to mirror or reference other parts of the grid.\n\nExample 4: Rows 1 and 14, and rows 2 and 13 seem to be swapped or mirrored.\n\nLooking more closely at the patterns:\n- The grids are 16x16\n- There appear to be symmetric properties\n- Certain rows with repetitive patterns (like \"4 4 4 4\") are being transformed\n- The transformations seem to involve mirroring or replacing sections with corresponding sections from symmetric positions\n\nLet me identify a more specific pattern:\nIn several examples, I notice that when there are rows with central repetitive patterns, they get replaced with values from corresponding symmetric positions in the grid.\n\nLet me implement a solution based on this observation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Grid size is 16x16\n    n = 16\n    \n    # For each row, check if it has a repetitive pattern in the middle\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Check if the row has a pattern like x x x a a a a y y y\n        # where the middle section is repetitive\n        row = grid[i]\n        \n        # Look for repetitive patterns in the middle of the row\n        # Check if positions 6-9 (indices) have the same values\n        if len(row) >= 10 and row[6] == row[7] == row[8] == row[9]:\n            # If we find such a pattern, replace it with corresponding values\n            # from the symmetric position in the grid\n            \n            # Find the symmetric row\n            sym_row_idx = n - 1 - i\n            \n            # Replace the middle section with values from the symmetric row\n            if sym_row_idx < n and sym_row_idx >= 0:\n                for j in range(6, 10):\n                    if j < len(result[i]) and j < len(grid[sym_row_idx]):\n                        result[i][j] = grid[sym_row_idx][j]\n        \n        # Also check for longer repetitive patterns\n        if len(row) >= 12:\n            # Check pattern from index 4 to 11\n            if (row[4] == row[5] == row[6] == row[7] == row[8] == row[9] == row[10] == row[11]):\n                # Replace with symmetric row values\n                sym_row_idx = n - 1 - i\n                if sym_row_idx < n and sym_row_idx >= 0:\n                    for j in range(4, 12):\n                        if j < len(result[i]) and j < len(grid[sym_row_idx]):\n                            result[i][j] = grid[sym_row_idx][j]\n    \n    # Additional check for specific pattern in examples\n    # If we have rows that are exact mirrors, sometimes they get swapped\n    for i in range(n):\n        row = grid[i]\n        sym_row_idx = n - 1 - i\n        if sym_row_idx > i and sym_row_idx < n:\n            sym_row = grid[sym_row_idx]\n            # If rows are similar, check if they should be swapped\n            # Based on having certain repetitive patterns\n            if (len(row) >= 8 and len(sym_row) >= 8 and \n                row[6] == row[7] == sym_row[6] == sym_row[7]):\n                # Check if middle section is repetitive\n                if (len(row) >= 10 and \n                    row[6] == row[7] == row[8] == row[9]):\n                    # Swap the rows\n                    result[i] = grid[sym_row_idx][:]\n                    result[sym_row_idx] = grid[i][:]\n    \n    return result\n```",

Some internal changes occur, particularly in rows 5-10, columns 5-10 area.\n\nExample 2: Again, the outer rows/columns unchanged. Changes appear to be symmetric in the middle regions.\n\nExample 3: Outer rows/columns unchanged. Changes in the central area show some symmetry.\n\nExample 4: Outer rows/columns unchanged. Central area shows symmetric transformations.\n\nLooking more closely at the changes:\n- In Example 1: Rows 5 and 10, columns 5 and 10 seem to be modified symmetrically\n- In Example 2: Rows 2,3 and 12,13; columns 2,3 and 12,13 are swapped\n- In Example 3: Rows 6,7 and 9,10; columns 6,7 and 9,10 show symmetric changes\n- In Example 4: Rows 1,2 and 13,14; columns 1,2 and 13,14 are swapped\n\nThe pattern seems to involve:\n1. Keeping the outermost rows and columns unchanged\n2. Performing some symmetric transformation on the inner regions\n3. Often involving swapping or mirroring of rectangular regions\n\nLet me look for a more specific pattern. It seems like there's often a 2x2 or larger block swapping or reflection happening in the center area.\n\nLooking at Example 4 more carefully:\n- Rows 1-2 and 13-14 appear to be swapped with each other\n- Columns 1-2 and 13-14 appear to be swapped with each other\n\nThis suggests a pattern where:\n1. The border (first and last rows/columns) remains unchanged\n2. Some inner rectangular regions are swapped or mirrored\n\nLet me implement a solution that attempts to identify and apply such transformations:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Keep the outermost rows and columns unchanged (as observed in all examples)\n    # Only transform the inner 14x14 region (indices 1 to 14)\n    \n    # Based on the pattern analysis, it looks like there are symmetric swaps\n    # Let's try swapping symmetric rows/columns in the middle region\n    \n    # For the inner region, try swapping symmetric positions\n    for i in range(1, 8):  # Rows 1-7\n        for j in range(1, 15):  # All inner columns\n            # Swap row i with row (15-i) for the inner region\n            result[i][j], result[15-i][j] = grid[15-i][j], grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Also swap columns symmetrically\n    for i in range(1, 15):  # All inner rows\n        for j in range(1, 8):  # Columns 1-7\n            # Swap column j with column (15-j)\n            result[i][j], result[i][15-j] = result[i][15-j], result[i][j]\n    \n    # This double swap might cancel out, so let's try a more direct approach\n    # Based on examples, let's try swapping specific symmetric blocks\n    \n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]  # Reset\n    \n    # Try swapping the corners of the inner 14x14 grid\n    # Top-left with bottom-right, top-right with bottom-left\n    size = 16\n    margin = 1  # Leave 1 row/column on each side\n    \n    # Define the four corner regions\n    for i in range(margin, size-margin):\n        for j in range(margin, size-margin):\n            # Apply a symmetric transformation\n            result[i][j] = grid[size-1-i][size-1-j]\n    \n    return result\n```",

Specifically, rows 6-11, columns 6-11 seem to have some transformation.\n\nExample 2: Similar pattern - outer areas mostly unchanged, inner areas modified.\n\nExample 3: Again, outer frame preserved, inner content transformed.\n\nExample 4: Same structure - border preserved, inner area changed.\n\nLooking more closely at the changes:\n- The transformation seems to affect a central region\n- The border/frame of the grid remains intact\n- There appears to be some kind of symmetry or mirroring happening in the central area\n\nLet me check for specific patterns:\n- In Example 1: Rows 6,7,8,9 (0-indexed as 5,6,7,8) seem to have diagonal symmetry applied\n- In Example 4: Similar pattern in the central area\n\nIt looks like the transformation involves:\n1. Keeping the outer frame (first/last few rows/columns) unchanged\n2. Applying some symmetric transformation to the central region\n3. Possibly reflecting or mirroring parts of the central area\n\nLet me look at Example 1 more carefully:\n- Input and output grids are 16x16\n- The outer 5 rows/columns on each side seem mostly unchanged\n- The central 6x6 area (rows 5-10, cols 5-10) has changes\n- Specifically, it looks like the central area might be getting symmetric treatment\n\nActually, looking even more carefully:\nIn Example 1, comparing rows 5-10 with rows 10-5 (reversed), there's a pattern.\nRow 5 becomes similar to what Row 10 was, with some modifications.\n\nLet me check if it's about making the grid symmetric along the horizontal or vertical axis.\n\nLooking at Example 4:\nRow 1 (index 1) becomes like the original row 14 (index 14)\nRow 2 (index 2) becomes like the original row 13 (index 13)\nAnd so on...\n\nActually, let me re-examine Example 1:\n- Row 5 becomes like original row 10 but with some specific changes\n- Row 6 becomes like original row 9\n- Row 7 stays the same as row 7\n- Row 8 stays the same as row 8\n- Row 9 becomes like original row 6\n- Row 10 becomes like original row 5\n\nWait, that's not quite right. Let me look at specific values.\n\nIn Example 1, looking at positions [5][10] to [5][15]:\nOriginal: 4 4 4 4 1 6\nResult:   3 8 9 7 1 6\n\nAnd at positions [10][5] to [10][10]:\nOriginal: 4 4 4 7 1 6  \nResult:   3 8 9 7 1 6\n\nSo [10][5:11] in result = [10][5:11] in original\nBut [5][10:16] in result = something else...\n\nLet me approach this differently. Let me check if there's a pattern of copying certain regions.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again:\nPosition [5][10], [5][11], [5][12], [5][13] change from 4,4,4,4 to 3,8,9,7\nPosition [5][14], [5][15] stay 1,6\n\nThis looks like the transformation copies part of a different row/column to another location.\n\nActually, let me look at this as: the transformation makes the grid have a certain symmetry by copying/modifying the central area.\n\nAfter careful examination, it seems the pattern involves:\n1. Keeping a border unchanged\n2. Making the central region symmetric, possibly by copying from one triangular portion to another\n\nBased on the examples, it looks like the transformation creates mirror symmetry across both diagonals or makes the grid centrosymmetric in the central region.\n\nLet me implement a solution that attempts to create symmetry in the central area:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    result = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Define the central region boundaries\n    # Based on examples, it seems to be rows/cols 5-10 (6x6 center)\n    start_idx = 5\n    end_idx = 10\n    \n    # Make the central region symmetric by averaging symmetric positions\n    # This creates a centrosymmetric pattern\n    for i in range(start_idx, end_idx + 1):\n        for j in range(start_idx, end_idx + 1):\n            # Mirror across the center point (7.5, 7.5)\n            mirror_i = 15 - i\n            mirror_j = 15 - j\n            \n            # Take the value from one of the symmetric positions\n            # Based on examples, it seems to take from the lower/right part\n            if i <= mirror_i and j <= mirror_j:\n                # Keep this value, change the mirror position\n                result[mirror_i, mirror_j] = result[i, j]\n            elif i > mirror_i or j > mirror_j:\n                # This position should take value from its mirror\n                result[i, j] = result[mirror_i, mirror_j]\n    \n    return result.tolist()\n```",

The pattern seems to be that the last 4 digits in the middle section are replaced.\n\nExample 3: Rows 7 and 10 are changed. Again, it looks like some central elements are being modified.\n\nExample 4: Rows 2, 3, 14, and 15 are changed, showing a symmetric pattern.\n\nLooking more closely, I notice:\n1. The grids are 16x16\n2. The transformation seems to affect specific rows\n3. There's often symmetry - if row X is changed, then its symmetric counterpart (15-X) might also be changed\n4. The changes seem to involve replacing certain patterns in the middle sections of rows\n\nLet me look for a more specific pattern:\n- In many cases, it appears that sequences of repeated numbers (like `4 4 4 4`) are being replaced\n- The replacement seems to follow some rule based on the surrounding numbers\n\nLooking more systematically:\nIn Example 1: Row 6 has `1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1` and becomes `1 1 1 1 3 8 9 7 1`\nIn Example 4: Row 2 has `1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1` and becomes `1 1 1 1 5 9 2 6 1`\n\nIt seems like the middle repeated sequence (`4 4 4 4`) is being replaced by a pattern derived from the outer context.\n\nLet me try to identify the rule:\n- It looks like in a pattern like `A B B B B A`, the inner `B B B B` gets replaced by something\n- The replacement might be based on the values at the edges or some symmetric property\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the symmetric nature:\n\nIn Example 1:\nRow 6: `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 6`\nRow 11: `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 7 1 6`\n\nThese rows are symmetric around the center.

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify the transformation pattern.\n\nLet me examine each example carefully:\n\nExample 1: Looking at the differences between input and output, I can see that rows 6 and 11 have changes. Row 6 changes from `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 6` to `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 3 8 9 7 1 6`, and row 11 changes from `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 7 1 6` to `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 3 8 9 7 1 6`. The pattern seems to be replacing the repeated 4s with a mirrored pattern.\n\nExample 2: Rows 3 and 13 are changed. Row 3 changes from `6 4 4 2 6 6 8 8 8 8 6 6 2 5 1 6` to `6 1 5 2 6 6 8 8 8 8 6 6 2 5 1 6`, and row 13 changes from `6 1 5 2 6 6 8 8 8 8 6 6 2 5 1 6` to `6 1 5 2 6 6 8 8 8 8 6 6 2 5 1 6`. Row 14 also changes from `6 1 5 2 6 6 8 8 8 8 6 6 2 5 1 6` to `6 1 5 2 6 6 8 8 8 8 6 6 2 5 1 6`. This is more complex.\n\nExample 3: Rows 7 and 10 are changed. The pattern involves replacing repeated 4s with other values in a symmetric way.\n\nExample 4: Rows 2 and 15 are changed, and rows 3 and 14, rows 4 and 13. The pattern seems to involve mirroring or symmetric replacement.\n\nLooking more carefully, I notice that in several cases, there are blocks of repeated digits (like 4s) that get replaced with a more complex pattern, often involving mirroring.\n\nLet me look for a more specific pattern:\n- It seems to affect rows that have long sequences of the same digit\n- The transformation often creates a more symmetric or palindromic pattern\n- Sometimes it involves replacing central repeated sequences with mirrored patterns from the edges\n\nLet me try to identify a clearer pattern. Looking at example 1 again:\nRow 6: `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 6` \u2192 `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 3 8 9 7 1 6`\nThe last part `4 4 4 4 1 6` becomes `3 8 9 7 1 6`, which is like taking `1 6` and prepending the reverse of the first part excluding the repeated section.\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. It seems like the transformation is about creating symmetry. Let me check if it's mirroring the grid or parts of it.\n\nLooking at example 4:\nRow 2: `2 1 6 2 9 5 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 2` \u2192 `2 1 6 2 9 5 1 1 1 1 5 9 2 6 1 2`\nThe last 6 elements `1 1 4 4 4 4 1 2` become `1 1 5 9 2 6 1 2` where `5 9 2 6 1 2` is like a transformation of `9 5 1 1 1 2`.\n\nThis is complex. Let me look for a simpler pattern - maybe it's just mirroring certain rows.\n\nActually, let me re-examine example 1 more carefully:\nComparing input and output row by row:\n- Rows 1,2,3,4,5 are unchanged\n- Row 6 changes\n- Rows 7,8,9,10 are unchanged  \n- Row 11 changes\n- Rows 12,13,14,15,16 are unchanged\n\nSo rows 6 and 11 are transformed. What's special about these rows?\nRow 6: `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 6`\nRow 11: `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 7 1 6`\n\nBoth have long sequences of repeated digits (1s and 4s). \n\nLooking at the output:\nRow 6: `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 3 8 9 7 1 6` \nRow 11: `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 3 8 9 7 1 6`\n\nIt looks like the second half is replaced with the reverse of the first half (excluding the repeated middle parts).\n\nLet me try to formalize this:\n1. Find rows with long repeated sequences\n2. Replace the second half with a transformation of the first half\n\nBut this is still not clear. Let me try another approach - maybe it's about fixing asymmetries in specific rows.\n\nLooking at the positions where changes occur, they seem to be symmetric about the center. Let me check if it's about making the entire grid symmetric.\n\nActually, let me look at it as replacing repeated digit sequences in the center with mirrored patterns from the edges.\n\nFor row 6 in example 1:\nOriginal: `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 6`\nResult:   `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 3 8 9 7 1 6`\n\nThe first 10 elements are `6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1`\nThe last 6 elements change from `4 4 4 4 1 6` to `3 8 9 7 1 6`\nNotice that `3 8 9 7 1 6` is the reverse of the first 6 elements `6 1 7 9 8 3` of the first 10.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n1. Identify rows with central repeated sequences\n2. Replace the latter part with the reverse of an appropriate prefix\n\nLet me implement this hypothesis:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Process each row\n    for i in range(len(result)):\n        row = result[i]\n        # Look for rows with repeated sequences in the middle\n        # Check if there's a pattern of repeated digits that might need transformation\n        \n        # Find if there are long sequences of repeated digits\n        # Simple approach: look for rows where transformation might be needed\n        # based on having repeated patterns\n        \n        # For this pattern, I'll look for symmetric replacement\n        # where the second half is replaced with reverse of first half\n        \n        # A simple heuristic: if the row has repeated digits in middle,\n        # replace second half with reverse of first half\n        n = len(row)\n        if n == 16:  # Only process 16x16 grids\n            # Check for pattern of repeated digits in center\n            # Look for long runs of same digit\n            for start in range(4, 10):\n                for end in range(start+2, 13):\n                    # Check if row[start:end+1] are all the same\n                    if all(row[j] == row[start] for j in range(start, end+1)) and (end - start + 1) >= 4:\n                        # Found a long repeated sequence\n                        # Replace second half with reverse of first half\n                        midpoint = n // 2\n                        # Replace second half with reverse of first half\n                        for j in range(midpoint, n):\n                            result[i][j] = row[n-1-j]\n                        break\n                else:\n                    continue\n                break\n    \n    return result\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify the transformation pattern.\n\nLet me examine each example carefully:\n\nExample 1: Looking at the input and output, I notice that rows 6 and 11 (0-indexed as 5 and 10) have been modified. The central 4x4 region in these rows appears to have been replaced.\n\nExample 2: Rows 2 and 12 (indices 2 and 12) and rows 4 and 10 (indices 4 and 10) seem to have been modified, with central regions being replaced.\n\nExample 3: Rows 6 and 9 (indices 6 and 9) have been modified - the central portions have been replaced.\n\nExample 4: Rows 1 and 14 (indices 1 and 14) and rows 2 and 13 (indices 2 and 13) have been modified.\n\nLooking more closely, it seems like there's a pattern of symmetry - certain rows are being modified to create or maintain symmetry in the grid. The modifications typically involve replacing the central portion of rows with values from corresponding symmetric rows.\n\nLet me identify the specific pattern:\n- It appears that for certain pairs of symmetric rows (like row i and row 15-i in a 16x16 grid), the central elements of one row are replaced with values from the corresponding positions in its symmetric counterpart.\n- The central region seems to be columns 6-9 (indices) or a similar middle section.\n\nLooking more carefully:\nIn Example 1: Rows 5 and 10 - the middle 4 elements (columns 6-9) of row 5 are replaced with the middle 4 elements of row 10, and vice versa.\n\nIn Example 2: Rows 2 and 13 are swapped in the middle, as are rows 4 and 11.\n\nIn Example 3: Rows 6 and 9 are swapped in the middle section.\n\nIn Example 4: Rows 1 and 14 are swapped in the middle, as are rows 2 and 13.\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Identify symmetric row pairs (row i and row 15-i)\n2. For certain pairs, swap the central 4 elements (columns 6,7,8,9 or similar)\n3. The selection of which pairs to swap follows some rule\n\nLet me check if it's always the pairs that have some specific property...\n\nActually, looking more systematically:\n- Example 1: Swapped rows (5,10) - these are not symmetric pairs, they're at indices 5 and 10\n- Example 2: Swapped rows (2,13) and (4,11) - also not symmetric pairs\n- Example 3: Swapped rows (6,9) - not symmetric\n- Example 4: Swapped rows (1,14) and (2,13) - not symmetric\n\nLet me recheck what \"symmetric\" means. In a 16x16 grid, row i is symmetric to row (15-i).\n- Row 0 \u2194 Row 15\n- Row 1 \u2194 Row 14\n- Row 2 \u2194 Row 13\n- etc.\n\nSo:\n- Example 1: Rows 5 and 10 are NOT symmetric (5\u219410 would mean 5\u219410, but 5\u219410 because 15-5=10)\n- Wait, 15-5=10, so rows 5 and 10 ARE symmetric!\n- Example 2: Rows 2 and 13 are symmetric (15-2=13) \u2713\n- Example 3: Rows 6 and 9 are symmetric (15-6=9) \u2713\n- Example 4: Rows 1 and 14 are symmetric (15-1=14) \u2713, and rows 2 and 13 are symmetric \u2713\n\nSo the pattern is:\n1. Identify symmetric row pairs\n2. For certain symmetric pairs, swap the central 4 columns (6,7,8,9)\n\nNow I need to figure out which pairs get swapped. Let me look at the content:\nIt seems like pairs where the rows have some similarity or specific pattern get swapped.\n\nLooking at the actual changes:\nIn Example 1: The central 4 elements of rows 5 and 10 are swapped.\nIn Example 2: The central 4 elements of rows 2,4 and their symmetric counterparts 13,11 are swapped.\nIn Example 3: The central 4 elements of rows 6 and 9 are swapped.\nIn Example 4: The central 4 elements of rows 1,2 and their symmetric counterparts 14,13 are swapped.\n\nThe selection seems to be that the first few symmetric pairs from the outside in get swapped. Let me check:\nExample 1: First pair from outside (rows 0,15) - not swapped. Second pair (rows 1,14) - not swapped. Third pair (rows 2,13) - not swapped. Fourth pair (rows 3,12) - not swapped. Fifth pair (rows 4,11) - not swapped. Sixth pair (rows 5,10) - swapped.\nThis doesn't seem consistent.\n\nLet me look at what makes a pair get swapped:\nMaybe it's based on the content of the rows?\n\nActually, looking more carefully at Example 1:\nRow 5: 6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 6\nRow 10: 6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 7 1 6\n\nRow 5 has \"4 4 4 4\" at positions 10-13 (0-indexed)\nRow 10 has \"4 4 4 7\" at positions 10-13 (0-indexed)\n\nThe output has:\nRow 5: 6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 3 8 9 7 1 6  (the \"4 4 4 4\" is replaced with \"3 8 9 7\")\nRow 10: 6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 3 8 9 7 1 6 (the \"4 4 4 7\" is replaced with \"3 8 9 7\")\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me reread the output carefully.\n\nLooking at row 5 (index 5):\nInput:  6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 1 6\nOutput: 6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 3 8 9 7 1 6\n\nSo columns 10,11,12,13 (0-indexed) changed from 4,4,4,4 to 3,8,9,7\n\nLooking at row 10 (index 10):\nInput:  6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 7 1 6  \nOutput: 6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 3 8 9 7 1 6\n\nSame change! Both rows got the same replacement.\n\nWhere did 3,8,9,7 come from? Let me check the symmetric rows.\n\nRow 5's symmetric row is row 10. Row 10's symmetric row is row 5.\nSo the pattern might be: for symmetric row pairs, we replace the central elements of each row with the central elements from the OTHER row in the pair.\n\nLet me verify:\nExample 1: Rows 5 and 10\n- Row 5 center (cols 10-13): 4 4 4 4 \u2192 replaced with row 10 center: 4 4 4 7... No, that's not it.\n\nWait, let me be more careful. In Example 1, what are the actual center values?\n\nRow 5 center (cols 6,7,8,9): 1 1 1 1\nRow 10 center (cols 6,7,8,9): 1 1 1 1\n\nThat's the same. Let me look at different center columns.\n\nActually, looking at the output again:\nRow 5: 6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 3 8 9 7 1 6\nThe changed part seems to be columns 10-13: 4 4 4 4 \u2192 3 8 9 7\n\nRow 10: 6 1 7 9 8 3 1 1 1 1 3 8 9 7 1 6\nColumns 10-13: 4 4 4 7 \u2192 3 8 9",

The \"4 4 4 4\" patterns are replaced with values that seem to mirror or reference other parts of the grid.\n\nExample 4: Rows 1 and 14, and rows 2 and 13 seem to be swapped or mirrored.\n\nLooking more closely at the patterns:\n- The grids are 16x16\n- There appear to be symmetric properties\n- Certain rows with repetitive patterns (like \"4 4 4 4\") are being transformed\n- The transformations seem to involve mirroring or replacing sections with corresponding sections from symmetric positions\n\nLet me identify a more specific pattern:\nIn several examples, I notice that when there are rows with central repetitive patterns, they get replaced with values from corresponding symmetric positions in the grid.\n\nLet me implement a solution based on this observation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Grid size is 16x16\n    n = 16\n    \n    # For each row, check if it has a repetitive pattern in the middle\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Check if the row has a pattern like x x x a a a a y y y\n        # where the middle section is repetitive\n        row = grid[i]\n        \n        # Look for repetitive patterns in the middle of the row\n        # Check if positions 6-9 (indices) have the same values\n        if len(row) >= 10 and row[6] == row[7] == row[8] == row[9]:\n            # If we find such a pattern, replace it with corresponding values\n            # from the symmetric position in the grid\n            \n            # Find the symmetric row\n            sym_row_idx = n - 1 - i\n            \n            # Replace the middle section with values from the symmetric row\n            if sym_row_idx < n and sym_row_idx >= 0:\n                for j in range(6, 10):\n                    if j < len(result[i]) and j < len(grid[sym_row_idx]):\n                        result[i][j] = grid[sym_row_idx][j]\n        \n        # Also check for longer repetitive patterns\n        if len(row) >= 12:\n            # Check pattern from index 4 to 11\n            if (row[4] == row[5] == row[6] == row[7] == row[8] == row[9] == row[10] == row[11]):\n                # Replace with symmetric row values\n                sym_row_idx = n - 1 - i\n                if sym_row_idx < n and sym_row_idx >= 0:\n                    for j in range(4, 12):\n                        if j < len(result[i]) and j < len(grid[sym_row_idx]):\n                            result[i][j] = grid[sym_row_idx][j]\n    \n    # Additional check for specific pattern in examples\n    # If we have rows that are exact mirrors, sometimes they get swapped\n    for i in range(n):\n        row = grid[i]\n        sym_row_idx = n - 1 - i\n        if sym_row_idx > i and sym_row_idx < n:\n            sym_row = grid[sym_row_idx]\n            # If rows are similar, check if they should be swapped\n            # Based on having certain repetitive patterns\n            if (len(row) >= 8 and len(sym_row) >= 8 and \n                row[6] == row[7] == sym_row[6] == sym_row[7]):\n                # Check if middle section is repetitive\n                if (len(row) >= 10 and \n                    row[6] == row[7] == row[8] == row[9]):\n                    # Swap the rows\n                    result[i] = grid[sym_row_idx][:]\n                    result[sym_row_idx] = grid[i][:]\n    \n    return result\n```",
