Numbers greater than 0 seem to be \"expanded\" into a region of 5s around them\n2. The expansion seems to be in all directions (horizontal and vertical)\n3. The expansion forms a \"blob\" or \"spread\" of 5s around the original number\n4. The size of the expansion seems to be consistent, with the 5s spreading out from the original number\n\nBased on this pattern, I'll create a function that:\n- For each cell with a value greater than 0, spread 5s in all directions until the edge of the grid or until a non-zero cell is encountered\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] > 0:\n                # Spread 5s in all directions\n                # Left\n                for k in range(j-1, -1, -1):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = 5\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Right\n                for k in range(j+1, 13):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = 5\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Up\n                for k in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = 5\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Down\n                for k in range(i+1, 13):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = 5\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] > 0:\n                # Spread 5s in all directions\n                # Left\n                for k in range(j-1, -1, -1):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = 5\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Right\n                for k in range(j+1, 13):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = 5\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Up\n                for k in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = 5\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Down\n                for k in range(i+1, 13):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = 5\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
