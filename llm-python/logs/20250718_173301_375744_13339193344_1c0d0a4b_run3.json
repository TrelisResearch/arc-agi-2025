The patterns seem to be related to the arrangement and spacing of '8's in the input grid.\n\nFrom the examples, it appears that:\n1. '8's that are in a certain pattern (like a cluster or specific arrangement) are replaced with '2's\n2. The replacement seems to follow a specific spatial pattern, not just a simple value substitution\n3. The output grid is always 5x13, so the transformation must ensure this output size\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain patterns of '8's with '2's in a specific way.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the pattern to look for (a cluster of 8s in a specific shape)\n    # This is a simple pattern that matches some of the examples\n    pattern = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n        [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n        [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Search for the pattern in the grid\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(13):\n            # Check if the pattern starts at (i,j)\n            match = True\n            for x in range(5):\n                for y in range(13):\n                    if grid[i+x][j+y] != 8 and pattern[x][y] != 0:\n                        match = False\n                        break\n                if not match:\n                    break\n            if match:\n                # Replace the pattern with 2s\n                for x in range(5):\n                    for y in range(13):\n                        transformed_grid[i+x][j+y] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

'8's that are in a certain pattern (like a cluster or specific arrangement) are replaced with '2's\n2. The replacement seems to follow a specific spatial pattern, not just a simple value substitution\n3. The output grid is always 5x13, so the transformation must ensure this output size\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain patterns of '8's with '2's in a specific way.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the pattern to look for (a cluster of 8s in a specific shape)\n    # This is a simple pattern that matches some of the examples\n    pattern = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n        [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n        [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Search for the pattern in the grid\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(13):\n            # Check if the pattern starts at (i,j)\n            match = True\n            for x in range(5):\n                for y in range(13):\n                    if grid[i+x][j+y] != 8 and pattern[x][y] != 0:\n                        match = False\n                        break\n                if not match:\n                    break\n            if match:\n                # Replace the pattern with 2s\n                for x in range(5):\n                    for y in range(13):\n                        transformed_grid[i+x][j+y] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
