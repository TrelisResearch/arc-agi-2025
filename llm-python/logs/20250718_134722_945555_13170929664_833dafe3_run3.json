          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. Let me look at Example 1 first. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid. Wait, but the problem says that the output must always be 6x6. So the input is probably a smaller grid, and the output is a larger grid generated from it. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\nRow 0: 3 0 0\nRow 1: 3 4 0\nRow 2: 3 4 2\n\nThe output is a 6x6 grid. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in how the input is expanded. Maybe each cell in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output? Because 3x3 input would become 6x6 if each cell is replaced by 2x2. Let me check.\n\nFor example, the first row of the input is 3, 0, 0. If each of these is expanded into a 2x2 block, then the first two rows of the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 3 4 2 (but that's the first row of output)\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. The output for example 1 is:\n\nFirst line of output: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nSecond line: 0 4 3 3 4 0\nThird: 0 0 3 3 0 0\nFourth: 0 0 3 3 0 0\nFifth: 0 4 3 3 4 0\nSixth: 2 4 3 3 4 2\n\nHmm. Let me see if there's a pattern. The input is 3x3. The output is 6x6. So perhaps each input cell is transformed into a 2x2 block. Let's see for the first input cell (3,0,0). The first row of the output starts with 2,4,3... Maybe the input cell is being mapped to a 2x2 block where the values are arranged in some way. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input grid is mirrored or rotated. For example, the input's first row is 3 0 0. The output's first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. Wait, that seems like a pattern. Let me check the output rows. The first row of output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The third is 0 0 3 3 0 0. Fourth same as third. Fifth same as second. Sixth same as first. So the output seems to have some symmetry. Maybe the input is being used to generate a pattern that's mirrored or repeated.\n\nWait, the input is 3x3. The output is 6x6. Maybe the input is being expanded into a 2x2 block for each cell. Let's think of each cell in the input as being transformed into a 2x2 block. For example, the first cell (3) in the input's first row might be transformed into a 2x2 block that's 2 4 3 3 4 2? No, that's a 6x6. Wait, perhaps each cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, but the entire input grid is arranged in a way that when expanded, the output is 6x6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is determined by some function of the input. For example, the input's first row is 3,0,0. The output's first row is 2,4,3,3,4,2. Maybe the first row of the output is a combination of the first row of the input and some other rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. Third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0. Fourth same as third. Fifth same as second. Sixth same as first. So the output has a pattern where the first two rows are mirrored, then the next two rows are zeroed, then the same as the second two rows. Maybe the input is used to generate a pattern that's repeated in the output.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 3 0 0\nRow 1: 3 4 0\nRow 2: 3 4 2\n\nIf I think of the output as being generated by some transformation that uses the input's values in a certain way. For example, maybe the output is generated by taking each cell in the input and expanding it into a 2x2 block, but with some pattern. For example, the first cell (3) in the input might be transformed into a 2x2 block that's 2 4 3 3 4 2? Wait, that's not 2x2. Maybe each cell is transformed into a 2x2 block, but the entire input is arranged in a way that when expanded, the output is 6x6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 2x2 grid for each cell, then arranging them in a way that forms the 6x6 grid. For example, the input is 3x3, so each cell is in a 2x2 block, and the total would be 6x6. Let me think: 3 rows in input, each row has 3 cells. Each cell is expanded into 2 rows and 2 columns, so total rows would be 3*2=6, columns 3*2=6. That makes sense.\n\nSo for each cell in the input grid, we create a 2x2 block in the output. But how are the values in the 2x2 block determined?\n\nLooking at the first cell of the input (row 0, column 0) which is 3. The corresponding 2x2 block in the output would be the first two rows and first two columns of the output. But looking at the output's first two rows:\n\nFirst row: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nSecond row: 0 4 3 3 4 0\n\nWait, the first two rows of the output are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nRow 1: 0 4 3 3 4 0\n\nBut if each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, then the first cell (3) would be in the top-left 2x2 block. But the first two rows of the output's first two columns are:\n\n2, 4\n0, 4\n\nWhich is a 2x2 block. But how does that relate to the input's value 3? Maybe the value is used to generate the 2x2 block. For example, maybe the value is used as the center of the block. Or perhaps the value is used in some way to generate the block's values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2x2 block is determined by the input cell's value. For example, if the input cell is 3, then the 2x2 block is:\n\n2 4\n4 2\n\nBut that would be a 2x2 block. Then, the first cell's 2x2 block would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 4 2\n\nBut looking at the first two rows of the output, the first two columns are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 0 4 \n\nHmm, that doesn't match. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0. Fourth same as third. Fifth same as second. Sixth same as first.\n\nSo the output seems to have a pattern where the first two rows are mirrored, then the next two rows are zeros, then mirrored again. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the first row is 3 0 0. The second row is 3 4 0. Third is 3 4 2. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows and columns and expanding them into a 2x2 block. For example, the first row of the input is 3, 0, 0. So each of these three cells is expanded into a 2x2 block. The first cell (3) would be in the first 2x2 block of the output, the second cell (0) in the next 2x2 block, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input grid and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell in the input is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output. For example, for each cell (i,j) in the input, the corresponding 2x2 block in the output would be at positions (2i, 2j) to (2i+1, 2j+1). Then, the values in the 2x2 block are determined by some function of the input cell's value.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at the first input cell (3) in (0,0). The corresponding 2x2 block in the output would be rows 0-1, columns 0-1. The values in that block are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 0 4 \n\nBut how does 3 relate to these numbers? Maybe the value is used to generate the numbers in the block. For example, maybe the block is filled with numbers that are derived from the input value. For instance, if the input value is 3, then the block is 2,4, 0,4. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with numbers that are based on the input value and some other pattern. For example, the first row of the block is 2 and 4, then the second row is 0 and 4. But I don't see a direct connection.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0. Fourth same as third. Fifth same as second. Sixth same as first.\n\nSo the output has a pattern where the first two rows are mirrored, then the next two rows are zeroed, then mirrored again. But how does that relate to the input? The input's first row is 3 0 0. The second row is 3 4 0. Third row is 3 4 2.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each row of the output is a combination of the input's rows and columns. For example, the first two rows of the output are generated from the first row of the input, and the next two rows from the second row of the input, etc. But that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 6x6 grid that is a combination of the input's rows and columns in some way. For example, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The input's first row is 3 0 0. Maybe the output is generated by some transformation that uses the input's values and their positions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2. The input is a 4x4 grid, and the output is an 8x8 grid. Wait, but the problem says the output must be 6x6. Wait, the example 2's input is 4 rows and 4 columns. The output is 8 rows and 8 columns? But the problem says that the output must be 6x6. Wait, no, the problem says that the output must be 6x6. But the examples given may have different input and output sizes. Wait, the first example's input is 3x3 and output is 6x6. The second example's input is 4x4 and output is 8x8? But that's not possible. Wait, looking at example 2:\n\nInput is 4 rows (each with 4 elements), and the output is 8 rows (each with 8 elements). But the problem says that the output must be 6x6. So maybe the examples are not following that, but the test input is 8x8? Wait, the test input is given as 8 rows with 8 elements each. But according to the problem, the output must be 6x6. So perhaps the examples are not following that, but the test input is 8x8. But the problem says that the output must be 6x6. So maybe the examples are not correct. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the problem says that the output must be 6x6. So the test input is 8x8, but the output must be 6x6. So the examples given in the problem are not the same as the test input. So the user is providing training examples where the input is of varying sizes, but the output is always 6x6. So the input can be of any size, but the output must be 6x6. So the function must take an input grid of any size and produce a 6x6 output grid.\n\nBut how? How to map a general input grid to a 6x6 output grid? That's the challenge.\n\nLooking back at example 1, the input is 3x3. The output is 6x6. So perhaps the input is used to generate a 6x6 grid by some transformation. Maybe the input is used as a pattern that is expanded into the 6x6 grid. For example, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid that is generated by some pattern based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain way. For example, if the input is a 3x3 grid, then each cell is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output. So the output is 6x6, which is 3*2 x 3*2.\n\nBut how to determine the values in the 2x2 blocks?\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first two rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nRow 1: 0 4 3 3 4 0\n\nIf the input's first row is 3 0 0, then each of these three cells would be expanded into 2x2 blocks. For example, the first cell (3) would generate a 2x2 block. Let's look at the first two columns of the output's first two rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 0 4 \n\nThis seems to be a 2x2 block. How does this relate to the input's value 3? Maybe the block is filled with numbers that are derived from the input's value and some other pattern. For example, the first row of the block is 2 and 4, the second row is 0 and 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2x2 block is determined by the input's cell's value and its position. For example, the first row of the block is 2 and 4, which could be derived from the input's value 3. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's input:\n\nInput rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 6 0 0\nRow 1: 4 6 0 3\nRow 2: 4 6 3 0\nRow 3: 4 3 3 0\n\nThe output is an 8x8 grid. Wait, but according to the problem, the output must be 6x6. So perhaps the examples are not correct. Or perhaps the examples are not following the same pattern. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some other pattern. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid that is generated by some transformation based on the input's rows and columns. For example, the input is used to generate a grid where certain positions are filled based on the input's values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain way. For example, the input's cell is used to determine the value in the output's cell. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0. Fourth same as third. Fifth same as second. Sixth same as first. So the output has a pattern where the first two rows are mirrored, then the next two rows are zeroed, then mirrored again. Maybe the input is used to determine the values in these rows. For example, the first row of the input is 3 0 0. The first two rows of the output are 2 4 3 3 4 2 and 0 4 3 3 4 0. Maybe the first row of the input is used to generate the first two rows of the output, and the second row of the input is used to generate the next two rows, and the third row of the input is used for the last two rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows and columns and using them to create a pattern that is mirrored or repeated. For example, the first row of the output is a combination of the input's first row and some other values.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output for example 1. The output has a pattern where the first two rows are mirrored, then the next two are zeroed, then mirrored again. The values in the first two rows are 2,4,3,3,4,2 and 0,4,3,3,4,0. The third and fourth rows are zeros except for the middle part. The fifth and sixth rows are the same as the second and first rows.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the first row is 3 0 0. The second row is 3 4 0. The third is 3 4 2. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that is a combination of the input's values and some pattern based on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell's value is determined by the input's cell in a certain way. For example, the output's cell at (i,j) is determined by the input's cell at (i//2, j//2). But this would be for a 3x3 input. Let's see.\n\nFor example, the output's first row (i=0) would be determined by input's (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). But how? For the first two columns of the output's first row, the values are 2 and 4. If the input's (0,0) is 3, then perhaps 2 and 4 are derived from that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of expansion where the input's values are used to create a pattern. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled based on the input's cell in a certain way. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell at (i//2, j//2), but with some transformation.\n\nBut how to determine the transformation? For example, in example 1, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The input's first row is 3 0 0. So for the first two columns of the output's first row, the values are 2 and 4. Maybe these are derived from the input's cell (0,0) and (0,1). For example, the first cell (0,0) is 3, and the first two values are 2 and 4. Maybe the first row of the output's first 2x2 block is [2,4], and the second row is [0,4]. Then, the next 2x2 block is [3,3], [3,4], etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the first two rows of the output are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nRow 1: 0 4 3 3 4 0\n\nThis looks like the first two rows are a combination of the input's first row and the second row. For example, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The input's first row is 3 0 0. The second row of the input is 3 4 0. Maybe the first two rows of the output are generated by some transformation of the input's first two rows. For example, the first row of the output is derived from the input's first row and the second row.\n\nBut I'm not seeing the exact pattern. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows and columns and creating a pattern where the output is a combination of the input's values in a certain way. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid that is a combination of the input's values and their positions.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled based on the input's cell in a certain way. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i//2, j//2). But then, how to determine the value?\n\nIn example 1, the output's first cell (0,0) is 2. The input's cell (0,0) is 3. So 2 is derived from 3. Maybe there's a function that maps input values to output values. For example, input value 3 becomes 2, 0 becomes 0, etc. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves the input's values and their positions. For example, the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell's value is determined by the input's cell in a certain way, possibly involving the row and column indices.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. This seems to be a pattern that is symmetric. The first and last elements are 2, the second and fifth are 4, the third and fourth are 3. So it's a symmetric pattern. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0, which is also symmetric. The third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0, which is symmetric. So the entire output is symmetric in rows and columns.\n\nThis suggests that the output is symmetric. So perhaps the transformation involves creating a symmetric grid based on the input.\n\nBut how to relate the input to this symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell's value is determined by the input's cell in a certain way, and the grid is symmetric.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find the exact pattern. Maybe I should try to think of the output for example 1 as being generated by some pattern that involves the input's rows and columns.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the input has three rows. The output has six rows. The output's first two rows are derived from the first input row, the next two rows from the second input row, and the last two from the third input row. Similarly, the columns are divided into three parts, each corresponding to the input's columns.\n\nFor example, the first two columns of the output are derived from the first column of the input. The next two columns from the second column, and so on. But how?\n\nLooking at the first column of the output for example 1's first two rows: 2, 0. The first column of the input is 3, 3, 3. Maybe the first two rows of the first column are derived from the input's first column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each row into two rows, and each column into two columns. For example, the first row of the input is expanded into two rows, and each of those rows is filled with values derived from the input's row.\n\nBut again, how to determine the values.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled with the input's cell's value, but with some transformation. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is used to fill the output's cell (2i, 2j), (2i, 2j+1), (2i+1, 2j), (2i+1, 2j+1). But what values are used for each of these four positions?\n\nIn example 1, the first input cell is 3 at (0,0). The output's first 2x2 block is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 0 4 \n\nSo for the four positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), the values are 2,4,0,4. How is this derived from the input value 3?\n\nMaybe there's a pattern where the top-left value is 2, top-right is 4, bottom-left is 0, bottom-right is 4. But how to derive these from 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are derived from the input's value and its position. For example, the top-left value is 2, which is 3-1, the top-right is 4, which is 3+1, the bottom-left is 0, which is 3-3, and the bottom-right is 4 again.\n\nBut this is just speculation. Without more examples, it's hard to confirm.\n\nLooking at the second input cell in example 1, which is 0 at (0,1). The corresponding 2x2 block in the output would be columns 2-3, rows 0-1. The values are 3,3,3,4. So for the block:\n\nRow 0: 3 3\nRow 1: 3 4 \n\nHow does this relate to the input value 0?\n\nMaybe the value is 0, and the block is filled with 3s and 4s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled based on the input's value and the position in the block. For example, the top-left value is the input value plus 2, but that doesn't fit for the first cell.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Maybe I should try to think of a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output's third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0. This seems to be a row where the middle two cells are 3, and the rest are 0. The input's third row is 3 4 2. Maybe the third row of the output is derived from the third row of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows and columns and creating a grid where each cell is filled based on the input's cell in a certain way. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell at (i//2, j//2), but with some transformation.\n\nFor example, for the first cell (0,0) in the output, it's derived from input's (0,0) which is 3. If the transformation is to take the input's value and subtract 1, then 3-1=2. That matches the first cell of the output. The next cell (0,1) in the output is 4, which could be input's value 3 plus 1. Then for (1,0), the value is 0, which could be input's value 3 minus 3. For (1,1), it's 4, which is input's value 3 plus 1. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nBut this is just for the first cell. How to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the input's value and use it to generate a 2x2 block where the values are based on the input's value and its position in the block. For example, the top-left cell is input value -1, top-right is input value +1, bottom-left is input value -3, and bottom-right is input value +1. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn the first block (input value 3), the values would be:\n\n2 4\n0 4\n\nWhich matches the first 2x2 block in the output. For the second block (input value 0), the values would be:\n\n-1 1\n-3 1 \n\nBut this would be negative, which doesn't match the output. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother approach: looking at example 2's output. The input is 4x4. The output is 8x8. But according to the problem, the output must be 6x6. So perhaps the examples are not following the same pattern. But the user provided example 2's input and output. Let me look at it.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\n0 6 0 0\n4 6 0 3\n4 6 3 0\n4 3 3 0\n\nOutput is:\n\n0 3 3 4 4 3 3 0\n0 3 6 4 4 6 3 0\n3 0 6 4 4 6 0 3\n0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n3 0 6 4 4 6 0 3\n0 3 6 4 4 6 3 0\n0 3 3 4 4 3 3 0\n\nBut according to the problem, the output must be 6x6. So perhaps this example is not part of the problem's training examples, but the user provided it for context. Or perhaps the example is incorrect.\n\nBut regardless, the user says that the output must be 6x6. So the function must take any input grid and produce a 6x6 output grid.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the pattern is to expand the input grid into a 6x6 grid by some transformation. For example, each cell in the input is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output. But how to determine the values in the block.\n\nLooking at example 1's first block (input value 3), the 2x2 block is:\n\n2 4\n0 4 \n\nMaybe this block is derived from the input value and some pattern. For example, the top row is 2 and 4, which could be derived from 3-1 and 3+1. The bottom row is 0 and 4, which could be 3-3 and 3+1. But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each input cell, the 2x2 block is:\n\ntop-left: input value -1\ntop-right: input value +1\nbottom-left: input value -3\nbottom-right: input value +1\n\nBut this would work for the first block (3-1=2, 3+1=4, 3-3=0, 3+1=4). This matches the first block.\n\nNow, let's check the second block in example 1. The input value is 0 (at (0,1)). The 2x2 block would be:\n\n0-1 = -1, 0+1 = 1\n0-3 = -3, 0+1 = 1\n\nBut in the output, the second block (columns 2-3, rows 0-1) is:\n\n3 3\n3 4 \n\nThis doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2x2 block is determined by the input value and its position in the block. For example, the top-left is input value + 2, top-right is input value + 2, bottom-left is input value + 2, bottom-right is input value + 2. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2x2 block is determined by the input value and the row and column in the block. For example, the top-left cell is input value + 2, the top-right is input value + 2, the bottom-left is input value + 2, and the bottom-right is input value + 2. But this would give all 3's in the first block, which doesn't match.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0. This row has 3's in the middle. The input's third row is 3 4 2. Maybe this row is derived from the input's third row. For example, the middle two cells are 3, which is the first cell of the input's third row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: the output of example 1 has a pattern where the first two rows are derived from the input's first two rows, and the third and fourth rows are derived from the input's third row. For example, the first two rows of the output are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nRow 1: 0 4 3 3 4 0 \n\nThis could be a combination of the input's first and second rows. The third and fourth rows are:\n\nRow 2: 0 0 3 3 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 3 3 0 0 \n\nWhich might be derived from the input's third row. The fifth and sixth rows are the same as the second and first rows.\n\nSo perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's rows and columns and expanding them into the 6x6 grid. For example, the first two rows of the output are generated from the first two rows of the input, the next two rows from the third row of the input, and the last two rows from the first two rows again.\n\nBut how to determine the values.\n\nIn example 1's first row of input is 3 0 0. The first two rows of the output are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nRow 1: 0 4 3 3 4 0 \n\nThis seems like the first row of the output is a combination of the input's first row and second row. For example, the first two columns are derived from the input's first row, the next two columns from the second row, and so on. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's first two rows are derived from the input's first row and second row in some way. For example, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2, which could be a combination of the input's first row (3 0 0) and second row (3 4 0). Maybe the first row of the output is derived from the input's first row and second row by some transformation.\n\nBut without knowing the exact transformation, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nAssuming that the output is generated by expanding each input cell into a 2x2 block, and the values in the block are determined by the input cell's value and its position in the block.\n\nFor example, for each input cell (i,j), the 2x2 block in the output is at positions (2i, 2j) to (2i+1, 2j+1). The values in the block are:\n\n- Top-left: input value -1\n- Top-right: input value +1\n- Bottom-left: input value -3\n- Bottom-right: input value +1\n\nThis would work for the first block in example 1 (input value 3), giving 2,4,0,4.\n\nFor the second block (input value 0), this would give -1,1,-3,1, which doesn't match the output. But in the output, the second block (columns 2-3, rows 0-1) is 3,3,3,4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are derived from the input value and its position in the block. For example, the top-left is input value + 2, top-right is input value + 2, bottom-left is input value + 2, bottom-right is input value + 2. But this would give all 3's in the first block, which doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled with the input's cell's value, but with some pattern. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the input's cell's value if it's in the first three rows and columns, and some other value otherwise. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled based on the input's cell in a certain way, such as the input's cell is used to determine the value in the output's cell. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell at (i//2, j//2), but with some transformation.\n\nBut how to determine the transformation.\n\nIn example 1, the output's first cell (0,0) is 2, and the input's cell (0,0) is 3. So 2 = 3 - 1. The output's cell (0,1) is 4, which is 3 + 1. The output's cell (1,0) is 0, which is 3 - 3. The output's cell (1,1) is 4, which is 3 + 1. This suggests that the transformation for the 2x2 block is:\n\ntop-left: input value - 1\ntop-right: input value + 1\nbottom-left: input value - 3\nbottom-right: input value + 1\n\nThis pattern seems to work for the first block. Let's check the second block in example 1. The input value is 0. So the 2x2 block would be:\n\n0 - 1 = -1, 0 + 1 = 1\n0 - 3 = -3, 0 + 1 = 1 \n\nBut in the output, the second block (columns 2-3, rows 0-1) is:\n\n3 3\n3 4 \n\nThis doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe there's a different pattern. For example, the values are determined by the input's value and the position in the block. For example, the top-left is input value + 2, top-right is input value + 2, bottom-left is input value + 2, bottom-right is input value + 2. But this would give 3+2=5 for the first block, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are derived from the input's value and the row and column in the block. For example, the top-left is input value + 2, top-right is input value + 2, bottom-left is input value + 2, bottom-right is input value + 2. But this doesn't work.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern in the examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's output, the input is 4x4, and the output is 8x8. But according to the problem, the output must be 6x6. So perhaps the examples are not correct, but the user provided them for context. Let me look at the output of example 2.\n\nThe output for example 2 is an 8x8 grid, but the problem says that the output must be 6x6. So perhaps the examples are not part of the problem's training examples, but the user provided them for context.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the pattern is that the output is generated by expanding the input into a 6x6 grid by some transformation. For example, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled based on the input's cell.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled with the input's cell's value, but with some pattern. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is filled with the input's cell's value if it's in the first three rows and columns, and some other value otherwise. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled with the input's cell's value, but with some transformation. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the input's cell's value if it's in the first three rows and columns, and 0 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the first example and implement it, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAssuming that the output is generated by expanding each input cell into a 2x2 block, and the values in the block are determined by the input's value and some pattern.\n\nFor example, for each input cell (i,j), the 2x2 block in the output is at positions (2i, 2j) to (2i+1, 2j+1). The values in the block are:\n\n- Top-left: input value - 1\n- Top-right: input value + 1\n- Bottom-left: input value - 3\n- Bottom-right: input value + 1\n\nThis works for the first block in example 1. For the second block in example 1, the input value is 0, so the block would be -1, 1, -3, 1. But in the output, the second block is 3, 3, 3, 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the values are derived from the input's value and the row and column in the block. For example, the top-left is input value + 2, top-right is input value + 2, bottom-left is input value + 2, bottom-right is input value + 2. But this would give 5 for the first block, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are derived from the input's value and the position in the block. For example, the top-left is input value + 2, top-right is input value + 2, bottom-left is input value + 2, bottom-right is input value + 2. But this doesn't work.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the first example. Even if it's not perfect, I'll proceed.\n\nSo, the hypothesis is that each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output. The values in the block are determined by the input's value and some pattern. For example, the top-left is input value -1, top-right is input value +1, bottom-left is input value -3, and bottom-right is input value +1.\n\nEven though this doesn't fit the second block in example 1, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and see if it can be implemented.\n\nNow, the function needs to take the input grid and generate a 6x6 output grid.\n\nSo, for each cell in the input grid, we need to generate a 2x2 block in the output. The input grid can be of any size, but the output is always 6x6.\n\nBut how to handle input grids of different sizes? For example, if the input is 3x3, then each cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, giving 6x6. If the input is 4x4, then expanding each cell into a 2x2 block would give 8x8, but the output must be 6x6. So this approach is not correct.\n\nBut according to the problem, the output must be 6x6, so the input must be of a size that allows the output to be 6x6. For example, if the input is 3x3, then 3*2=6 rows and columns. If the input is 2x2, then 2*3=6 rows and columns? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nThis suggests that the input is always a 3x3 grid, and the output is 6x6. But the problem says that the input can be any size, but the output is always 6x6.\n\nThis is confusing. But given the examples, perhaps the input is always a 3x3 grid, and the output is 6x6. So the function is to take a 3x3 input and generate a 6x6 output.\n\nBut the test input is 8x8. So this suggests that the input can be of any size, and the output is always 6x6. So the function needs to map any input grid to a 6x6 output grid.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the input is used to generate a 6x6 grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain way. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is filled based on the input's cell in the same position, but with some transformation.\n\nBut without knowing the transformation, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is generated by expanding each cell into a 2x2 block, with the values as described earlier.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Assume input is 3x3\n    output = [[0]*6 for _ in range(6)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            # Calculate the 2x2 block in the output\n            start_row = i * 2\n            start_col = j * 2\n            # Fill the block\n            output[start_row][start_col] = val - 1\n            output[start_row][start_col + 1] = val + 1\n            output[start_row + 1][start_col] = val - 3\n            output[start_row + 1][start_col + 1] = val + 1\n    return output\n\nBut this would work for example 1, but not for other examples. For example, in example 1's second block (input value 0), this would give -1, 1, -3, 1, which doesn't match the output's 3,3,3,4.\n\nBut perhaps this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are derived from the input's value and the position in the block. For example, the top-left is input value, top-right is input value, bottom-left is input value, bottom-right is input value. But this would give 3,3,3,3 for the first block, which doesn't match the output.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled with the input's cell's value, but with some pattern. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the input's cell's value if it's in the first three rows and columns, and 0 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis and implement it, even if it's not correct for all examples. The code would be as follows.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. Let me look at Example 1 first. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid. Wait, but the problem says that the output must always be 6x6. So the input is probably a smaller grid, and the output is a larger grid generated from it. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\nRow 0: 3 0 0\nRow 1: 3 4 0\nRow 2: 3 4 2\n\nThe output is a 6x6 grid. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in how the input is expanded. Maybe each cell in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output? Because 3x3 input would become 6x6 if each cell is replaced by 2x2. Let me check.\n\nFor example, the first row of the input is 3, 0, 0. If each of these is expanded into a 2x2 block, then the first two rows of the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 3 4 2 (but that's the first row of output)\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. The output for example 1 is:\n\nFirst line of output: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nSecond line: 0 4 3 3 4 0\nThird: 0 0 3 3 0 0\nFourth: 0 0 3 3 0 0\nFifth: 0 4 3 3 4 0\nSixth: 2 4 3 3 4 2\n\nHmm. Let me see if there's a pattern. The input is 3x3. The output is 6x6. So perhaps each input cell is transformed into a 2x2 block. Let's see for the first input cell (3,0,0). The first row of the output starts with 2,4,3... Maybe the input cell is being mapped to a 2x2 block where the values are arranged in some way. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input grid is mirrored or rotated. For example, the input's first row is 3 0 0. The output's first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. Wait, that seems like a pattern. Let me check the output rows. The first row of output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The third is 0 0 3 3 0 0. Fourth same as third. Fifth same as second. Sixth same as first. So the output seems to have some symmetry. Maybe the input is being used to generate a pattern that's mirrored or repeated.\n\nWait, the input is 3x3. The output is 6x6. Maybe the input is being expanded into a 2x2 block for each cell. Let's think of each cell in the input as being transformed into a 2x2 block. For example, the first cell (3) in the input's first row might be transformed into a 2x2 block that's 2 4 3 3 4 2? No, that's a 6x6. Wait, perhaps each cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, but the entire input grid is arranged in a way that when expanded, the output is 6x6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is determined by some function of the input. For example, the input's first row is 3,0,0. The output's first row is 2,4,3,3,4,2. Maybe the first row of the output is a combination of the first row of the input and some other rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. Third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0. Fourth same as third. Fifth same as second. Sixth same as first. So the output has a pattern where the first two rows are mirrored, then the next two rows are zeroed, then the same as the second two rows. Maybe the input is used to generate a pattern that's repeated in the output.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 3 0 0\nRow 1: 3 4 0\nRow 2: 3 4 2\n\nIf I think of the output as being generated by some transformation that uses the input's values in a certain way. For example, maybe the output is generated by taking each cell in the input and expanding it into a 2x2 block, but with some pattern. For example, the first cell (3) in the input might be transformed into a 2x2 block that's 2 4 3 3 4 2? Wait, that's not 2x2. Maybe each cell is transformed into a 2x2 block, but the entire input is arranged in a way that when expanded, the output is 6x6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 2x2 grid for each cell, then arranging them in a way that forms the 6x6 grid. For example, the input is 3x3, so each cell is in a 2x2 block, and the total would be 6x6. Let me think: 3 rows in input, each row has 3 cells. Each cell is expanded into 2 rows and 2 columns, so total rows would be 3*2=6, columns 3*2=6. That makes sense.\n\nSo for each cell in the input grid, we create a 2x2 block in the output. But how are the values in the 2x2 block determined?\n\nLooking at the first cell of the input (row 0, column 0) which is 3. The corresponding 2x2 block in the output would be the first two rows and first two columns of the output. But looking at the output's first two rows:\n\nFirst row: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nSecond row: 0 4 3 3 4 0\n\nWait, the first two rows of the output are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nRow 1: 0 4 3 3 4 0\n\nBut if each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, then the first cell (3) would be in the top-left 2x2 block. But the first two rows of the output's first two columns are:\n\n2, 4\n0, 4\n\nWhich is a 2x2 block. But how does that relate to the input's value 3? Maybe the value is used to generate the 2x2 block. For example, maybe the value is used as the center of the block. Or perhaps the value is used in some way to generate the block's values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2x2 block is determined by the input cell's value. For example, if the input cell is 3, then the 2x2 block is:\n\n2 4\n4 2\n\nBut that would be a 2x2 block. Then, the first cell's 2x2 block would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 4 2\n\nBut looking at the first two rows of the output, the first two columns are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 0 4 \n\nHmm, that doesn't match. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0. Fourth same as third. Fifth same as second. Sixth same as first.\n\nSo the output seems to have a pattern where the first two rows are mirrored, then the next two rows are zeros, then mirrored again. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the first row is 3 0 0. The second row is 3 4 0. Third is 3 4 2. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows and columns and expanding them into a 2x2 block. For example, the first row of the input is 3, 0, 0. So each of these three cells is expanded into a 2x2 block. The first cell (3) would be in the first 2x2 block of the output, the second cell (0) in the next 2x2 block, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input grid and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell in the input is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output. For example, for each cell (i,j) in the input, the corresponding 2x2 block in the output would be at positions (2i, 2j) to (2i+1, 2j+1). Then, the values in the 2x2 block are determined by some function of the input cell's value.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at the first input cell (3) in (0,0). The corresponding 2x2 block in the output would be rows 0-1, columns 0-1. The values in that block are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 0 4 \n\nBut how does 3 relate to these numbers? Maybe the value is used to generate the numbers in the block. For example, maybe the block is filled with numbers that are derived from the input value. For instance, if the input value is 3, then the block is 2,4, 0,4. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with numbers that are based on the input value and some other pattern. For example, the first row of the block is 2 and 4, then the second row is 0 and 4. But I don't see a direct connection.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0. Fourth same as third. Fifth same as second. Sixth same as first.\n\nSo the output has a pattern where the first two rows are mirrored, then the next two rows are zeroed, then mirrored again. But how does that relate to the input? The input's first row is 3 0 0. The second row is 3 4 0. Third row is 3 4 2.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each row of the output is a combination of the input's rows and columns. For example, the first two rows of the output are generated from the first row of the input, and the next two rows from the second row of the input, etc. But that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 6x6 grid that is a combination of the input's rows and columns in some way. For example, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The input's first row is 3 0 0. Maybe the output is generated by some transformation that uses the input's values and their positions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2. The input is a 4x4 grid, and the output is an 8x8 grid. Wait, but the problem says the output must be 6x6. Wait, the example 2's input is 4 rows and 4 columns. The output is 8 rows and 8 columns? But the problem says that the output must be 6x6. Wait, no, the problem says that the output must be 6x6. But the examples given may have different input and output sizes. Wait, the first example's input is 3x3 and output is 6x6. The second example's input is 4x4 and output is 8x8? But that's not possible. Wait, looking at example 2:\n\nInput is 4 rows (each with 4 elements), and the output is 8 rows (each with 8 elements). But the problem says that the output must be 6x6. So maybe the examples are not following that, but the test input is 8x8? Wait, the test input is given as 8 rows with 8 elements each. But according to the problem, the output must be 6x6. So perhaps the examples are not following that, but the test input is 8x8. But the problem says that the output must be 6x6. So maybe the examples are not correct. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the problem says that the output must be 6x6. So the test input is 8x8, but the output must be 6x6. So the examples given in the problem are not the same as the test input. So the user is providing training examples where the input is of varying sizes, but the output is always 6x6. So the input can be of any size, but the output must be 6x6. So the function must take an input grid of any size and produce a 6x6 output grid.\n\nBut how? How to map a general input grid to a 6x6 output grid? That's the challenge.\n\nLooking back at example 1, the input is 3x3. The output is 6x6. So perhaps the input is used to generate a 6x6 grid by some transformation. Maybe the input is used as a pattern that is expanded into the 6x6 grid. For example, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid that is generated by some pattern based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain way. For example, if the input is a 3x3 grid, then each cell is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output. So the output is 6x6, which is 3*2 x 3*2.\n\nBut how to determine the values in the 2x2 blocks?\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first two rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nRow 1: 0 4 3 3 4 0\n\nIf the input's first row is 3 0 0, then each of these three cells would be expanded into 2x2 blocks. For example, the first cell (3) would generate a 2x2 block. Let's look at the first two columns of the output's first two rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 0 4 \n\nThis seems to be a 2x2 block. How does this relate to the input's value 3? Maybe the block is filled with numbers that are derived from the input's value and some other pattern. For example, the first row of the block is 2 and 4, the second row is 0 and 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2x2 block is determined by the input's cell's value and its position. For example, the first row of the block is 2 and 4, which could be derived from the input's value 3. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's input:\n\nInput rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 6 0 0\nRow 1: 4 6 0 3\nRow 2: 4 6 3 0\nRow 3: 4 3 3 0\n\nThe output is an 8x8 grid. Wait, but according to the problem, the output must be 6x6. So perhaps the examples are not correct. Or perhaps the examples are not following the same pattern. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some other pattern. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid that is generated by some transformation based on the input's rows and columns. For example, the input is used to generate a grid where certain positions are filled based on the input's values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain way. For example, the input's cell is used to determine the value in the output's cell. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0. Fourth same as third. Fifth same as second. Sixth same as first. So the output has a pattern where the first two rows are mirrored, then the next two rows are zeroed, then mirrored again. Maybe the input is used to determine the values in these rows. For example, the first row of the input is 3 0 0. The first two rows of the output are 2 4 3 3 4 2 and 0 4 3 3 4 0. Maybe the first row of the input is used to generate the first two rows of the output, and the second row of the input is used to generate the next two rows, and the third row of the input is used for the last two rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows and columns and using them to create a pattern that is mirrored or repeated. For example, the first row of the output is a combination of the input's first row and some other values.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output for example 1. The output has a pattern where the first two rows are mirrored, then the next two are zeroed, then mirrored again. The values in the first two rows are 2,4,3,3,4,2 and 0,4,3,3,4,0. The third and fourth rows are zeros except for the middle part. The fifth and sixth rows are the same as the second and first rows.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the first row is 3 0 0. The second row is 3 4 0. The third is 3 4 2. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that is a combination of the input's values and some pattern based on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell's value is determined by the input's cell in a certain way. For example, the output's cell at (i,j) is determined by the input's cell at (i//2, j//2). But this would be for a 3x3 input. Let's see.\n\nFor example, the output's first row (i=0) would be determined by input's (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). But how? For the first two columns of the output's first row, the values are 2 and 4. If the input's (0,0) is 3, then perhaps 2 and 4 are derived from that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of expansion where the input's values are used to create a pattern. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled based on the input's cell in a certain way. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell at (i//2, j//2), but with some transformation.\n\nBut how to determine the transformation? For example, in example 1, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The input's first row is 3 0 0. So for the first two columns of the output's first row, the values are 2 and 4. Maybe these are derived from the input's cell (0,0) and (0,1). For example, the first cell (0,0) is 3, and the first two values are 2 and 4. Maybe the first row of the output's first 2x2 block is [2,4], and the second row is [0,4]. Then, the next 2x2 block is [3,3], [3,4], etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the first two rows of the output are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nRow 1: 0 4 3 3 4 0\n\nThis looks like the first two rows are a combination of the input's first row and the second row. For example, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The input's first row is 3 0 0. The second row of the input is 3 4 0. Maybe the first two rows of the output are generated by some transformation of the input's first two rows. For example, the first row of the output is derived from the input's first row and the second row.\n\nBut I'm not seeing the exact pattern. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows and columns and creating a pattern where the output is a combination of the input's values in a certain way. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid that is a combination of the input's values and their positions.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled based on the input's cell in a certain way. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i//2, j//2). But then, how to determine the value?\n\nIn example 1, the output's first cell (0,0) is 2. The input's cell (0,0) is 3. So 2 is derived from 3. Maybe there's a function that maps input values to output values. For example, input value 3 becomes 2, 0 becomes 0, etc. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves the input's values and their positions. For example, the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell's value is determined by the input's cell in a certain way, possibly involving the row and column indices.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. This seems to be a pattern that is symmetric. The first and last elements are 2, the second and fifth are 4, the third and fourth are 3. So it's a symmetric pattern. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0, which is also symmetric. The third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0, which is symmetric. So the entire output is symmetric in rows and columns.\n\nThis suggests that the output is symmetric. So perhaps the transformation involves creating a symmetric grid based on the input.\n\nBut how to relate the input to this symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell's value is determined by the input's cell in a certain way, and the grid is symmetric.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find the exact pattern. Maybe I should try to think of the output for example 1 as being generated by some pattern that involves the input's rows and columns.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the input has three rows. The output has six rows. The output's first two rows are derived from the first input row, the next two rows from the second input row, and the last two from the third input row. Similarly, the columns are divided into three parts, each corresponding to the input's columns.\n\nFor example, the first two columns of the output are derived from the first column of the input. The next two columns from the second column, and so on. But how?\n\nLooking at the first column of the output for example 1's first two rows: 2, 0. The first column of the input is 3, 3, 3. Maybe the first two rows of the first column are derived from the input's first column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each row into two rows, and each column into two columns. For example, the first row of the input is expanded into two rows, and each of those rows is filled with values derived from the input's row.\n\nBut again, how to determine the values.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled with the input's cell's value, but with some transformation. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is used to fill the output's cell (2i, 2j), (2i, 2j+1), (2i+1, 2j), (2i+1, 2j+1). But what values are used for each of these four positions?\n\nIn example 1, the first input cell is 3 at (0,0). The output's first 2x2 block is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 0 4 \n\nSo for the four positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), the values are 2,4,0,4. How is this derived from the input value 3?\n\nMaybe there's a pattern where the top-left value is 2, top-right is 4, bottom-left is 0, bottom-right is 4. But how to derive these from 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are derived from the input's value and its position. For example, the top-left value is 2, which is 3-1, the top-right is 4, which is 3+1, the bottom-left is 0, which is 3-3, and the bottom-right is 4 again.\n\nBut this is just speculation. Without more examples, it's hard to confirm.\n\nLooking at the second input cell in example 1, which is 0 at (0,1). The corresponding 2x2 block in the output would be columns 2-3, rows 0-1. The values are 3,3,3,4. So for the block:\n\nRow 0: 3 3\nRow 1: 3 4 \n\nHow does this relate to the input value 0?\n\nMaybe the value is 0, and the block is filled with 3s and 4s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled based on the input's value and the position in the block. For example, the top-left value is the input value plus 2, but that doesn't fit for the first cell.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Maybe I should try to think of a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output's third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0. This seems to be a row where the middle two cells are 3, and the rest are 0. The input's third row is 3 4 2. Maybe the third row of the output is derived from the third row of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows and columns and creating a grid where each cell is filled based on the input's cell in a certain way. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell at (i//2, j//2), but with some transformation.\n\nFor example, for the first cell (0,0) in the output, it's derived from input's (0,0) which is 3. If the transformation is to take the input's value and subtract 1, then 3-1=2. That matches the first cell of the output. The next cell (0,1) in the output is 4, which could be input's value 3 plus 1. Then for (1,0), the value is 0, which could be input's value 3 minus 3. For (1,1), it's 4, which is input's value 3 plus 1. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nBut this is just for the first cell. How to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the input's value and use it to generate a 2x2 block where the values are based on the input's value and its position in the block. For example, the top-left cell is input value -1, top-right is input value +1, bottom-left is input value -3, and bottom-right is input value +1. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn the first block (input value 3), the values would be:\n\n2 4\n0 4\n\nWhich matches the first 2x2 block in the output. For the second block (input value 0), the values would be:\n\n-1 1\n-3 1 \n\nBut this would be negative, which doesn't match the output. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother approach: looking at example 2's output. The input is 4x4. The output is 8x8. But according to the problem, the output must be 6x6. So perhaps the examples are not following the same pattern. But the user provided example 2's input and output. Let me look at it.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\n0 6 0 0\n4 6 0 3\n4 6 3 0\n4 3 3 0\n\nOutput is:\n\n0 3 3 4 4 3 3 0\n0 3 6 4 4 6 3 0\n3 0 6 4 4 6 0 3\n0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n3 0 6 4 4 6 0 3\n0 3 6 4 4 6 3 0\n0 3 3 4 4 3 3 0\n\nBut according to the problem, the output must be 6x6. So perhaps this example is not part of the problem's training examples, but the user provided it for context. Or perhaps the example is incorrect.\n\nBut regardless, the user says that the output must be 6x6. So the function must take any input grid and produce a 6x6 output grid.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the pattern is to expand the input grid into a 6x6 grid by some transformation. For example, each cell in the input is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output. But how to determine the values in the block.\n\nLooking at example 1's first block (input value 3), the 2x2 block is:\n\n2 4\n0 4 \n\nMaybe this block is derived from the input value and some pattern. For example, the top row is 2 and 4, which could be derived from 3-1 and 3+1. The bottom row is 0 and 4, which could be 3-3 and 3+1. But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each input cell, the 2x2 block is:\n\ntop-left: input value -1\ntop-right: input value +1\nbottom-left: input value -3\nbottom-right: input value +1\n\nBut this would work for the first block (3-1=2, 3+1=4, 3-3=0, 3+1=4). This matches the first block.\n\nNow, let's check the second block in example 1. The input value is 0 (at (0,1)). The 2x2 block would be:\n\n0-1 = -1, 0+1 = 1\n0-3 = -3, 0+1 = 1\n\nBut in the output, the second block (columns 2-3, rows 0-1) is:\n\n3 3\n3 4 \n\nThis doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2x2 block is determined by the input value and its position in the block. For example, the top-left is input value + 2, top-right is input value + 2, bottom-left is input value + 2, bottom-right is input value + 2. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2x2 block is determined by the input value and the row and column in the block. For example, the top-left cell is input value + 2, the top-right is input value + 2, the bottom-left is input value + 2, and the bottom-right is input value + 2. But this would give all 3's in the first block, which doesn't match.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0. This row has 3's in the middle. The input's third row is 3 4 2. Maybe this row is derived from the input's third row. For example, the middle two cells are 3, which is the first cell of the input's third row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: the output of example 1 has a pattern where the first two rows are derived from the input's first two rows, and the third and fourth rows are derived from the input's third row. For example, the first two rows of the output are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nRow 1: 0 4 3 3 4 0 \n\nThis could be a combination of the input's first and second rows. The third and fourth rows are:\n\nRow 2: 0 0 3 3 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 3 3 0 0 \n\nWhich might be derived from the input's third row. The fifth and sixth rows are the same as the second and first rows.\n\nSo perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's rows and columns and expanding them into the 6x6 grid. For example, the first two rows of the output are generated from the first two rows of the input, the next two rows from the third row of the input, and the last two rows from the first two rows again.\n\nBut how to determine the values.\n\nIn example 1's first row of input is 3 0 0. The first two rows of the output are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nRow 1: 0 4 3 3 4 0 \n\nThis seems like the first row of the output is a combination of the input's first row and second row. For example, the first two columns are derived from the input's first row, the next two columns from the second row, and so on. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output's first two rows are derived from the input's first row and second row in some way. For example, the first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2, which could be a combination of the input's first row (3 0 0) and second row (3 4 0). Maybe the first row of the output is derived from the input's first row and second row by some transformation.\n\nBut without knowing the exact transformation, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nAssuming that the output is generated by expanding each input cell into a 2x2 block, and the values in the block are determined by the input cell's value and its position in the block.\n\nFor example, for each input cell (i,j), the 2x2 block in the output is at positions (2i, 2j) to (2i+1, 2j+1). The values in the block are:\n\n- Top-left: input value -1\n- Top-right: input value +1\n- Bottom-left: input value -3\n- Bottom-right: input value +1\n\nThis would work for the first block in example 1 (input value 3), giving 2,4,0,4.\n\nFor the second block (input value 0), this would give -1,1,-3,1, which doesn't match the output. But in the output, the second block (columns 2-3, rows 0-1) is 3,3,3,4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are derived from the input value and its position in the block. For example, the top-left is input value + 2, top-right is input value + 2, bottom-left is input value + 2, bottom-right is input value + 2. But this would give all 3's in the first block, which doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled with the input's cell's value, but with some pattern. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the input's cell's value if it's in the first three rows and columns, and some other value otherwise. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled based on the input's cell in a certain way, such as the input's cell is used to determine the value in the output's cell. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell at (i//2, j//2), but with some transformation.\n\nBut how to determine the transformation.\n\nIn example 1, the output's first cell (0,0) is 2, and the input's cell (0,0) is 3. So 2 = 3 - 1. The output's cell (0,1) is 4, which is 3 + 1. The output's cell (1,0) is 0, which is 3 - 3. The output's cell (1,1) is 4, which is 3 + 1. This suggests that the transformation for the 2x2 block is:\n\ntop-left: input value - 1\ntop-right: input value + 1\nbottom-left: input value - 3\nbottom-right: input value + 1\n\nThis pattern seems to work for the first block. Let's check the second block in example 1. The input value is 0. So the 2x2 block would be:\n\n0 - 1 = -1, 0 + 1 = 1\n0 - 3 = -3, 0 + 1 = 1 \n\nBut in the output, the second block (columns 2-3, rows 0-1) is:\n\n3 3\n3 4 \n\nThis doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe there's a different pattern. For example, the values are determined by the input's value and the position in the block. For example, the top-left is input value + 2, top-right is input value + 2, bottom-left is input value + 2, bottom-right is input value + 2. But this would give 3+2=5 for the first block, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are derived from the input's value and the row and column in the block. For example, the top-left is input value + 2, top-right is input value + 2, bottom-left is input value + 2, bottom-right is input value + 2. But this doesn't work.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern in the examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's output, the input is 4x4, and the output is 8x8. But according to the problem, the output must be 6x6. So perhaps the examples are not correct, but the user provided them for context. Let me look at the output of example 2.\n\nThe output for example 2 is an 8x8 grid, but the problem says that the output must be 6x6. So perhaps the examples are not part of the problem's training examples, but the user provided them for context.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the pattern is that the output is generated by expanding the input into a 6x6 grid by some transformation. For example, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled based on the input's cell.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled with the input's cell's value, but with some pattern. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is filled with the input's cell's value if it's in the first three rows and columns, and some other value otherwise. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled with the input's cell's value, but with some transformation. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the input's cell's value if it's in the first three rows and columns, and 0 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the first example and implement it, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAssuming that the output is generated by expanding each input cell into a 2x2 block, and the values in the block are determined by the input's value and some pattern.\n\nFor example, for each input cell (i,j), the 2x2 block in the output is at positions (2i, 2j) to (2i+1, 2j+1). The values in the block are:\n\n- Top-left: input value - 1\n- Top-right: input value + 1\n- Bottom-left: input value - 3\n- Bottom-right: input value + 1\n\nThis works for the first block in example 1. For the second block in example 1, the input value is 0, so the block would be -1, 1, -3, 1. But in the output, the second block is 3, 3, 3, 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the values are derived from the input's value and the row and column in the block. For example, the top-left is input value + 2, top-right is input value + 2, bottom-left is input value + 2, bottom-right is input value + 2. But this would give 5 for the first block, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are derived from the input's value and the position in the block. For example, the top-left is input value + 2, top-right is input value + 2, bottom-left is input value + 2, bottom-right is input value + 2. But this doesn't work.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the first example. Even if it's not perfect, I'll proceed.\n\nSo, the hypothesis is that each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output. The values in the block are determined by the input's value and some pattern. For example, the top-left is input value -1, top-right is input value +1, bottom-left is input value -3, and bottom-right is input value +1.\n\nEven though this doesn't fit the second block in example 1, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and see if it can be implemented.\n\nNow, the function needs to take the input grid and generate a 6x6 output grid.\n\nSo, for each cell in the input grid, we need to generate a 2x2 block in the output. The input grid can be of any size, but the output is always 6x6.\n\nBut how to handle input grids of different sizes? For example, if the input is 3x3, then each cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, giving 6x6. If the input is 4x4, then expanding each cell into a 2x2 block would give 8x8, but the output must be 6x6. So this approach is not correct.\n\nBut according to the problem, the output must be 6x6, so the input must be of a size that allows the output to be 6x6. For example, if the input is 3x3, then 3*2=6 rows and columns. If the input is 2x2, then 2*3=6 rows and columns? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nThis suggests that the input is always a 3x3 grid, and the output is 6x6. But the problem says that the input can be any size, but the output is always 6x6.\n\nThis is confusing. But given the examples, perhaps the input is always a 3x3 grid, and the output is 6x6. So the function is to take a 3x3 input and generate a 6x6 output.\n\nBut the test input is 8x8. So this suggests that the input can be of any size, and the output is always 6x6. So the function needs to map any input grid to a 6x6 output grid.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the input is used to generate a 6x6 grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain way. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is filled based on the input's cell in the same position, but with some transformation.\n\nBut without knowing the transformation, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is generated by expanding each cell into a 2x2 block, with the values as described earlier.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Assume input is 3x3\n    output = [[0]*6 for _ in range(6)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            # Calculate the 2x2 block in the output\n            start_row = i * 2\n            start_col = j * 2\n            # Fill the block\n            output[start_row][start_col] = val - 1\n            output[start_row][start_col + 1] = val + 1\n            output[start_row + 1][start_col] = val - 3\n            output[start_row + 1][start_col + 1] = val + 1\n    return output\n\nBut this would work for example 1, but not for other examples. For example, in example 1's second block (input value 0), this would give -1, 1, -3, 1, which doesn't match the output's 3,3,3,4.\n\nBut perhaps this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are derived from the input's value and the position in the block. For example, the top-left is input value, top-right is input value, bottom-left is input value, bottom-right is input value. But this would give 3,3,3,3 for the first block, which doesn't match the output.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled with the input's cell's value, but with some pattern. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the input's cell's value if it's in the first three rows and columns, and 0 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis and implement it, even if it's not correct for all examples. The code would be as follows.\n"
