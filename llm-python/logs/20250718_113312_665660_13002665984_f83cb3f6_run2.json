The output grid always has 17 rows and 10 columns.\n2. Some values in the input grid are transformed to 5 or 8 in the output grid.\n3. There seems to be a pattern where certain positions in the input grid are transformed to 5 or 8 based on their position.\n4. The 8s in the input grid seem to be preserved in the output grid.\n5. The 5s in the input grid seem to be transformed to 5s in the output grid in certain positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Preserves 8s in the output grid\n- Transforms 5s in certain positions to 5s in the output grid\n- Transforms other values to 0 in the output grid\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

The output grid always has 17 rows and 10 columns.\n2. Some values in the input grid are transformed to 5 or 8 in the output grid.\n3. There seems to be a pattern where certain positions in the input grid are transformed to 5 or 8 based on their position.\n4. The 8s in the input grid seem to be preserved in the output grid.\n5. The 5s in the input grid seem to be transformed to 5s in the output grid in certain positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Preserves 8s in the output grid\n- Transforms 5s in certain positions to 5s in the output grid\n- Transforms other values to 0 in the output grid\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
