The output grids often have 3s in certain positions where the input had 8s\n2. The 3s seem to appear in specific patterns, often in clusters\n3. The 3s seem to be replacing 8s in certain positions, but not all\n4. The 3s appear in specific regions of the grid, not randomly\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain 8s with 3s in specific patterns.\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace 8s with 3s in specific patterns\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on observations from the training examples\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace with 3 in specific patterns\n                # This is a simplified pattern that may not capture all cases\n                if (i + j) % 3 == 0 or (i - j) % 3 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace 8s with 3s in specific patterns\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on observations from the training examples\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace with 3 in specific patterns\n                # This is a simplified pattern that may not capture all cases\n                if (i + j) % 3 == 0 or (i - j) % 3 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
