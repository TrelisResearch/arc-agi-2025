          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. Numbers in the input grid seem to be \"moved\" or \"rotated\" in some way to new positions in the output grid\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain numbers (like 2, 3, 5, 1, 6, 4) are moved to new positions in a specific order\n3. There seems to be a pattern where numbers are moved in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction\n4. Some numbers are duplicated or repeated in the output grid\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that moves numbers in a clockwise direction and duplicates them in certain positions.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. Numbers in the input grid seem to be \"moved\" or \"rotated\" in some way to new positions in the output grid\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain numbers (like 2, 3, 5, 1, 6, 4) are moved to new positions in a specific order\n3. There seems to be a pattern where numbers are moved in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction\n4. Some numbers are duplicated or repeated in the output grid\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that moves numbers in a clockwise direction and duplicates them in certain positions.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
