          "Let's analyze the training examples carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Observations from Examples:\n\n- Both inputs are 10x10 grids, outputs are **always 3x3**.\n\n- The output grid looks like a **cropped section** from the input grid (though not always the exact center), containing mostly **non-zero colors**.\n\n- Colors in the output appear to be a kind of \"key\" subset of the input pattern colors, often clustered near the center but slightly offset.\n\n- The output is not a simple center crop (like rows 3-5 and cols 3-5):\n  \n  - Example 1 output:\n\n    ```\n    0 0 7\n    0 6 8\n    7 8 4\n    ```\n  \n  Corresponds to (approx) input rows 4-6 and cols 4-6 (0-indexed):\n\n    Checking input positions in example 1:\n\n    Input rows 3-5, cols 4-6:\n    ```\n    grid[3][4]=8, grid[3][5]=8, grid[3][6]=6\n    grid[4][4]=4, grid[4][5]=4, grid[4][6]=8\n    grid[5][4]=4, grid[5][5]=4, grid[5][6]=8\n    ```\n    \n    This is not exactly the output, but output elements appear to be chosen from or near that region with some positional shift.\n\n- Example 2 output:\n  \n  ```\n  1 0 0\n  0 3 6\n  0 5 2\n  ```\n  \n  Compare with input near center region (around rows 2-4, cols 1-5 or 2-6) reveals a similar cropping.\n\n---\n\n### My Hypothesis:\n\n- The output corresponds to a **3x3 crop around the maximal non-zero color cluster's top-left corner** or \"anchor pattern\".\n\n- The crop seems to be selected by:\n  \n  1. Finding the smallest bounding box containing the most significant colored cluster (non-zero colors)\n  \n  2. Extracting a 3x3 region starting at the top-left corner of that cluster\n  \n  3. If no cluster found, output zeros.\n\n---\n\n### How to implement:\n\n1. Find all non-zero cells.\n\n2. Determine bounding box around non-zero cells with largest cluster or just the smallest bbox containing all non-zero cells.\n\n3. Extract a 3x3 region from the bbox top-left corner.\n\n4. If bbox smaller than 3x3, pad with zeros.\n\n---\n\n### Plan:\n\n- For simplicity, find the minimal bounding box around all non-zero pixels.\n\n- Take the top-left corner of this bounding box as crop start.\n\n- Extract 3x3 from there, padding with zeros if exceeding boundaries.\n\nThis approach should capture significant parts of the colored pattern (most of the examples seem to be somewhat aligned with this).\n\n---\n\n### Let's implement this now.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find coordinates of all non-zero cells\n    nonzero_coords = [(r, c) for r in range(len(grid)) for c in range(len(grid[0])) if grid[r][c] != 0]\n    \n    if not nonzero_coords:\n        # no colors, return 3x3 zero grid\n        return [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    min_r = min(r for r, _ in nonzero_coords)\n    max_r = max(r for r, _ in nonzero_coords)\n    min_c = min(c for _, c in nonzero_coords)\n    max_c = max(c for _, c in nonzero_coords)\n    \n    # Starting point for 3x3 crop is the top-left corner of bounding box\n    start_r = min_r\n    start_c = min_c\n    \n    # Make sure to crop a 3x3 area, pad with zeros if beyond grid borders\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for dr in range(3):\n        row = []\n        r = start_r + dr\n        for dc in range(3):\n            c = start_c + dc\n            if 0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0]):\n                row.append(grid[r][c])\n            else:\n                row.append(0)\n        transformed_grid.append(row)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

              "Let's analyze the examples briefly:\n\n- Both outputs are 3x3 blocks extracted from the center area of the input.  \n- From example 1: The output corresponds to the 3x3 block starting at input[4][2] to input[6][4].  \n- From example 2: The output corresponds to the 3x3 block starting at input[1][1] to input[3][3].  \n- In both cases, the 3x3 output block is a \"prominent\" sub-region inside the input that contains many non-zero values around the center.\n\nA working heuristic based on this:\n\n- Find the bounding box of non-zero values near the center region of the input grid (roughly from rows and cols 1 to 8).  \n- If the bounding box is larger than 3x3, try to find a 3x3 sub-block inside the bounding box that has maximum non-zero content.  \n- Return that 3x3 block as the output.  \n\nThis captures the idea that output is a meaningful 3x3 excerpt capturing the core structure.\n\nThe input grids are 10x10.\n\n---\n\nImplementation plan:\n\n1. Find coords of all non-zero cells in the central 8x8 region (rows 1-8, cols 1-8).  \n2. Find min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col of these cells to create bounding box.  \n3. If bounding box < 3x3, pad it to 3x3 or extract a 3x3 around center.  \n4. Within the bounding box, slide a 3x3 window if bounding box > 3x3, choose the 3x3 block with maximal sum (or maximal count of non-zero cells).  \n5.

              "Let's analyze the training examples carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Observations from Examples:\n\n- Both inputs are 10x10 grids, outputs are **always 3x3**.\n\n- The output grid looks like a **cropped section** from the input grid (though not always the exact center), containing mostly **non-zero colors**.\n\n- Colors in the output appear to be a kind of \"key\" subset of the input pattern colors, often clustered near the center but slightly offset.\n\n- The output is not a simple center crop (like rows 3-5 and cols 3-5):\n  \n  - Example 1 output:\n\n    ```\n    0 0 7\n    0 6 8\n    7 8 4\n    ```\n  \n  Corresponds to (approx) input rows 4-6 and cols 4-6 (0-indexed):\n\n    Checking input positions in example 1:\n\n    Input rows 3-5, cols 4-6:\n    ```\n    grid[3][4]=8, grid[3][5]=8, grid[3][6]=6\n    grid[4][4]=4, grid[4][5]=4, grid[4][6]=8\n    grid[5][4]=4, grid[5][5]=4, grid[5][6]=8\n    ```\n    \n    This is not exactly the output, but output elements appear to be chosen from or near that region with some positional shift.\n\n- Example 2 output:\n  \n  ```\n  1 0 0\n  0 3 6\n  0 5 2\n  ```\n  \n  Compare with input near center region (around rows 2-4, cols 1-5 or 2-6) reveals a similar cropping.\n\n---\n\n### My Hypothesis:\n\n- The output corresponds to a **3x3 crop around the maximal non-zero color cluster's top-left corner** or \"anchor pattern\".\n\n- The crop seems to be selected by:\n  \n  1. Finding the smallest bounding box containing the most significant colored cluster (non-zero colors)\n  \n  2. Extracting a 3x3 region starting at the top-left corner of that cluster\n  \n  3. If no cluster found, output zeros.\n\n---\n\n### How to implement:\n\n1. Find all non-zero cells.\n\n2. Determine bounding box around non-zero cells with largest cluster or just the smallest bbox containing all non-zero cells.\n\n3. Extract a 3x3 region from the bbox top-left corner.\n\n4. If bbox smaller than 3x3, pad with zeros.\n\n---\n\n### Plan:\n\n- For simplicity, find the minimal bounding box around all non-zero pixels.\n\n- Take the top-left corner of this bounding box as crop start.\n\n- Extract 3x3 from there, padding with zeros if exceeding boundaries.\n\nThis approach should capture significant parts of the colored pattern (most of the examples seem to be somewhat aligned with this).\n\n---\n\n### Let's implement this now.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find coordinates of all non-zero cells\n    nonzero_coords = [(r, c) for r in range(len(grid)) for c in range(len(grid[0])) if grid[r][c] != 0]\n    \n    if not nonzero_coords:\n        # no colors, return 3x3 zero grid\n        return [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    min_r = min(r for r, _ in nonzero_coords)\n    max_r = max(r for r, _ in nonzero_coords)\n    min_c = min(c for _, c in nonzero_coords)\n    max_c = max(c for _, c in nonzero_coords)\n    \n    # Starting point for 3x3 crop is the top-left corner of bounding box\n    start_r = min_r\n    start_c = min_c\n    \n    # Make sure to crop a 3x3 area, pad with zeros if beyond grid borders\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for dr in range(3):\n        row = []\n        r = start_r + dr\n        for dc in range(3):\n            c = start_c + dc\n            if 0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0]):\n                row.append(grid[r][c])\n            else:\n                row.append(0)\n        transformed_grid.append(row)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"
