          "Analysis:\n\nFrom both the textual data and the visual examples, the pattern is:\n\n- Each input grid contains two vertical color strips on the left side of the grid, with three different colors arranged vertically.\n- Then there's a shape composed of a different color inside the grid to the right of these color strips.\n- In the output grid, each original color in the shape is replaced by the color of the vertical strip it crosses horizontally.\n- In other words, the shape \"inherits\" its colors from the closest vertical color strip directly to its left.\n\nLooking more closely at the examples:\n\n- In example 1:\n  - Left vertical strip colors are [8, 2] (from top to bottom).\n  - The shape is colored in 5s initially.\n  - Output: the 5s are replaced horizontally by the color of the vertical strip on the left that aligns with each row.\n- In example 2:\n  - Left strips: [9, 6, 4].\n  - Shape is colored in 5.\n  - Output: 5's replaced by the corresponding strip color on the left on each row.\n\nVisually, from the image, the vertical color strips are arranged on the left; the shape's color is replaced by the color of the vertical strip horizontally aligned to each row.\n\nFor the test input, the vertical color strips have 5 colors (2,3,4,7 in different rows). The shape will be recolored by corresponding strip colors horizontally.\n\n---\n\nImplementation:\n\n- The vertical strips appear in col=0, with a vertical division of three different colors (or more) down the first column.\n- The shape pixels are colored as 5 in the input.\n- Replace all pixels equal to 5 by the color of the strip on the left on the same row (column 0).\n- For pixels not equal to 5, keep their original value.\n- All other pixels stay as they are.\n- Output grid dimension is always 10x10.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Make a deep copy of grid for output\n    output = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for r in range(10):\n        strip_color = grid[r][0]\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                output[r][c] = strip_color\n    return output\n```"

              "Analysis:\n\nFrom both the textual data and the visual examples, the pattern is:\n\n- Each input grid contains two vertical color strips on the left side of the grid, with three different colors arranged vertically.\n- Then there's a shape composed of a different color inside the grid to the right of these color strips.\n- In the output grid, each original color in the shape is replaced by the color of the vertical strip it crosses horizontally.\n- In other words, the shape \"inherits\" its colors from the closest vertical color strip directly to its left.\n\nLooking more closely at the examples:\n\n- In example 1:\n  - Left vertical strip colors are [8, 2] (from top to bottom).\n  - The shape is colored in 5s initially.\n  - Output: the 5s are replaced horizontally by the color of the vertical strip on the left that aligns with each row.\n- In example 2:\n  - Left strips: [9, 6, 4].\n  - Shape is colored in 5.\n  - Output: 5's replaced by the corresponding strip color on the left on each row.\n\nVisually, from the image, the vertical color strips are arranged on the left; the shape's color is replaced by the color of the vertical strip horizontally aligned to each row.\n\nFor the test input, the vertical color strips have 5 colors (2,3,4,7 in different rows). The shape will be recolored by corresponding strip colors horizontally.\n\n---\n\nImplementation:\n\n- The vertical strips appear in col=0, with a vertical division of three different colors (or more) down the first column.\n- The shape pixels are colored as 5 in the input.\n- Replace all pixels equal to 5 by the color of the strip on the left on the same row (column 0).\n- For pixels not equal to 5, keep their original value.\n- All other pixels stay as they are.\n- Output grid dimension is always 10x10.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Make a deep copy of grid for output\n    output = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for r in range(10):\n        strip_color = grid[r][0]\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                output[r][c] = strip_color\n    return output\n```"
