          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. Let's take each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 4x8 grid (wait, no, wait. Wait, the input is 4 rows, each with 8 elements? Wait, the input for example 1 is given as 4 lines, each with 8 numbers. But the output is 4x4. Oh right, the input is 4x8, and the output is 4x4. Wait, but the problem says that the input is a 4x4 grid? Wait no, the problem says that the test input is a 4x4 grid. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the training examples' input and output are 4x4? Wait, looking at the first example:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 6 5 0 5 0\n6 0 0 0 5 5 0 0\n6 0 6 6 0 0 5 5\n0 0 6 0 0 5 5 0\n\nSo each input line is 8 numbers. So the input grid is 4x8? But the output is 4x4. So the transformation is from 4x8 to 4x4. Wait, but the problem says that the test input is a 4x4 grid. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem says that the input is a grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid. So maybe the training examples have input grids that are 4x4, but the way they are presented here is that each line is 8 numbers? Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the input is 4x4, but the way they are written is that each line is 8 numbers. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the input is 4x4, but the numbers are written as 8 elements per line? No, that's impossible. Wait, perhaps the input is 4x4, but the examples are written with 8 elements per line. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, maybe the input is 4x8, and the output is 4x4. But the problem says that the test input is a 4x4 grid. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement. The user says that the test input is shown for context. The test input is given as:\n\nTest Input:\n6 0 6 6 5 0 0 5\n0 0 0 6 5 5 5 5\n0 6 6 0 5 5 0 5\n6 6 0 0 5 5 5 0\n\nWhich is 4 lines, each with 8 numbers. So that's a 4x8 grid. But the output is supposed to be 4x4. So the transformation is from 4x8 to 4x4. But the problem says that the function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value. So the input grid is 4x8, and the output is 4x4. But the problem says that the function must return a 4x4 grid. So the input is 4x8, and the output is 4x4. So the function is supposed to take a 4x8 grid and output a 4x4 grid.\n\nBut the training examples' input is 4x8, and output is 4x4. So how do the transformations work?\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput is 4 rows, each with 8 numbers. Output is 4 rows, each with 4 numbers. So for each row in the input, we need to process 8 elements into 4 elements. Let's look at the first row of input: 6 6 6 6 5 0 5 0. The output first row is 0 0 0 0. Hmm. How does that happen?\n\nLooking at the output for example 1:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4\n0 4 0 0\n4 0 0 4\n\nSo for the first row of input, the output is all zeros. Maybe there's some pattern based on the original numbers. Let's think about the positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from some kind of grouping. For example, each output cell is determined by some combination of input cells. Let's think about how the output is generated.\n\nIn example 1, the first row of input is 6 6 6 6 5 0 5 0. The output first row is 0 0 0 0. Maybe the output is based on some condition. For instance, if the input cell is 5 or 0, then output is 0. But in the first row, the first four elements are 6, which are 6, but the output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions. For example, in the first row of the output, all zeros. Let's look at the input's first row. The first four elements are 6,6,6,6. The next four are 5,0,5,0. Maybe the output is based on some pattern of grouping. For example, maybe the output is determined by the sum of certain elements. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput:\n0 6 6 0 5 5 5 0\n0 6 0 6 5 0 0 5\n0 6 6 6 5 5 5 5\n6 0 0 0 0 5 0 5\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 4\n0 0 4 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0\n\nSo for the first row of input, the output is 0 0 0 4. Let's think: the input row is 0 6 6 0 5 5 5 0. Maybe the output is derived by some rule. For example, the first output cell is 0, then 0, then 0, then 4. Maybe the 4 comes from the fifth element (5) and sixth (5) and seventh (5) and eighth (0)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by some kind of pattern where certain positions are selected. For example, in the output, the fourth element is 4. Maybe in the input, the fifth element is 5, and the sixth is 5, and the seventh is 5, and the eighth is 0. Maybe the output is based on the presence of certain numbers. For example, if there's a 5 in the input, then the output is 4? But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 0 0 0 for the first row. Maybe the first row of the input has 6s and 5s and 0s. Maybe the output is based on the presence of 5s. But in the first row, there are 5s. But the output is all zeros. Hmm.\n\nLooking at example 3:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 0 5 0 5 5\n6 0 0 0 0 5 5 5\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 5 5 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0\n\nSo the third row of output is 0 4 4 4. The input third row is 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe the output is based on some condition. For example, in the third row of input, the fifth element is 0, sixth is 0, seventh is 0, eighth is 0. But the output is 0 4 4 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of certain numbers. For example, in the third row of input, the fifth element is 0, but the output third row is 0 4 4 4. Maybe the output is generated based on some pattern where if there's a 5 in the input, then the output is 4. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 4s in certain positions. Like the second row is 0 0 4 4. Maybe the 4s are generated when there's a 5 in the input. Or maybe the 4s are generated based on some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by grouping the input into 2x2 blocks. For example, the input is 4 rows of 8 elements. So each row is divided into 2x2 blocks, but since each row is 8 elements, that would be 4 blocks of 2 elements each. Then, for each block, some transformation is applied. But the output is 4x4, so perhaps each 2x2 block in the input is transformed into a single cell in the output. But that would require that the input is 4x8, and the output is 4x4. So each row of the input is divided into two 2-element groups, and then each group is transformed into a single element in the output row. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the positions where the input has 5s. For example, in example 1, the output has 4s where there are 5s. But in example 1, the first row of input has 5s in positions 5 and 7 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but the output is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by some kind of parity or adjacency. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a certain value, then it's transformed. But this is too vague.\n\nLooking at example 4:\n\nInput:\n6 0 6 0 0 0 5 5\n0 6 6 6 5 0 5 5\n6 6 0 6 5 0 5 5\n6 6 0 0 5 5 5 0\n\nOutput:\n0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4\n\nSo the output for the first row is 0 4 0 0. The input first row is 6 0 6 0 0 0 5 5. Maybe the 4 comes from the 5s in the input. For example, in the input, the 5s are in positions 6 and 7 (assuming 0-based?), but the output is 0 4 0 0. Maybe the 4 is generated when there's a 5 in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of 5s. For example, in the first row of input, there are two 5s (positions 6 and 7). The output first row is 0 4 0 0. Maybe the 4 is in the second position of the output. So maybe the 4 is generated when there's a 5 in the input. But how?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by looking at the positions where the input has 5s and 0s, and then applying some transformation. For example, if a cell is part of a group of 5s, then it's transformed to 4. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the second row is 0 0 4 4. The input's second row is 6 0 0 0 5 5 0 0. The 5s are in positions 4 and 5. So maybe the output is based on the presence of 5s in certain positions. For example, the second output cell is 4, which is in the third and fourth positions of the output row. Maybe the 4s are generated when there are 5s in the input's positions 4 and 5. But how does that map to the output positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the input's 5s and 0s, and for each 5, it's replaced by 4. But in example 1, the first row of input has 5s, but the output is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated based on the positions of 5s in the input. For example, if a cell in the input is 5, then the output cell is 4. But in example 1, the first row of input has 5s, but the output is all zeros. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that depends on the positions of the input cells. For example, in the output, the 4s appear in certain positions. Let's look at example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 4 4\nRow 2: 0 4 0 0\nRow 3: 4 0 0 4\n\nSo the 4s are in positions (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,0), (3,3). Maybe these positions are determined by some pattern. For example, the positions of the 4s in the output are in the second and third columns of row 1, first column of row 2, and third column of row 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the input's 5s and 0s, and for each 5, the output is 4. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation. For example, the output is derived from the input by applying a certain matrix operation. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as being generated by some rule based on the input's values. For example, if a cell in the input is 5, then the output cell is 4. But in example 1, the first row of input has 5s, but the output is all zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated based on the sum of certain cells. For example, if the sum of a group of cells is greater than a certain value, then the output cell is 4. But how to determine which cells to sum?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first row is all zeros. The input's first row is 6,6,6,6,5,0,5,0. Maybe the output is generated by some condition on the input's values. For instance, if the input cell is 6 or 5, then output is 0. But that doesn't fit because in the second row of the output, there are 4s. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the presence of 5s in the input. For example, in the output, 4s appear where there are 5s in the input. But in example 1, the first row of input has 5s, but the output is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs for all examples. Let's look for the positions where 4s appear.\n\nIn example 1: 4s are at (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,0), (3,3).\n\nIn example 2: output has 4s at (0,3), (1,2), (3,2).\n\nIn example 3: output has 4s at (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nIn example 4: output has 4s at (0,1), (3,3).\n\nHmm. It's not obvious. Let's think of the positions of the 4s in the output. For example, in example 1, the 4s are in positions that are diagonal or in certain patterns. Maybe the 4s are generated based on some pattern of the input's 5s. For example, in example 1, the 5s are in the input's first row (positions 4 and 6), second row (positions 4 and 5), third row (positions 4-7?), fourth row (positions 6 and 7). But how does that relate to the output positions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, each 5 in the input contributes to a 4 in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by some kind of grid transformation. For example, in the input, if there is a 5 in a certain position, then the output has a 4 in a certain position. But how to map that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the input's 5s and 0s, and for each 5, the output cell is 4, and for 0, it's 0. But in example 1, the first row has 5s but the output is all zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation based on the positions of the input's 5s. For example, the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is 4 if there's a 5 in the input's corresponding position. But how to map the input's 8 columns to 4 output columns.\n\nWait, the input is 4 rows of 8 columns, and the output is 4 rows of 4 columns. So maybe each output column is derived from two input columns. For example, for each output column, it's derived from two input columns. For instance, the first output column could be derived from the first two input columns, the second output column from columns 3 and 4, etc. But that's just a guess.\n\nLet me try this idea. For example, in example 1, the first output row is 0 0 0 0. Let's look at the first input row: 6 6 6 6 5 0 5 0. If each output column is derived from two input columns, then the first output column is columns 0 and 1 (6 and 6), second output column is columns 2 and 3 (6 and 6), third output column is columns 4 and 5 (5 and 0), fourth output column is columns 6 and 7 (5 and 0). But how does that lead to 0s in the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by some function of the two input columns. For example, if the two input columns are both 6, then output is 0. If one is 5 and the other is 0, then output is 0. But in example 1's first output row, all are zeros. But in example 2's first output row, the fourth column is 4. Let's see:\n\nExample 2's first input row is 0 6 6 0 5 5 5 0. So if the output columns are derived from pairs of input columns:\n\nOutput column 0: input columns 0 and 1: 0 and 6 \u2192 maybe 0?\n\nOutput column 1: input columns 2 and 3: 6 and 0 \u2192 maybe 0?\n\nOutput column 2: input columns 4 and 5: 5 and 5 \u2192 maybe 4?\n\nOutput column 3: input columns 6 and 7: 5 and 0 \u2192 maybe 4?\n\nBut the output for example 2's first row is 0 0 0 4. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the sum of the two input columns. For example, if the sum is 5, then output is 4. But in example 2's first row, columns 4 and 5 are 5 and 5 \u2192 sum 10. But the output is 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is determined by the presence of 5s in the input. For example, if there is a 5 in either of the two input columns, then the output is 4. But in example 1's first row, the first two input columns are 6 and 6 \u2192 no 5s, so output is 0. The third and fourth input columns are 6 and 6 \u2192 no 5s \u2192 output 0. The fifth and sixth input columns are 5 and 0 \u2192 has a 5 \u2192 output 4? But in example 1's first row, the output is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of 5s in the two input columns. For example, if there are two 5s, then output is 4. But in example 1's first row, the fifth and sixth columns are 5 and 0 \u2192 one 5, so output is 0. But in the first row of example 1's output, it's all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look at the output of example 1 and see if there's a pattern in the positions of the 4s. The 4s are in positions (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,0), (3,3). Let's see if these positions have any relation to the input's 5s. For example, in the input, the 5s are in positions (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,6), (3,7). Maybe the output's 4s are in positions that are diagonally related to the input's 5s. For example, the 4 in (1,2) could be related to the 5 in (1,4) or (1,5). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each output cell is determined by the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output cell at (i,j) is determined by the input cells in positions (i, 2j) and (i, 2j+1). Or maybe some other pattern.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and 0s and replacing them with 4s or 0s based on some rule. For example, in example 1, the first row of input has 5s, but the output is all zeros. However, the second row of output has 4s. Maybe the 4s are generated when there's a 5 in the input's row. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, if a cell in the input is 5, then the output cell is 4. But in example 1, the first row has 5s, but the output is all zeros. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by the number of 5s in the input's row. For example, if a row has at least one 5, then the output row is all zeros. But in example 1, the second row of output is 0 0 4 4, which contradicts that.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output for each example. Let's look at example 1's output. The output has 4s in certain positions. Maybe those positions are determined by the input's 5s in a way that depends on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation where each output cell is the sum of certain input cells. For example, each output cell is the sum of the input cells in a certain pattern. But how to determine which cells.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by some kind of grid where the 4s are placed in positions that are diagonally adjacent to the input's 5s. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at example 4's input and output. The input's first row is 6 0 6 0 0 0 5 5. The output is 0 4 0 0. The 4 is in the second position. Maybe that's because the input has 5s in positions 6 and 7. So perhaps the 4 is generated when there's a 5 in the input. But how to map that to the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, for each 5 in the input, the output has a 4 in a certain position. For example, if a 5 is in the input's position (i,j), then the output has a 4 in position (i//2, j//2). But let's check example 1.\n\nIn example 1, the input's first row has 5s at positions 4 and 6 (assuming 0-based). So for input position (0,4), the output would be (0//2, 4//2) = (0, 2). But in example 1's output, the second row (i=1) has 4s at positions 2 and 3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by some kind of grid where each output cell is derived from the input's cells in a 2x2 block. For example, each output cell is the sum of the input's 2x2 block. But since the input is 4x8, it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 5s in the input, and the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is 4 if there is a 5 in the corresponding 2x2 block of the input. But this is just a guess.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the first row of input is 6 6 6 6 5 0 5 0. The first two columns are 6,6,6,6. The next two columns are 5,0,5,0. The next two columns are 5,0,5,0. Wait, no. The input is 4 rows of 8 columns. So for the first row, the input is 8 columns. If we split into 2x2 blocks, each block would be 2 columns. But since the output is 4x4, maybe each output cell is derived from a 2x2 block of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking every other column of the input. For example, the output is 4x4, so each row of the input has 8 columns, which is 4 pairs. So for each output row, we take two columns from the input and process them into one output cell. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and 0s and replacing them with 4s or 0s based on some condition. For example, if the input has a 5 in a certain position, then the output has a 4 in a certain position.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern. Maybe I should try to find a transformation that works for at least some of the examples.\n\nLet me think about the output for example 1. The output has 4s in certain positions. For example, the second row of output is 0 0 4 4. The input's second row is 6 0 0 0 5 5 0 0. The 5s are in positions 4 and 5. Maybe these 5s are mapped to the third and fourth positions of the output row. So, for each row in the input, the output row is derived from the input's row by grouping the columns into pairs. For example, each pair of columns in the input is processed into a single output cell. So, for the second row of input, the pairs are [6,0], [0,0], [5,5], [0,0]. Then, for each pair, some transformation is applied. For example, if the pair contains a 5, the output cell is 4. Otherwise, it's 0. Let's see:\n\nFor the first pair [6,0], no 5s \u2192 0.\n\nSecond pair [0,0] \u2192 0.\n\nThird pair [5,5] \u2192 4.\n\nFourth pair [0,0] \u2192 0.\n\nBut the output for this row is 0 0 4 4. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because the third pair is [5,5], but the output is 4 and 4. So maybe each pair is transformed into two output cells. But that would make the output row have 4 cells, which fits. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair of input columns is transformed into one output cell. So, for example, the first pair is [6,0], which is transformed into 0. The second pair is [0,0], transformed into 0. The third pair is [5,5], transformed into 4. The fourth pair is [0,0], transformed into 0. But the output for this row is 0 0 4 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair of input columns is transformed into two output cells. For example, the first pair [6,0] is transformed into 0 and 0. The second pair [0,0] is 0 and 0. The third pair [5,5] is 4 and 4. The fourth pair [0,0] is 0 and 0. Then the output row would be 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 ... but that's not possible because the output is 4x4.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the output as being generated by some kind of transformation where each output cell is 4 if there's a 5 in the input's corresponding position, and 0 otherwise. But how to map the input's 8 columns to the output's 4 columns.\n\nWait, the input is 4x8, and the output is 4x4. So each output cell is derived from two input columns. Maybe the output is determined by the input's columns in pairs. For example, the first output column is derived from the first two input columns, the second output column from the next two, etc. But how to determine the value for each output cell.\n\nIn example 1, the first output row is 0 0 0 0. Let's look at the first two input columns: 6 and 6. Maybe if both are 6, the output is 0. The next two input columns are 6 and 6 \u2192 0. The next two are 5 and 0 \u2192 0. The last two are 5 and 0 \u2192 0. So all zeros. That fits the first output row.\n\nIn example 2, the first row of input is 0 6 6 0 5 5 5 0. The first two input columns are 0 and 6 \u2192 maybe 0. Next two are 6 and 0 \u2192 0. Next two are 5 and 5 \u2192 4. Last two are 5 and 0 \u2192 4. So the output row would be 0 0 4 4. But the example 2's output for the first row is 0 0 0 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, but maybe the transformation is different. For example, if the pair has at least one 5, then the output cell is 4. Otherwise, 0. Let's see:\n\nFor example 1's first row: the first two columns are 6 and 6 \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0. Next two 6 and 6 \u2192 0. Next two 5 and 0 \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4. Last two 5 and 0 \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4. So the output row would be 0 0 4 4. But the example 1's first row is 0 0 0 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the output is 0 0 0 0. So this suggests that the transformation is not based on the presence of 5s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the pair. For example, if the sum is greater than 5, then 4. Otherwise 0. Let's see:\n\nFor example 1's first row:\n\nFirst pair: 6+6=12 \u2192 4? But the output is 0.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is determined by the positions of the input's 5s and 0s in a way that depends on their positions. For example, if a 5 is in the input's even column, then the output is 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix where each output cell is the sum of the input's cells in certain positions. For example, for each output cell (i,j), it is the sum of the input's cells (i, 2j) and (i, 2j+1). If that sum is 5, then output is 4. Otherwise, 0. Let's test this for example 1's first row:\n\nFirst output cell (0,0): input cells (0,0) and (0,1) \u2192 6+6=12 \u2192 not 5 \u2192 0.\n\nSecond output cell (0,1): input cells (0,2) and (0,3) \u2192 6+6=12 \u2192 0.\n\nThird output cell (0,2): input cells (0,4) and (0,5) \u2192 5+0=5 \u2192 4.\n\nFourth output cell (0,3): input cells (0,6) and (0,7) \u2192 5+0=5 \u2192 4.\n\nBut the output for the first row is 0 0 0 0, not 0 0 4 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for some of the examples, even if not all.\n\nLooking at example 4's input and output:\n\nInput first row: 6 0 6 0 0 0 5 5 \u2192 output first row is 0 4 0 0.\n\nThe input's 5s are in positions 6 and 7. The output's second cell is 4. So maybe this is related to the 5s in the input's positions 6 and 7. If the output is determined by the positions of the 5s, maybe the output cell is 4 when the input has a 5 in the 6th or 7th column.\n\nBut how to map that to the output's columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the input's columns and for each column in the output, it's determined by some condition on the input's columns.\n\nFor example, in the output, the second column is 4 in example 4's first row. The input's columns 5 and 6 are 0 and 5. So maybe if there's a 5 in the input's column, the output is 4.\n\nBut how to determine which columns in the input correspond to which in the output.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0-3, 4-7, and for each pair, some transformation. For example, for each pair of input columns, if there's a 5, then the output is 4, otherwise 0.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the first pair (columns 0-1) are 6 and 6 \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0. Second pair (columns 2-3) are 6 and 6 \u2192 0. Third pair (columns 4-5) are 5 and 0 \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4. Fourth pair (columns 6-7) are 5 and 0 \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4. So the output would be 0 0 4 4. But in example 1's first row, the output is all zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the output is all zeros. So this suggests that the transformation is not based on the presence of 5s in the input's columns.\n\nMaybe the output is determined by the number of 5s in the input's row. For example, if there are two 5s in the row, then the output is 4. But in example 1's first row, there are two 5s, but the output is all zeros.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's think about the output for example 3. The output's third row is 0 4 4 4. The input's third row is 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the input has no 5s, but the output has 4s. This suggests that the presence of 5s is not the only factor.\n\nWait, in example 3's input, the third row is 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 4 4 4. So how does that happen? Maybe the output is determined by some other pattern, like the presence of 0s. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is determined by the input's values in a way that depends on their positions. For example, if the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 4, and if it's 0, then it's 0. But how to map the input's 8 columns to the output's 4 columns.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking every other column of the input, but in a way that depends on the position. For example, the first output column is derived from columns 0 and 1, the second from 2 and 3, etc. But how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0, 1, 2, 3, and then 4,5,6,7, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on what I can see. Let's try to find a pattern that works for at least some of the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output: the 4s are in positions that are diagonal or in certain patterns. Maybe the output is generated by looking at the positions of the input's 5s and 0s and replacing them with 4s or 0s based on their positions. For example, if a 5 is in an even column, then the output is 4 in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the following rule: for each cell in the output grid, if the corresponding input cell in the input grid is 5, then the output cell is 4. Otherwise, it's 0. But how to map the input's 8 columns to the output's 4 columns.\n\nMaybe the output is derived from the input's columns in pairs. For example, each output cell is determined by the input's columns in pairs. For example, for each output cell (i,j), it is determined by the input's columns 2j and 2j+1. But how.\n\nLet's try this for example 1. The first row of output is 0 0 0 0. Let's assume that each output cell is determined by the input's columns 2j and 2j+1. For example, for j=0, it's columns 0 and 1. For j=1, columns 2 and 3. For j=2, columns 4 and 5. For j=3, columns 6 and 7.\n\nIf the rule is: if the input's columns 2j and 2j+1 have at least one 5, then output is 4. Otherwise 0.\n\nFor example 1's first row:\n\nj=0: columns 0 and 1 are 6 and 6 \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0.\n\nj=1: columns 2 and 3 are 6 and 6 \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0.\n\nj=2: columns 4 and 5 are 5 and 0 \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4.\n\nj=3: columns 6 and 7 are 5 and 0 \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4.\n\nSo the output row would be 0 0 4 4. But in example 1, the first row is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1, the first row of output is 0 0 0 0. So this suggests that the rule is not based on the presence of 5s in the input's columns.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is determined by the input's values in a way that depends on their positions. For example, if the input's value is 5, then the output is 4. Otherwise, it's 0. But how to map the input's 8 columns to the output's 4 columns.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and for each output cell, it's the average of certain input cells. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each output cell is 4 if the input has a 5 in the corresponding position, and 0 otherwise. But how to map the input's 8 columns to the output's 4.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0-3, 4-7, and for each pair, if there is a 5 in the pair, then the output is 4. But this doesn't fit example 1's first row.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on what I can see. Let's try to implement a function that for each output cell (i,j), it looks at the input's columns 2j and 2j+1, and if either is 5, then output is 4, else 0. Let's see if this works for some examples.\n\nFor example 1's first row:\n\ncolumns 0-1: 6 and 6 \u2192 0.\n\ncolumns 2-3: 6 and 6 \u2192 0.\n\ncolumns 4-5: 5 and 0 \u2192 4.\n\ncolumns 6-7: 5 and 0 \u2192 4.\n\nSo the output row is 0 0 4 4. But example 1's first row is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the rule is different. Maybe it's based on the sum of the two input columns. For example, if the sum is 5, then output is 4. Otherwise 0.\n\nFor example 1's first row:\n\ncolumns 0-1: 6+6=12 \u2192 0.\n\ncolumns 2-3: 6+6=12 \u2192 0.\n\ncolumns 4-5: 5+0=5 \u2192 4.\n\ncolumns 6-7: 5+0=5 \u2192 4.\n\nSo the output row is 0 0 4 4. But example 1's first row is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is based on the product of the two input columns. For example, if the product is 5, then output is 4. Otherwise 0. But this is not likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of 5s in the input's row. For example, if there are two 5s in the row, then the output is 4. But example 1's first row has two 5s, but the output is all zeros.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to think of the output as being generated by some kind of transformation that replaces 5s with 4s and 0s with 0s, but in a way that depends on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and replacing them with 4s, and the 0s are replaced with 0s. But how to map the input's 8 columns to the output's 4 columns.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and for each output cell, it's the input's column 2j. But this would give a 4x4 grid where each output cell is from the input's columns 0, 2, 4, 6. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and for each output cell, it's the input's column 2j, and if it's 5, then output is 4, else 0. For example, in example 1's first row:\n\noutput cell (0,0) is input column 0 \u2192 6 \u2192 0.\n\noutput cell (0,1) is input column 2 \u2192 6 \u2192 0.\n\noutput cell (0,2) is input column 4 \u2192 5 \u2192 4.\n\noutput cell (0,3) is input column 6 \u2192 5 \u2192 4.\n\nSo the output row is 0 0 4 4. But example 1's first row is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the output is all zeros. So this suggests that the transformation is not based on this.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples that I can see. Let's look at example 4's output. The input's first row is 6 0 6 0 0 0 5 5. The output is 0 4 0 0. The 4 is in the second position. This could be because the input's columns 5 and 6 are 0 and 5, and the 5 is in column 6. Maybe the output is determined by the presence of 5 in the input's columns 6 and 7, and the output is 4 in the second position.\n\nBut how to map this to the output.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0-3, 4-7, and for each pair, if there is a 5 in the pair, then the output is 4. Otherwise 0. But this doesn't fit example 1's first row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0-3 and 4-7, and for each pair, if there is a 5 in the pair, then the output is 4. Otherwise 0. For example, in example 1's first row, the first pair is 6,6,6,6 \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0. The second pair is 5,0,5,0 \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4. So the output would be 0 4 0 4. But example 1's first row is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples and write a function that tries to implement a possible pattern. Let's assume that the output is generated by taking each pair of input columns and if there is at least one 5 in the pair, then the output cell is 4, otherwise 0. Let's see if this works for some examples.\n\nFor example 1's first row: pairs are [6,6], [6,6], [5,0], [5,0]. So the output would be 0 0 4 4. But the example's output is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each pair of input columns and if both are 5, then output is 4, otherwise 0. For example 1's first row: the third pair is [5,0] \u2192 not both 5 \u2192 0. Fourth pair [5,0] \u2192 0. So output is 0 0 0 0. This fits example 1's first row. Let's check this for other examples.\n\nExample 2's first row: input is 0 6 6 0 5 5 5 0. Pairs are [0,6], [6,0], [5,5], [5,0]. The third pair [5,5] \u2192 both 5 \u2192 4. The others are not both 5. So output would be 0 0 4 0. But the example 2's first row output is 0 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, but maybe the rule is different. For example, if the pair has at least one 5, then output is 4. But in example 1's first row, the third and fourth pairs have 5, so output would be 4 4. But the example's output is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess. Let's try to implement a function that for each output cell (i,j), it looks at the input's columns 2j and 2j+1. If both are 5, then output is 4, else 0. Let's see if this works for example 1.\n\nExample 1's first row: pairs are [6,6], [6,6], [5,0], [5,0]. All pairs have at least one 5, but not both. So output would be 0 0 0 0. Which fits example 1's first row.\n\nFor example 2's first row: pairs are [0,6], [6,0], [5,5], [5,0]. The third pair [5,5] \u2192 both 5 \u2192 output 4. The others are not both 5. So output row would be 0 0 4 0. But example 2's first row is 0 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the rule is that if the pair has at least one 5, then output is 4. For example 2's first row, the third pair [5,5] \u2192 4. The fourth pair [5,0] \u2192 4. So output would be 0 0 4 4. But example 2's first row is 0 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and 0s and replacing them with 4s and 0s based on some other condition.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and replacing them with 4s, and the 0s are replaced with 0s. But how to map the input's 8 columns to the output's 4 columns.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and for each output cell, it's the input's column 2j. So for example, the first output cell is input column 0, the second is input column 2, the third is input column 4, the fourth is input column 6. Then, if the input column is 5, output is 4, else 0.\n\nLet's test this for example 1's first row:\n\ninput columns 0: 6 \u2192 0.\n\ninput column 2: 6 \u2192 0.\n\ninput column 4: 5 \u2192 4.\n\ninput column 6: 5 \u2192 4.\n\nSo output row would be 0 0 4 4. But example 1's first row is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 3's third row of input is 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 4 4 4. So if the output is generated by taking input columns 0, 2, 4, 6, then for the third row:\n\ninput column 0: 6 \u2192 0.\n\ninput column 2: 0 \u2192 0.\n\ninput column 4: 0 \u2192 0.\n\ninput column 6: 0 \u2192 0.\n\nBut the output is 0 4 4 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess and write a function that tries to implement a possible pattern, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nBased on the first example, maybe the output is generated by taking each pair of input columns and if both are 5, then output is 4, else 0. Let's implement this.\n\nFor each row in the input, we process it into 4 output cells by grouping into pairs. For each pair, if both are 5, then output 4, else 0.\n\nLet's test this for example 1's first row: pairs are [6,6], [6,6], [5,0], [5,0]. All pairs have at least one 5, but not both. So output is 0 0 0 0. Which fits.\n\nFor example 2's first row: [0,6], [6,0], [5,5], [5,0]. The third pair is [5,5] \u2192 both 5 \u2192 4. The fourth pair is [5,0] \u2192 not both 5 \u2192 0. So output would be 0 0 4 0. But example 2's first row is 0 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the rule is that if the pair has at least one 5, then output is 4. For example 2's first row, the third pair [5,5] \u2192 4, fourth pair [5,0] \u2192 4. So output would be 0 0 4 4. But the example's output is 0 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best guess I have. Let's assume that the output is generated by taking each pair of input columns and if both are 5, then output is 4, else 0. This fits example 1's first row.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\nThe function would take each row of the input, split into pairs of two columns, and for each pair, check if both are 5. If yes, output 4, else 0.\n\nSo, for each row in the input grid, we process it as follows:\n\noutput_row = []\nfor j in 0 to 3:\n    col1 = input_row[2*j]\n    col2 = input_row[2*j + 1]\n    if col1 == 5 and col2 == 5:\n        output_row.append(4)\n    else:\n        output_row.append(0)\nreturn the output grid.\n\nLet's test this for example 1's first row: [6,6,6,6,5,0,5,0]. Pairs are [6,6], [6,6], [5,0], [5,0]. All are not both 5. So output is 0 0 0 0. Which fits.\n\nFor example 1's second row: [6,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]. Pairs are [6,0], [0,0], [5,5], [0,0]. The third pair is [5,5] \u2192 4. So output row is 0 0 4 0. But example 1's second row is 0 0 4 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's second row, the output is 0 0 4 4. So this suggests that the rule is not based on both being 5.\n\nBut this is the best I can think of. Maybe the rule is that if the pair has at least one 5, then output is 4. Let's try that.\n\nFor example 1's second row: pairs are [6,0], [0,0], [5,5], [0,0]. The third pair has 5, so output is 4. The first pair has no 5, second has no, fourth has no. So output row is 0 0 4 0. But example 1's second row is 0 0 4 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's second row, the output is 0 0 4 4. So maybe the fourth pair has a 5. But the fourth pair is [0,0], which has no 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible guess, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Let's implement the rule where each output cell is 4 if the pair of input columns has at least one 5, else 0. Let's see.\n\nFor example 1's second row: [6,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]. Pairs are [6,0] \u2192 has 0 \u2192 no 5? No, 6 and 0. No 5. So 0. Next pair [0,0] \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0. Next pair [5,5] \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4. Next pair [0,0] \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0. So output row is 0 0 4 0. But example 1's output is 0 0 4 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the rule is that if the pair has at least one 5, then output is 4, but for some reason, the fourth pair in example 1's second row is [0,0], but the output is 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. I think I'll have to proceed with the initial guess, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Let's write the code for the rule where each output cell is 4 if the pair of input columns has both 5, else 0.\n\nHere's the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        output_row = []\n        for j in range(4):\n            col1 = row[2*j]\n            col2 = row[2*j + 1]\n            if col1 == 5 and col2 == 5:\n                output_row.append(4)\n            else:\n                output_row.append(0)\n        transformed.append(output_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut let's test this for example 1's second row: [6,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]. Pairs are [6,0], [0,0], [5,5], [0,0]. The third pair is [5,5] \u2192 4. So output row is [0, 0, 4, 0]. But example 1's output is [0, 0, 4, 4]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the rule is that if the pair has at least one 5, then output is 4. Let's try that.\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        output_row = []\n        for j in range(4):\n            col1 = row[2*j]\n            col2 = row[2*j + 1]\n            if col1 == 5 or col2 == 5:\n                output_row.append(4)\n            else:\n                output_row.append(0)\n        transformed.append(output_row)\n    return transformed\n\nLet's test this for example 1's first row: [6,6,6,6,5,0,5,0]. Pairs are [6,6] \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0. [6,6] \u2192 0. [5,0] \u2192 5 \u2192 4. [5,0] \u2192 5 \u2192 4. So output row is 0 0 4 4. But example 1's output is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut example 1's output is 0 0 0 0 for the first row. So this suggests that this rule is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible guess, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Maybe the correct pattern is that the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and replacing them with 4s, and the 0s with 0s, but in a way that depends on their positions.\n\nBut how to map this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and replacing them with 4s, and the 0s with 0s, but only for certain positions.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent on this, I'll proceed with the code that checks for the presence of 5 in the pair and sets the output to 4, even if it doesn't fit all examples. This is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. Let's take each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 4x8 grid (wait, no, wait. Wait, the input is 4 rows, each with 8 elements? Wait, the input for example 1 is given as 4 lines, each with 8 numbers. But the output is 4x4. Oh right, the input is 4x8, and the output is 4x4. Wait, but the problem says that the input is a 4x4 grid? Wait no, the problem says that the test input is a 4x4 grid. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the training examples' input and output are 4x4? Wait, looking at the first example:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 6 5 0 5 0\n6 0 0 0 5 5 0 0\n6 0 6 6 0 0 5 5\n0 0 6 0 0 5 5 0\n\nSo each input line is 8 numbers. So the input grid is 4x8? But the output is 4x4. So the transformation is from 4x8 to 4x4. Wait, but the problem says that the test input is a 4x4 grid. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem says that the input is a grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid. So maybe the training examples have input grids that are 4x4, but the way they are presented here is that each line is 8 numbers? Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the input is 4x4, but the way they are written is that each line is 8 numbers. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the input is 4x4, but the numbers are written as 8 elements per line? No, that's impossible. Wait, perhaps the input is 4x4, but the examples are written with 8 elements per line. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, maybe the input is 4x8, and the output is 4x4. But the problem says that the test input is a 4x4 grid. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement. The user says that the test input is shown for context. The test input is given as:\n\nTest Input:\n6 0 6 6 5 0 0 5\n0 0 0 6 5 5 5 5\n0 6 6 0 5 5 0 5\n6 6 0 0 5 5 5 0\n\nWhich is 4 lines, each with 8 numbers. So that's a 4x8 grid. But the output is supposed to be 4x4. So the transformation is from 4x8 to 4x4. But the problem says that the function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value. So the input grid is 4x8, and the output is 4x4. But the problem says that the function must return a 4x4 grid. So the input is 4x8, and the output is 4x4. So the function is supposed to take a 4x8 grid and output a 4x4 grid.\n\nBut the training examples' input is 4x8, and output is 4x4. So how do the transformations work?\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput is 4 rows, each with 8 numbers. Output is 4 rows, each with 4 numbers. So for each row in the input, we need to process 8 elements into 4 elements. Let's look at the first row of input: 6 6 6 6 5 0 5 0. The output first row is 0 0 0 0. Hmm. How does that happen?\n\nLooking at the output for example 1:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4\n0 4 0 0\n4 0 0 4\n\nSo for the first row of input, the output is all zeros. Maybe there's some pattern based on the original numbers. Let's think about the positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from some kind of grouping. For example, each output cell is determined by some combination of input cells. Let's think about how the output is generated.\n\nIn example 1, the first row of input is 6 6 6 6 5 0 5 0. The output first row is 0 0 0 0. Maybe the output is based on some condition. For instance, if the input cell is 5 or 0, then output is 0. But in the first row, the first four elements are 6, which are 6, but the output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions. For example, in the first row of the output, all zeros. Let's look at the input's first row. The first four elements are 6,6,6,6. The next four are 5,0,5,0. Maybe the output is based on some pattern of grouping. For example, maybe the output is determined by the sum of certain elements. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput:\n0 6 6 0 5 5 5 0\n0 6 0 6 5 0 0 5\n0 6 6 6 5 5 5 5\n6 0 0 0 0 5 0 5\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 4\n0 0 4 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0\n\nSo for the first row of input, the output is 0 0 0 4. Let's think: the input row is 0 6 6 0 5 5 5 0. Maybe the output is derived by some rule. For example, the first output cell is 0, then 0, then 0, then 4. Maybe the 4 comes from the fifth element (5) and sixth (5) and seventh (5) and eighth (0)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by some kind of pattern where certain positions are selected. For example, in the output, the fourth element is 4. Maybe in the input, the fifth element is 5, and the sixth is 5, and the seventh is 5, and the eighth is 0. Maybe the output is based on the presence of certain numbers. For example, if there's a 5 in the input, then the output is 4? But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 0 0 0 for the first row. Maybe the first row of the input has 6s and 5s and 0s. Maybe the output is based on the presence of 5s. But in the first row, there are 5s. But the output is all zeros. Hmm.\n\nLooking at example 3:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 0 5 0 5 5\n6 0 0 0 0 5 5 5\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 5 5 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0\n\nSo the third row of output is 0 4 4 4. The input third row is 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe the output is based on some condition. For example, in the third row of input, the fifth element is 0, sixth is 0, seventh is 0, eighth is 0. But the output is 0 4 4 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of certain numbers. For example, in the third row of input, the fifth element is 0, but the output third row is 0 4 4 4. Maybe the output is generated based on some pattern where if there's a 5 in the input, then the output is 4. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 4s in certain positions. Like the second row is 0 0 4 4. Maybe the 4s are generated when there's a 5 in the input. Or maybe the 4s are generated based on some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by grouping the input into 2x2 blocks. For example, the input is 4 rows of 8 elements. So each row is divided into 2x2 blocks, but since each row is 8 elements, that would be 4 blocks of 2 elements each. Then, for each block, some transformation is applied. But the output is 4x4, so perhaps each 2x2 block in the input is transformed into a single cell in the output. But that would require that the input is 4x8, and the output is 4x4. So each row of the input is divided into two 2-element groups, and then each group is transformed into a single element in the output row. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the positions where the input has 5s. For example, in example 1, the output has 4s where there are 5s. But in example 1, the first row of input has 5s in positions 5 and 7 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but the output is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by some kind of parity or adjacency. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a certain value, then it's transformed. But this is too vague.\n\nLooking at example 4:\n\nInput:\n6 0 6 0 0 0 5 5\n0 6 6 6 5 0 5 5\n6 6 0 6 5 0 5 5\n6 6 0 0 5 5 5 0\n\nOutput:\n0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4\n\nSo the output for the first row is 0 4 0 0. The input first row is 6 0 6 0 0 0 5 5. Maybe the 4 comes from the 5s in the input. For example, in the input, the 5s are in positions 6 and 7 (assuming 0-based?), but the output is 0 4 0 0. Maybe the 4 is generated when there's a 5 in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of 5s. For example, in the first row of input, there are two 5s (positions 6 and 7). The output first row is 0 4 0 0. Maybe the 4 is in the second position of the output. So maybe the 4 is generated when there's a 5 in the input. But how?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by looking at the positions where the input has 5s and 0s, and then applying some transformation. For example, if a cell is part of a group of 5s, then it's transformed to 4. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the second row is 0 0 4 4. The input's second row is 6 0 0 0 5 5 0 0. The 5s are in positions 4 and 5. So maybe the output is based on the presence of 5s in certain positions. For example, the second output cell is 4, which is in the third and fourth positions of the output row. Maybe the 4s are generated when there are 5s in the input's positions 4 and 5. But how does that map to the output positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the input's 5s and 0s, and for each 5, it's replaced by 4. But in example 1, the first row of input has 5s, but the output is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated based on the positions of 5s in the input. For example, if a cell in the input is 5, then the output cell is 4. But in example 1, the first row of input has 5s, but the output is all zeros. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that depends on the positions of the input cells. For example, in the output, the 4s appear in certain positions. Let's look at example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 4 4\nRow 2: 0 4 0 0\nRow 3: 4 0 0 4\n\nSo the 4s are in positions (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,0), (3,3). Maybe these positions are determined by some pattern. For example, the positions of the 4s in the output are in the second and third columns of row 1, first column of row 2, and third column of row 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the input's 5s and 0s, and for each 5, the output is 4. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation. For example, the output is derived from the input by applying a certain matrix operation. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as being generated by some rule based on the input's values. For example, if a cell in the input is 5, then the output cell is 4. But in example 1, the first row of input has 5s, but the output is all zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated based on the sum of certain cells. For example, if the sum of a group of cells is greater than a certain value, then the output cell is 4. But how to determine which cells to sum?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first row is all zeros. The input's first row is 6,6,6,6,5,0,5,0. Maybe the output is generated by some condition on the input's values. For instance, if the input cell is 6 or 5, then output is 0. But that doesn't fit because in the second row of the output, there are 4s. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the presence of 5s in the input. For example, in the output, 4s appear where there are 5s in the input. But in example 1, the first row of input has 5s, but the output is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs for all examples. Let's look for the positions where 4s appear.\n\nIn example 1: 4s are at (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,0), (3,3).\n\nIn example 2: output has 4s at (0,3), (1,2), (3,2).\n\nIn example 3: output has 4s at (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nIn example 4: output has 4s at (0,1), (3,3).\n\nHmm. It's not obvious. Let's think of the positions of the 4s in the output. For example, in example 1, the 4s are in positions that are diagonal or in certain patterns. Maybe the 4s are generated based on some pattern of the input's 5s. For example, in example 1, the 5s are in the input's first row (positions 4 and 6), second row (positions 4 and 5), third row (positions 4-7?), fourth row (positions 6 and 7). But how does that relate to the output positions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, each 5 in the input contributes to a 4 in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by some kind of grid transformation. For example, in the input, if there is a 5 in a certain position, then the output has a 4 in a certain position. But how to map that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the input's 5s and 0s, and for each 5, the output cell is 4, and for 0, it's 0. But in example 1, the first row has 5s but the output is all zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation based on the positions of the input's 5s. For example, the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is 4 if there's a 5 in the input's corresponding position. But how to map the input's 8 columns to 4 output columns.\n\nWait, the input is 4 rows of 8 columns, and the output is 4 rows of 4 columns. So maybe each output column is derived from two input columns. For example, for each output column, it's derived from two input columns. For instance, the first output column could be derived from the first two input columns, the second output column from columns 3 and 4, etc. But that's just a guess.\n\nLet me try this idea. For example, in example 1, the first output row is 0 0 0 0. Let's look at the first input row: 6 6 6 6 5 0 5 0. If each output column is derived from two input columns, then the first output column is columns 0 and 1 (6 and 6), second output column is columns 2 and 3 (6 and 6), third output column is columns 4 and 5 (5 and 0), fourth output column is columns 6 and 7 (5 and 0). But how does that lead to 0s in the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by some function of the two input columns. For example, if the two input columns are both 6, then output is 0. If one is 5 and the other is 0, then output is 0. But in example 1's first output row, all are zeros. But in example 2's first output row, the fourth column is 4. Let's see:\n\nExample 2's first input row is 0 6 6 0 5 5 5 0. So if the output columns are derived from pairs of input columns:\n\nOutput column 0: input columns 0 and 1: 0 and 6 \u2192 maybe 0?\n\nOutput column 1: input columns 2 and 3: 6 and 0 \u2192 maybe 0?\n\nOutput column 2: input columns 4 and 5: 5 and 5 \u2192 maybe 4?\n\nOutput column 3: input columns 6 and 7: 5 and 0 \u2192 maybe 4?\n\nBut the output for example 2's first row is 0 0 0 4. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the sum of the two input columns. For example, if the sum is 5, then output is 4. But in example 2's first row, columns 4 and 5 are 5 and 5 \u2192 sum 10. But the output is 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is determined by the presence of 5s in the input. For example, if there is a 5 in either of the two input columns, then the output is 4. But in example 1's first row, the first two input columns are 6 and 6 \u2192 no 5s, so output is 0. The third and fourth input columns are 6 and 6 \u2192 no 5s \u2192 output 0. The fifth and sixth input columns are 5 and 0 \u2192 has a 5 \u2192 output 4? But in example 1's first row, the output is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of 5s in the two input columns. For example, if there are two 5s, then output is 4. But in example 1's first row, the fifth and sixth columns are 5 and 0 \u2192 one 5, so output is 0. But in the first row of example 1's output, it's all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look at the output of example 1 and see if there's a pattern in the positions of the 4s. The 4s are in positions (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,0), (3,3). Let's see if these positions have any relation to the input's 5s. For example, in the input, the 5s are in positions (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,6), (3,7). Maybe the output's 4s are in positions that are diagonally related to the input's 5s. For example, the 4 in (1,2) could be related to the 5 in (1,4) or (1,5). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each output cell is determined by the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output cell at (i,j) is determined by the input cells in positions (i, 2j) and (i, 2j+1). Or maybe some other pattern.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and 0s and replacing them with 4s or 0s based on some rule. For example, in example 1, the first row of input has 5s, but the output is all zeros. However, the second row of output has 4s. Maybe the 4s are generated when there's a 5 in the input's row. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, if a cell in the input is 5, then the output cell is 4. But in example 1, the first row has 5s, but the output is all zeros. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by the number of 5s in the input's row. For example, if a row has at least one 5, then the output row is all zeros. But in example 1, the second row of output is 0 0 4 4, which contradicts that.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output for each example. Let's look at example 1's output. The output has 4s in certain positions. Maybe those positions are determined by the input's 5s in a way that depends on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix transformation where each output cell is the sum of certain input cells. For example, each output cell is the sum of the input cells in a certain pattern. But how to determine which cells.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by some kind of grid where the 4s are placed in positions that are diagonally adjacent to the input's 5s. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at example 4's input and output. The input's first row is 6 0 6 0 0 0 5 5. The output is 0 4 0 0. The 4 is in the second position. Maybe that's because the input has 5s in positions 6 and 7. So perhaps the 4 is generated when there's a 5 in the input. But how to map that to the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, for each 5 in the input, the output has a 4 in a certain position. For example, if a 5 is in the input's position (i,j), then the output has a 4 in position (i//2, j//2). But let's check example 1.\n\nIn example 1, the input's first row has 5s at positions 4 and 6 (assuming 0-based). So for input position (0,4), the output would be (0//2, 4//2) = (0, 2). But in example 1's output, the second row (i=1) has 4s at positions 2 and 3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by some kind of grid where each output cell is derived from the input's cells in a 2x2 block. For example, each output cell is the sum of the input's 2x2 block. But since the input is 4x8, it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 5s in the input, and the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is 4 if there is a 5 in the corresponding 2x2 block of the input. But this is just a guess.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the first row of input is 6 6 6 6 5 0 5 0. The first two columns are 6,6,6,6. The next two columns are 5,0,5,0. The next two columns are 5,0,5,0. Wait, no. The input is 4 rows of 8 columns. So for the first row, the input is 8 columns. If we split into 2x2 blocks, each block would be 2 columns. But since the output is 4x4, maybe each output cell is derived from a 2x2 block of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking every other column of the input. For example, the output is 4x4, so each row of the input has 8 columns, which is 4 pairs. So for each output row, we take two columns from the input and process them into one output cell. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and 0s and replacing them with 4s or 0s based on some condition. For example, if the input has a 5 in a certain position, then the output has a 4 in a certain position.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern. Maybe I should try to find a transformation that works for at least some of the examples.\n\nLet me think about the output for example 1. The output has 4s in certain positions. For example, the second row of output is 0 0 4 4. The input's second row is 6 0 0 0 5 5 0 0. The 5s are in positions 4 and 5. Maybe these 5s are mapped to the third and fourth positions of the output row. So, for each row in the input, the output row is derived from the input's row by grouping the columns into pairs. For example, each pair of columns in the input is processed into a single output cell. So, for the second row of input, the pairs are [6,0], [0,0], [5,5], [0,0]. Then, for each pair, some transformation is applied. For example, if the pair contains a 5, the output cell is 4. Otherwise, it's 0. Let's see:\n\nFor the first pair [6,0], no 5s \u2192 0.\n\nSecond pair [0,0] \u2192 0.\n\nThird pair [5,5] \u2192 4.\n\nFourth pair [0,0] \u2192 0.\n\nBut the output for this row is 0 0 4 4. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because the third pair is [5,5], but the output is 4 and 4. So maybe each pair is transformed into two output cells. But that would make the output row have 4 cells, which fits. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair of input columns is transformed into one output cell. So, for example, the first pair is [6,0], which is transformed into 0. The second pair is [0,0], transformed into 0. The third pair is [5,5], transformed into 4. The fourth pair is [0,0], transformed into 0. But the output for this row is 0 0 4 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pair of input columns is transformed into two output cells. For example, the first pair [6,0] is transformed into 0 and 0. The second pair [0,0] is 0 and 0. The third pair [5,5] is 4 and 4. The fourth pair [0,0] is 0 and 0. Then the output row would be 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 ... but that's not possible because the output is 4x4.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the output as being generated by some kind of transformation where each output cell is 4 if there's a 5 in the input's corresponding position, and 0 otherwise. But how to map the input's 8 columns to the output's 4 columns.\n\nWait, the input is 4x8, and the output is 4x4. So each output cell is derived from two input columns. Maybe the output is determined by the input's columns in pairs. For example, the first output column is derived from the first two input columns, the second output column from the next two, etc. But how to determine the value for each output cell.\n\nIn example 1, the first output row is 0 0 0 0. Let's look at the first two input columns: 6 and 6. Maybe if both are 6, the output is 0. The next two input columns are 6 and 6 \u2192 0. The next two are 5 and 0 \u2192 0. The last two are 5 and 0 \u2192 0. So all zeros. That fits the first output row.\n\nIn example 2, the first row of input is 0 6 6 0 5 5 5 0. The first two input columns are 0 and 6 \u2192 maybe 0. Next two are 6 and 0 \u2192 0. Next two are 5 and 5 \u2192 4. Last two are 5 and 0 \u2192 4. So the output row would be 0 0 4 4. But the example 2's output for the first row is 0 0 0 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, but maybe the transformation is different. For example, if the pair has at least one 5, then the output cell is 4. Otherwise, 0. Let's see:\n\nFor example 1's first row: the first two columns are 6 and 6 \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0. Next two 6 and 6 \u2192 0. Next two 5 and 0 \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4. Last two 5 and 0 \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4. So the output row would be 0 0 4 4. But the example 1's first row is 0 0 0 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the output is 0 0 0 0. So this suggests that the transformation is not based on the presence of 5s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the pair. For example, if the sum is greater than 5, then 4. Otherwise 0. Let's see:\n\nFor example 1's first row:\n\nFirst pair: 6+6=12 \u2192 4? But the output is 0.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is determined by the positions of the input's 5s and 0s in a way that depends on their positions. For example, if a 5 is in the input's even column, then the output is 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of matrix where each output cell is the sum of the input's cells in certain positions. For example, for each output cell (i,j), it is the sum of the input's cells (i, 2j) and (i, 2j+1). If that sum is 5, then output is 4. Otherwise, 0. Let's test this for example 1's first row:\n\nFirst output cell (0,0): input cells (0,0) and (0,1) \u2192 6+6=12 \u2192 not 5 \u2192 0.\n\nSecond output cell (0,1): input cells (0,2) and (0,3) \u2192 6+6=12 \u2192 0.\n\nThird output cell (0,2): input cells (0,4) and (0,5) \u2192 5+0=5 \u2192 4.\n\nFourth output cell (0,3): input cells (0,6) and (0,7) \u2192 5+0=5 \u2192 4.\n\nBut the output for the first row is 0 0 0 0, not 0 0 4 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for some of the examples, even if not all.\n\nLooking at example 4's input and output:\n\nInput first row: 6 0 6 0 0 0 5 5 \u2192 output first row is 0 4 0 0.\n\nThe input's 5s are in positions 6 and 7. The output's second cell is 4. So maybe this is related to the 5s in the input's positions 6 and 7. If the output is determined by the positions of the 5s, maybe the output cell is 4 when the input has a 5 in the 6th or 7th column.\n\nBut how to map that to the output's columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the input's columns and for each column in the output, it's determined by some condition on the input's columns.\n\nFor example, in the output, the second column is 4 in example 4's first row. The input's columns 5 and 6 are 0 and 5. So maybe if there's a 5 in the input's column, the output is 4.\n\nBut how to determine which columns in the input correspond to which in the output.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0-3, 4-7, and for each pair, some transformation. For example, for each pair of input columns, if there's a 5, then the output is 4, otherwise 0.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the first pair (columns 0-1) are 6 and 6 \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0. Second pair (columns 2-3) are 6 and 6 \u2192 0. Third pair (columns 4-5) are 5 and 0 \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4. Fourth pair (columns 6-7) are 5 and 0 \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4. So the output would be 0 0 4 4. But in example 1's first row, the output is all zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the output is all zeros. So this suggests that the transformation is not based on the presence of 5s in the input's columns.\n\nMaybe the output is determined by the number of 5s in the input's row. For example, if there are two 5s in the row, then the output is 4. But in example 1's first row, there are two 5s, but the output is all zeros.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's think about the output for example 3. The output's third row is 0 4 4 4. The input's third row is 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the input has no 5s, but the output has 4s. This suggests that the presence of 5s is not the only factor.\n\nWait, in example 3's input, the third row is 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 4 4 4. So how does that happen? Maybe the output is determined by some other pattern, like the presence of 0s. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is determined by the input's values in a way that depends on their positions. For example, if the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 4, and if it's 0, then it's 0. But how to map the input's 8 columns to the output's 4 columns.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking every other column of the input, but in a way that depends on the position. For example, the first output column is derived from columns 0 and 1, the second from 2 and 3, etc. But how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0, 1, 2, 3, and then 4,5,6,7, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on what I can see. Let's try to find a pattern that works for at least some of the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output: the 4s are in positions that are diagonal or in certain patterns. Maybe the output is generated by looking at the positions of the input's 5s and 0s and replacing them with 4s or 0s based on their positions. For example, if a 5 is in an even column, then the output is 4 in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the following rule: for each cell in the output grid, if the corresponding input cell in the input grid is 5, then the output cell is 4. Otherwise, it's 0. But how to map the input's 8 columns to the output's 4 columns.\n\nMaybe the output is derived from the input's columns in pairs. For example, each output cell is determined by the input's columns in pairs. For example, for each output cell (i,j), it is determined by the input's columns 2j and 2j+1. But how.\n\nLet's try this for example 1. The first row of output is 0 0 0 0. Let's assume that each output cell is determined by the input's columns 2j and 2j+1. For example, for j=0, it's columns 0 and 1. For j=1, columns 2 and 3. For j=2, columns 4 and 5. For j=3, columns 6 and 7.\n\nIf the rule is: if the input's columns 2j and 2j+1 have at least one 5, then output is 4. Otherwise 0.\n\nFor example 1's first row:\n\nj=0: columns 0 and 1 are 6 and 6 \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0.\n\nj=1: columns 2 and 3 are 6 and 6 \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0.\n\nj=2: columns 4 and 5 are 5 and 0 \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4.\n\nj=3: columns 6 and 7 are 5 and 0 \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4.\n\nSo the output row would be 0 0 4 4. But in example 1, the first row is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1, the first row of output is 0 0 0 0. So this suggests that the rule is not based on the presence of 5s in the input's columns.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is determined by the input's values in a way that depends on their positions. For example, if the input's value is 5, then the output is 4. Otherwise, it's 0. But how to map the input's 8 columns to the output's 4 columns.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and for each output cell, it's the average of certain input cells. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each output cell is 4 if the input has a 5 in the corresponding position, and 0 otherwise. But how to map the input's 8 columns to the output's 4.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0-3, 4-7, and for each pair, if there is a 5 in the pair, then the output is 4. But this doesn't fit example 1's first row.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on what I can see. Let's try to implement a function that for each output cell (i,j), it looks at the input's columns 2j and 2j+1, and if either is 5, then output is 4, else 0. Let's see if this works for some examples.\n\nFor example 1's first row:\n\ncolumns 0-1: 6 and 6 \u2192 0.\n\ncolumns 2-3: 6 and 6 \u2192 0.\n\ncolumns 4-5: 5 and 0 \u2192 4.\n\ncolumns 6-7: 5 and 0 \u2192 4.\n\nSo the output row is 0 0 4 4. But example 1's first row is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the rule is different. Maybe it's based on the sum of the two input columns. For example, if the sum is 5, then output is 4. Otherwise 0.\n\nFor example 1's first row:\n\ncolumns 0-1: 6+6=12 \u2192 0.\n\ncolumns 2-3: 6+6=12 \u2192 0.\n\ncolumns 4-5: 5+0=5 \u2192 4.\n\ncolumns 6-7: 5+0=5 \u2192 4.\n\nSo the output row is 0 0 4 4. But example 1's first row is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is based on the product of the two input columns. For example, if the product is 5, then output is 4. Otherwise 0. But this is not likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of 5s in the input's row. For example, if there are two 5s in the row, then the output is 4. But example 1's first row has two 5s, but the output is all zeros.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to think of the output as being generated by some kind of transformation that replaces 5s with 4s and 0s with 0s, but in a way that depends on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and replacing them with 4s, and the 0s are replaced with 0s. But how to map the input's 8 columns to the output's 4 columns.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and for each output cell, it's the input's column 2j. But this would give a 4x4 grid where each output cell is from the input's columns 0, 2, 4, 6. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and for each output cell, it's the input's column 2j, and if it's 5, then output is 4, else 0. For example, in example 1's first row:\n\noutput cell (0,0) is input column 0 \u2192 6 \u2192 0.\n\noutput cell (0,1) is input column 2 \u2192 6 \u2192 0.\n\noutput cell (0,2) is input column 4 \u2192 5 \u2192 4.\n\noutput cell (0,3) is input column 6 \u2192 5 \u2192 4.\n\nSo the output row is 0 0 4 4. But example 1's first row is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the output is all zeros. So this suggests that the transformation is not based on this.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples that I can see. Let's look at example 4's output. The input's first row is 6 0 6 0 0 0 5 5. The output is 0 4 0 0. The 4 is in the second position. This could be because the input's columns 5 and 6 are 0 and 5, and the 5 is in column 6. Maybe the output is determined by the presence of 5 in the input's columns 6 and 7, and the output is 4 in the second position.\n\nBut how to map this to the output.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0-3, 4-7, and for each pair, if there is a 5 in the pair, then the output is 4. Otherwise 0. But this doesn't fit example 1's first row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0-3 and 4-7, and for each pair, if there is a 5 in the pair, then the output is 4. Otherwise 0. For example, in example 1's first row, the first pair is 6,6,6,6 \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0. The second pair is 5,0,5,0 \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4. So the output would be 0 4 0 4. But example 1's first row is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples and write a function that tries to implement a possible pattern. Let's assume that the output is generated by taking each pair of input columns and if there is at least one 5 in the pair, then the output cell is 4, otherwise 0. Let's see if this works for some examples.\n\nFor example 1's first row: pairs are [6,6], [6,6], [5,0], [5,0]. So the output would be 0 0 4 4. But the example's output is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each pair of input columns and if both are 5, then output is 4, otherwise 0. For example 1's first row: the third pair is [5,0] \u2192 not both 5 \u2192 0. Fourth pair [5,0] \u2192 0. So output is 0 0 0 0. This fits example 1's first row. Let's check this for other examples.\n\nExample 2's first row: input is 0 6 6 0 5 5 5 0. Pairs are [0,6], [6,0], [5,5], [5,0]. The third pair [5,5] \u2192 both 5 \u2192 4. The others are not both 5. So output would be 0 0 4 0. But the example 2's first row output is 0 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, but maybe the rule is different. For example, if the pair has at least one 5, then output is 4. But in example 1's first row, the third and fourth pairs have 5, so output would be 4 4. But the example's output is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess. Let's try to implement a function that for each output cell (i,j), it looks at the input's columns 2j and 2j+1. If both are 5, then output is 4, else 0. Let's see if this works for example 1.\n\nExample 1's first row: pairs are [6,6], [6,6], [5,0], [5,0]. All pairs have at least one 5, but not both. So output would be 0 0 0 0. Which fits example 1's first row.\n\nFor example 2's first row: pairs are [0,6], [6,0], [5,5], [5,0]. The third pair [5,5] \u2192 both 5 \u2192 output 4. The others are not both 5. So output row would be 0 0 4 0. But example 2's first row is 0 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the rule is that if the pair has at least one 5, then output is 4. For example 2's first row, the third pair [5,5] \u2192 4. The fourth pair [5,0] \u2192 4. So output would be 0 0 4 4. But example 2's first row is 0 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and 0s and replacing them with 4s and 0s based on some other condition.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and replacing them with 4s, and the 0s are replaced with 0s. But how to map the input's 8 columns to the output's 4 columns.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and for each output cell, it's the input's column 2j. So for example, the first output cell is input column 0, the second is input column 2, the third is input column 4, the fourth is input column 6. Then, if the input column is 5, output is 4, else 0.\n\nLet's test this for example 1's first row:\n\ninput columns 0: 6 \u2192 0.\n\ninput column 2: 6 \u2192 0.\n\ninput column 4: 5 \u2192 4.\n\ninput column 6: 5 \u2192 4.\n\nSo output row would be 0 0 4 4. But example 1's first row is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 3's third row of input is 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 4 4 4. So if the output is generated by taking input columns 0, 2, 4, 6, then for the third row:\n\ninput column 0: 6 \u2192 0.\n\ninput column 2: 0 \u2192 0.\n\ninput column 4: 0 \u2192 0.\n\ninput column 6: 0 \u2192 0.\n\nBut the output is 0 4 4 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess and write a function that tries to implement a possible pattern, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nBased on the first example, maybe the output is generated by taking each pair of input columns and if both are 5, then output is 4, else 0. Let's implement this.\n\nFor each row in the input, we process it into 4 output cells by grouping into pairs. For each pair, if both are 5, then output 4, else 0.\n\nLet's test this for example 1's first row: pairs are [6,6], [6,6], [5,0], [5,0]. All pairs have at least one 5, but not both. So output is 0 0 0 0. Which fits.\n\nFor example 2's first row: [0,6], [6,0], [5,5], [5,0]. The third pair is [5,5] \u2192 both 5 \u2192 4. The fourth pair is [5,0] \u2192 not both 5 \u2192 0. So output would be 0 0 4 0. But example 2's first row is 0 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the rule is that if the pair has at least one 5, then output is 4. For example 2's first row, the third pair [5,5] \u2192 4, fourth pair [5,0] \u2192 4. So output would be 0 0 4 4. But the example's output is 0 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best guess I have. Let's assume that the output is generated by taking each pair of input columns and if both are 5, then output is 4, else 0. This fits example 1's first row.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\nThe function would take each row of the input, split into pairs of two columns, and for each pair, check if both are 5. If yes, output 4, else 0.\n\nSo, for each row in the input grid, we process it as follows:\n\noutput_row = []\nfor j in 0 to 3:\n    col1 = input_row[2*j]\n    col2 = input_row[2*j + 1]\n    if col1 == 5 and col2 == 5:\n        output_row.append(4)\n    else:\n        output_row.append(0)\nreturn the output grid.\n\nLet's test this for example 1's first row: [6,6,6,6,5,0,5,0]. Pairs are [6,6], [6,6], [5,0], [5,0]. All are not both 5. So output is 0 0 0 0. Which fits.\n\nFor example 1's second row: [6,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]. Pairs are [6,0], [0,0], [5,5], [0,0]. The third pair is [5,5] \u2192 4. So output row is 0 0 4 0. But example 1's second row is 0 0 4 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's second row, the output is 0 0 4 4. So this suggests that the rule is not based on both being 5.\n\nBut this is the best I can think of. Maybe the rule is that if the pair has at least one 5, then output is 4. Let's try that.\n\nFor example 1's second row: pairs are [6,0], [0,0], [5,5], [0,0]. The third pair has 5, so output is 4. The first pair has no 5, second has no, fourth has no. So output row is 0 0 4 0. But example 1's second row is 0 0 4 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's second row, the output is 0 0 4 4. So maybe the fourth pair has a 5. But the fourth pair is [0,0], which has no 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible guess, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Let's implement the rule where each output cell is 4 if the pair of input columns has at least one 5, else 0. Let's see.\n\nFor example 1's second row: [6,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]. Pairs are [6,0] \u2192 has 0 \u2192 no 5? No, 6 and 0. No 5. So 0. Next pair [0,0] \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0. Next pair [5,5] \u2192 has 5 \u2192 4. Next pair [0,0] \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0. So output row is 0 0 4 0. But example 1's output is 0 0 4 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the rule is that if the pair has at least one 5, then output is 4, but for some reason, the fourth pair in example 1's second row is [0,0], but the output is 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. I think I'll have to proceed with the initial guess, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Let's write the code for the rule where each output cell is 4 if the pair of input columns has both 5, else 0.\n\nHere's the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        output_row = []\n        for j in range(4):\n            col1 = row[2*j]\n            col2 = row[2*j + 1]\n            if col1 == 5 and col2 == 5:\n                output_row.append(4)\n            else:\n                output_row.append(0)\n        transformed.append(output_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut let's test this for example 1's second row: [6,0,0,0,5,5,0,0]. Pairs are [6,0], [0,0], [5,5], [0,0]. The third pair is [5,5] \u2192 4. So output row is [0, 0, 4, 0]. But example 1's output is [0, 0, 4, 4]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the rule is that if the pair has at least one 5, then output is 4. Let's try that.\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        output_row = []\n        for j in range(4):\n            col1 = row[2*j]\n            col2 = row[2*j + 1]\n            if col1 == 5 or col2 == 5:\n                output_row.append(4)\n            else:\n                output_row.append(0)\n        transformed.append(output_row)\n    return transformed\n\nLet's test this for example 1's first row: [6,6,6,6,5,0,5,0]. Pairs are [6,6] \u2192 no 5 \u2192 0. [6,6] \u2192 0. [5,0] \u2192 5 \u2192 4. [5,0] \u2192 5 \u2192 4. So output row is 0 0 4 4. But example 1's output is 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut example 1's output is 0 0 0 0 for the first row. So this suggests that this rule is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible guess, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Maybe the correct pattern is that the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and replacing them with 4s, and the 0s with 0s, but in a way that depends on their positions.\n\nBut how to map this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and replacing them with 4s, and the 0s with 0s, but only for certain positions.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent on this, I'll proceed with the code that checks for the presence of 5 in the pair and sets the output to 4, even if it doesn't fit all examples. This is the best I can do.\n"
