          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that maps the input grids to the output grids in these examples. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 1. The input is a 12x6 grid, and the output is a 3x6 grid. Wait, the output is 3 rows, each with 6 elements. So the transformation reduces the number of rows from 12 to 3. But how?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1:\n\nInput rows 0-11 (since it's 12 rows), output is 3 rows. Maybe the output is derived from combining certain rows of the input. For example, maybe the first three rows of the input are combined into the first output row? But the output has 3 rows, each with 6 elements. Let me check the first output row of Example 1: 2 5 5 5 5 2. The input's first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 1: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nBut the output first row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the output is derived from some kind of transformation on the input rows. Alternatively, maybe the output is a combination of certain columns or patterns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1: each output row is 6 elements. The input has 12 rows, so maybe each output row is derived from 4 input rows? But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a compressed version of the input. For example, each output row is formed by taking certain elements from the input. Let's think about the first output row of Example 1. The output is 2 5 5 5 5 2. Looking at the input rows, perhaps the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements of some rows. For example, maybe the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first three input rows? Wait, the first input row is 0 5 5 5 5 0. The first and last elements are 0 and 0. But the output first row starts with 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that's not directly based on the input rows. Let me look for other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output. The input is 12 rows again, output is 3 rows. The output rows are 5 5 4 5 5 5, 0 5 8 5 8 5, 2 4 2 5 5 4.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 2:\n\nFirst input rows:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow 1: 0 5 0 5 0 5\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 5 0\nRow 3: 0 4 4 0 4 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 4\nRow 5: 0 4 0 4 0 4\nRow 6: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 9: 8 0 8 8 8 8\nRow 10: 0 0 8 8 8 8\nRow 11: 0 0 0 8 0 0\n\nThe output is 3 rows. Let's see the first output row: 5 5 4 5 5 5. The first input row is 5 5 0 5 5 5. The output first row's first two elements are 5 and 5, which match the first two elements of the first input row. The third element is 4. Looking at the input row 3 (row 3 is 0 4 4 0 4 0), the third element is 4. Maybe the third element is taken from row 3? Then the fourth element is 5. The fourth element of the first input row is 5. The fifth element is 5, which is the same as the first input row. The sixth element is 5. So maybe the first output row is combining elements from the first input row and some other rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is derived from combining certain rows. For example, the first output row could be formed by taking the first row of the input, then some other rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for each example. The output is 3 rows of 6 elements each. The input for each example is 12 rows of 6 elements each. So perhaps the output is derived by taking some combination of the input rows. For example, each output row is made from 4 input rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output rows might be formed by taking certain columns from the input. But the input has 6 columns, and the output has 6 columns. So that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input's rows in a way that each output row is derived from 4 input rows. For example, the first output row could be the first, second, third, and fourth input rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1. The first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. Looking at the input rows, perhaps the 2s are from the 8th row (row 8 in input) of the input. Let me check the input for Example 1:\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 1: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 4 0 0 0\nRow 4: 4 0 4 4 4 0\nRow 5: 4 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 2 0 2 2 0 2\nRow 7: 2 0 0 0 0 2\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 9: 0 8 0 8 0 0\nRow 10: 0 8 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 8 0 8 0 0\n\nThe output first row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. The first element is 2, which is from row 6, column 0. The second element is 5, which is from row 1, column 0. The third element is 5, from row 1, column 1. The fourth element is 5, from row 1, column 3. The fifth is 5, from row 1, column 4. The sixth is 2, from row 6, column 5. So maybe the output is combining elements from different rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by taking certain positions. For example, the output rows are formed by taking certain columns from the input. But the output has 6 columns, same as the input. So perhaps each output row is a combination of certain rows of the input.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 1. The first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. The second output row is 5 5 4 5 5 5. The third is 5 5 0 5 0 0. Let's look at the input rows. The first output row's first element is 2. Looking at row 6 (input row 6) which is 2 0 2 2 0 2. The first element is 2. The second element of the output row is 5. Looking at row 1, first element is 5. Third element is 5, from row 1, column 1. Fourth element is 5, from row 1, column 3. Fifth is 5, from row 1, column 4. Sixth is 2, from row 6, column 5. So maybe the first output row is taking elements from row 1 and row 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are derived from the input's rows in a way that each output row is formed by combining certain parts of the input. For example, the first output row could be formed by taking the first and last elements of certain rows. But this is not clear.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the third output row is 5 5 0 5 0 0. Looking at the input's rows. The third output row could be from row 2 (input row 2) which is 5 5 0 5 0 0. So that's the same as the input row 2. But that's only possible if the output is taking some of the input rows directly. But in that case, the output would have 12 rows, but it's 3 rows. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input. For example, in Example 1, the output is 3 rows, which could be the 6th, 7th, and 8th rows of the input. Let me check:\n\nInput row 6: 2 0 2 2 0 2\nRow 7: 2 0 0 0 0 2\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut the output rows are different. The first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the outputs. For example, in Example 1, the first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. The second output row is 5 5 4 5 5 5. The third is 5 5 0 5 0 0. Looking at these rows, the first two elements are 2 and 5, then 5 and 5, then 5 and 5. Then the third element varies. Maybe the first two elements are derived from certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the third output row is the same as the input row 2. So maybe the output is derived by taking certain rows from the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by taking every fourth row. For example, input has 12 rows. 12 divided by 4 is 3. So output rows could be rows 0, 4, 8. Let's check:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 4: 4 0 4 4 4 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut the output rows are not matching. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the output is derived from the input by taking certain columns. For example, the output's columns are derived from the input's columns. But the output has 6 columns, same as input. So maybe each output row is formed by combining certain columns from the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the output. For example, in the first output row of Example 1, the first and last elements are 2. In the input, row 6 has 2 in the first and last columns. Maybe the output is taking the first and last elements of certain rows and combining them. For example, the first output row is formed by combining the first and last elements of row 6, and some other elements.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1's first row: 2 5 5 5 5 2. The second element is 5, which is from row 1, column 0. The third element is 5, from row 1, column 1. Fourth is 5, from row 1, column 3. Fifth is 5, from row 1, column 4. Sixth is 2, from row 6, column 5. So maybe the first output row is combining elements from row 1 and row 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of row 6, the first column of row 1, then some other columns, then the last column of row 6. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns across multiple examples. For example, in Example 1, the third output row is the same as the input row 2. In Example 2, the third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. Looking at the input for Example 2's row 6: 2 2 2 0 0 0. So that's not matching. But in Example 2's output, the third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. Maybe this is derived from combining elements from row 6 and row 7. Row 6 is 2 2 2 0 0 0, row 7 is 0 2 2 0 2 0. So combining elements from these rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking certain elements from the input's rows. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from certain rows and the middle elements from others.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as being derived from the input by some transformation that involves taking the first and last elements of certain rows and combining them. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs for all examples. The output is always 3 rows. Let me check the outputs for all examples:\n\nExample 1: 3 rows.\nExample 2: 3 rows.\nExample 3: 3 rows.\nExample 4: 3 rows.\nExample 5: 3 rows.\nExample 6: 3 rows.\nTest input: 3 rows.\n\nSo the transformation is from 12 rows to 3 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input. For example, each output row is formed by combining 4 input rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking the first 3 rows of the input, then the next 3 rows, then the next 3 rows. But that would give 3 rows of 6 elements each, but the output is 3 rows. Wait, but the input is 12 rows. So maybe each output row is formed by combining 4 input rows. For example, the first output row is formed by combining the first four input rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input, then the next three rows, then the next three rows. But that would be 3 rows of 6 elements each. But that's not possible. Because each input row is 6 elements, and the output is 3 rows of 6 elements each. So maybe the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input, but that would be 3 rows of 6 elements each. But the output for example 1 is 3 rows, but the input has 12 rows. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth columns of the input's rows. But that's not helpful.\n\nAnother observation: the output for each example has 3 rows. The input has 12 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the first row of the input, then the third row, then the fifth row. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1's third row: 5 5 0 5 0 0. This is the same as the input row 2. So maybe the third output row is the input row 2. Similarly, for Example 2's third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. Looking at the input for Example 2, row 6 is 2 2 2 0 0 0. Row 7 is 0 2 2 0 2 0. Row 8 is 2 2 2 0 2 0. Maybe the third output row is formed by combining row 6, 7, and 8 in some way. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input's rows. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from row 6, and the middle elements from other rows.\n\nAlternatively, think about the outputs as being derived from the input by some kind of pattern that involves taking certain elements from the input's rows. For example, in Example 1's first output row, the first and last elements are 2, which are from row 6. The middle elements are 5, which are from row 1. So maybe the first output row is combining row 6 and row 1 in some way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being a compressed version of the input. For example, each output row is a combination of certain input rows. For example, the first output row is the first row of the input, then the second row, then the third row, but with some transformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by taking certain columns. For example, the output's first row is the first column of the input's rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. But that's not helpful.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Let's try to look for a pattern that can be applied across all examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs for all examples, they have 3 rows. The input is 12 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking every fourth row of the input. For example, rows 0, 4, 8. Let's check Example 1:\n\nInput rows 0, 4, 8:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 4: 4 0 4 4 4 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut the output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 5 5 5 5 2\nRow 1: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nSo this doesn't match. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the first row of the input, then the third row, then the fifth row. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by taking certain positions. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of the input's rows 6, 1, 7, 2, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, each output row has 6 elements. The input has 6 columns. So maybe each output row is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking columns 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 0 of certain rows. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by taking the first row of the input, then the second row, then the third row. But that would be 3 rows, but the input has 12 rows. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother observation: looking at the outputs for all examples, the first output row seems to have a pattern of 2s and 5s. For example, in Example 1, the first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. In Example 2, the first output row is 5 5 4 5 5 5. In Example 3, the first output row is 5 8 5 4 8 4. In Example 4, the first output row is 5 5 5 5 4 4. In Example 5, it's 5 4 8 4 4 4. In Example 6, it's 4 5 2 5 5 4. So there's no clear pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, each output row has a certain pattern. For example, the first output row of Example 1 has 2 at the start and end. The first output row of Example 6 has 4 at the start and end. Maybe the first and last elements of the output rows are derived from certain positions in the input.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1's first row: 2 5 5 5 5 2. The 2s are from row 6 of the input. Row 6 is 2 0 2 2 0 2. So first and last elements are 2. So maybe the first and last elements of the output rows are taken from the input's row 6, 7, or 8.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2's first output row, the first two elements are 5 and 5. Looking at the input row 0: 5 5 0 5 5 5. So first two elements are 5 and 5. So maybe the first output row is derived from the first input row.\n\nBut how does that fit with other examples?\n\nIn Example 3's first output row: 5 8 5 4 8 4. The first element is 5, which is from input row 0 (5 0 5 0 0 0). The second element is 8, which is from input row 9 (8 8 0 8 8 8). So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of certain operations, like taking certain rows or columns, or applying some kind of pattern.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs for all examples, the output rows are derived from the input by taking certain positions. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements of certain rows and combining them with other elements.\n\nAlternatively, think about the outputs as being derived from the input by some kind of averaging or pattern matching. But without more examples, this is hard.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the pattern in the outputs. For example, in Example 1, the first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. The second output row is 5 5 4 5 5 5. The third is 5 5 0 5 0 0. Looking at these, the first two elements are 2 and 5, then 5 and 5, then 5 and 5. The third element varies. Maybe the first two elements are derived from certain rows, and the rest are derived from others.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs for all examples, each output row has 6 elements. The input has 6 columns. Maybe each output row is formed by taking certain columns from the input's rows. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and third columns of certain rows. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the input by taking the first and last elements of certain rows, and the middle elements from others. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements of row 6, and the middle elements from row 1.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to take from?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs for all examples, and trying to find a common pattern. For example, in all examples, the output has 3 rows. The input has 12 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking every fourth row of the input. Let's check:\n\nFor Example 1, rows 0, 4, 8:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 4: 4 0 4 4 4 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut the output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 5 5 5 5 2\nRow 1: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nThese don't match. So this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the rows 6, 7, 8. Let's see:\n\nRow 6: 2 0 2 2 0 2\nRow 7: 2 0 0 0 0 2\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut the output for Example 1 is different. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the first output row is derived from the first three rows of the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first element of each of the first three rows, then the second, etc. But that would give 3 elements per row, but the output has 6 elements. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by combining elements from different rows. For example, the first output row is formed by combining elements from row 1, row 6, and row 7. But this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern that is common across all examples. For example, in all examples, the output has three rows, and each row has six elements. The input has 12 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by the first row of the input, the second output row is formed by the second row, and the third output row is formed by the third row. But that would mean the output is the first three rows of the input, but that's not the case for the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first row of the input, then the third row, then the fifth row. Let's check Example 1:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\nRow 4: 4 0 4 4 4 0\n\nBut the output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 5 5 5 5 2\nRow 1: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nSo the third output row matches row 2 of the input. The first output row is not matching row 0. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the third output row is the same as the input row 2. In Example 2, the third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. Looking at the input for Example 2, row 6 is 2 2 2 0 0 0, row 7 is 0 2 2 0 2 0, row 8 is 2 2 2 0 2 0. Maybe the third output row is formed by combining elements from these rows. For example, the first two elements are 2 and 4. Looking at row 6, first element is 2. Row 7, second element is 2. Row 8, first element is 2. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output row is formed by taking the first, third, and fifth elements from certain rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let me look at the outputs for all examples and see if there's a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: 2 5 5 5 5 2\nRow 1: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nRow 2 is the same as input row 2. So maybe the third output row is the third input row. Similarly, in Example 2's output, the third row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. Let's see the input for Example 2:\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\n\nMaybe the third output row is formed by combining these three rows. For example, the first element is 2 (from row 6), the second is 4 (maybe from row 7 or 8?), but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output row is derived from the input's rows 6, 7, 8. Let's try to combine them:\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\n\nCombining these, maybe the third output row is formed by taking the first element from row 6, the second from row 7, the third from row 8, and so on. But that would give:\n\nRow 6: 2, row 7: 2, row 8: 2 \u2192 2 2 2 ... but the output is 2 4 2 5 5 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output row is formed by taking certain elements from these rows. For example, the first element is 2 (from row 6), the second is 2 (from row 7), the third is 2 (from row 8), but that doesn't match the output.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should think of the transformation as taking certain positions from the input's rows. For example, the output rows are formed by taking the first and last elements of certain rows and combining them with other elements.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, each output row has a certain pattern. For example, the first output row of Example 1 starts with 2 and ends with 2. This suggests that the first and last elements are taken from the input's row 6. Row 6 in Example 1 is 2 0 2 2 0 2. So the first and last elements are 2. So maybe the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from row 6 and the middle elements from row 1.\n\nRow 1 in Example 1 is 5 5 0 5 5 5. So the middle elements are 5, 5, 5, 5. So combining the first and last elements from row 6 (2, 2) and the middle elements from row 1 (5, 5, 5, 5), but how? The output row has 6 elements: 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2. So the first element is 2 (from row 6), second is 5 (from row 1), third is 5 (from row 1), fourth is 5 (from row 1), fifth is 5 (from row 1), sixth is 2 (from row 6). So this seems to be the case.\n\nSo for the first output row of Example 1, it's taking the first element from row 6, then the second, third, fourth, fifth elements from row 1, and the sixth element from row 6.\n\nSo the first output row is formed by taking the first and sixth elements from row 6, and the second to fifth elements from row 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the second output row of Example 1: 5 5 4 5 5 5. Let's see. This could be formed by taking the first two elements from row 1 (5,5), the third element from row 3 (4), and the fourth to sixth elements from row 1 (5,5,5). So row 3 is 0 0 4 0 0 0. So third element is 4. So the second output row is formed by taking first two elements from row 1, third from row 3, and the rest from row 1.\n\nFor the third output row, it's the same as row 2 of the input.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is taking certain rows from the input and combining them in specific ways.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- The first output row is formed by taking the first and sixth elements from row 6, and the second to fifth elements from row 1.\n- The second output row is formed by taking the first two elements from row 1, the third element from row 3, and the fourth to sixth elements from row 1.\n- The third output row is the same as row 2 of the input.\n\nBut this is specific to Example 1. How to generalize this to other examples?\n\nLet me check Example 2. The output for Example 2 is:\n\n5 5 4 5 5 5\n0 5 8 5 8 5\n2 4 2 5 5 4\n\nLet's see the input for Example 2:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow 1: 0 5 0 5 0 5\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 5 0\nRow 3: 0 4 4 0 4 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 4\nRow 5: 0 4 0 4 0 4\nRow 6: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 9: 8 0 8 8 8 8\nRow 10: 0 0 8 8 8 8\nRow 11: 0 0 0 8 0 0\n\nThe first output row is 5 5 4 5 5 5. This could be formed by taking the first two elements from row 0 (5,5), the third element from row 3 (4), and the fourth to sixth elements from row 0 (5,5,5). So that's 5,5,4,5,5,5.\n\nThe second output row is 0 5 8 5 8 5. This could be formed by taking the first element from row 1 (0), the second from row 1 (5), the third from row 9 (8), and the fourth to sixth from row 1 (5,8,5)? Wait, row 1 is 0 5 0 5 0 5. So fourth element is 5, fifth is 0, sixth is 5. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the third element is from row 9. Row 9 is 8 0 8 8 8 8. So third element is 8. So the second output row is formed by taking first element from row 1 (0), second from row 1 (5), third from row 9 (8), fourth from row 1 (5), fifth from row 9 (8), sixth from row 1 (5). That gives 0 5 8 5 8 5, which matches.\n\nThe third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. This could be formed by taking the first element from row 6 (2), the second from row 7 (2), third from row 8 (2), but that would give 2 2 2 ... which doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's formed by taking elements from rows 6, 7, 8. For example, first element from row 6 (2), second from row 7 (2), third from row 8 (2), but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the third output row is formed by taking elements from row 6, row 7, and row 8. For example, the first element is 2 (row 6), second is 4 (from row 7?), but row 7 is 0 2 2 0 2 0. So no. Alternatively, maybe the third output row is formed by taking certain elements from rows 6, 7, 8. For example:\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\n\nCombining these, maybe the third output row is formed by taking the first element from row 6 (2), the second from row 7 (2), the third from row 8 (2), and then the fourth from row 6 (0), fifth from row 7 (2), sixth from row 8 (0). But that gives 2 2 2 0 2 0, which doesn't match. So this is not the case.\n\nBut the third output row for Example 2 is 2 4 2 5 5 4. Let's see if this can be derived from rows 6, 7, 8. For example, first element 2 (row 6), second element 4 (maybe from row 9?), but row 9 is 8 0 8 8 8 8. So that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the third output row is formed by taking elements from row 6, row 7, and row 9. For example, first element from row 6 (2), second from row 7 (2), third from row 9 (8), but that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output row is formed by taking the first element from row 6 (2), the second from row 7 (2), the third from row 8 (2), and the fourth from row 6 (0), fifth from row 7 (2), sixth from row 8 (0). But that gives 2 2 2 0 2 0, which is not matching. \n\nThis is not working. So maybe the pattern is not consistent across all examples, but I need to find a general rule.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the third output row is the same as the input row 2. In Example 2, the third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. Looking at the input rows 6, 7, 8:\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\n\nIf we take the first element from row 6 (2), the second from row 7 (2), the third from row 8 (2), then the fourth from row 6 (0), fifth from row 7 (2), sixth from row 8 (0), we get 2 2 2 0 2 0. But the output is 2 4 2 5 5 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output row is formed by taking elements from row 6, row 9, and row 10. Row 9 is 8 0 8 8 8 8. Row 10 is 0 0 8 8 8 8. So taking first element from row 6 (2), second from row 9 (8), third from row 10 (8), but that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should think of the transformation as taking certain rows from the input and modifying them in a specific way.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows are derived from the input by taking the first three rows, then the next three rows, then the next three rows. But the output has three rows, so each output row is derived from a group of three input rows. For example, the first output row is derived from the first three input rows, the second from the next three, and the third from the next three.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first three input rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 1: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nThe first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. This doesn't match the first three rows. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows are derived from the input by taking certain elements from the input rows. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from row 6, and the middle elements from row 1. The second output row is formed by taking the first two elements from row 1, the third from row 3, and the rest from row 1. The third output row is row 2 of the input.\n\nIf this pattern is followed, then for other examples, the same logic applies. For example, in Example 2, the first output row is formed by taking the first two elements from row 0 (5,5), the third from row 3 (4), and the rest from row 0. This gives 5 5 4 5 5 5, which matches the first output row.\n\nThe second output row is formed by taking the first element from row 1 (0), the second from row 1 (5), the third from row 9 (8), and the fourth from row 1 (5), fifth from row 9 (8), sixth from row 1 (5). This gives 0 5 8 5 8 5, which matches.\n\nThe third output row is row 2 of the input. But in Example 2, the third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. But row 2 of the input is 0 0 0 5 5 0. So this doesn't match. So this pattern is not consistent.\n\nBut in Example 1, the third output row is row 2 of the input. In Example 2, it's not. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe the transformation is to take the first three rows of the input and modify them in some way. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input and applying a certain transformation. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first row of the input, then the second row, then the third row. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, each output row has 6 elements. The input has 6 columns. So perhaps each output row is formed by taking certain columns from the input's rows. For example, the first output row is formed by taking columns 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2 from certain rows.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I need to make an educated guess. Based on the first example, the transformation seems to involve taking certain rows and combining their elements in specific ways. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from row 6, and the middle elements from row 1. The second output row is formed by taking first two elements from row 1, third from row 3, and the rest from row 1. The third output row is row 2 of the input.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation could be:\n\n- Output row 0: take first element from row 6, then elements 1-4 from row 1, then sixth element from row 6.\n- Output row 1: take elements 0-1 from row 1, element 2 from row 3, elements 3-5 from row 1.\n- Output row 2: take row 2 of the input.\n\nBut this is specific to Example 1. How to generalize this?\n\nIn Example 2, the first output row is formed by taking elements 0-1 from row 0, element 2 from row 3, and elements 3-5 from row 0. The second output row is formed by taking elements 0 from row 1, element 1 from row 1, element 2 from row 9, elements 3-5 from row 1. The third output row is not row 2, but something else.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation varies between examples. So this approach is not general.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input, then applying a transformation to them. For example, the first output row is the first row of the input, the second is the second, and the third is the third. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first row of the input, then the third row, then the fifth row. But this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. However, looking at the outputs, it seems that the third output row is often the same as the input's row 2. For example, in Example 1, it's row 2. In Example 2, it's not, but in Example 3, let's check.\n\nExample 3's input is 12 rows. Output is 3 rows. The third output row is 5 8 5 4 8 4. Let's check the input for Example 3:\n\nRow 2: 5 0 5 0 5 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 4 0 4\nRow 4: 0 0 0 4 0 0\nRow 5: 4 0 0 4 0 4\nRow 6: 0 0 2 0 0 2\nRow 7: 2 2 0 2 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 0 0 0 2\nRow 9: 8 8 0 8 8 8\nRow 10: 8 8 8 8 8 0\nRow 11: 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\nThe third output row is 5 8 5 4 8 4. This could be formed by taking elements from row 9 and row 10. For example, row 9 is 8 8 0 8 8 8. Row 10 is 8 8 8 8 8 0. So combining these, maybe the third output row is formed by taking elements from row 9 and row 10.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see. The most consistent part is that the third output row is often the same as the input's row 2. So perhaps the third output row is always the input's row 2. But this is not true for Example 2, where the third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4, and row 2 of the input is 0 0 0 5 5 0.\n\nSo this is not the case.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has 3 rows, and the input has 12 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking every fourth row of the input. For example, rows 0, 4, 8. But this doesn't match the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking rows 6, 7, 8. Let's check for Example 1: rows 6, 7, 8 are:\n\nRow 6: 2 0 2 2 0 2\nRow 7: 2 0 0 0 0 2\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nThe output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 5 5 5 5 2\nRow 1: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nThese don't match. So this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that involves taking certain rows and combining their elements. Based on the first example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from row 6 and the middle elements from row 1. The second output row is formed by taking the first two elements from row 1, the third from row 3, and the rest from row 1. The third output row is row 2 of the input.\n\nSo for the general case, the transformation might be:\n\n- Output row 0: take first element from row 6, then elements 1-4 from row 1, then sixth element from row 6.\n- Output row 1: take elements 0-1 from row 1, element 2 from row 3, elements 3-5 from row 1.\n- Output row 2: take row 2 of the input.\n\nBut this is specific to Example 1. For other examples, this might not hold, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would need to:\n\n- For the first output row, take elements from row 6 and row 1.\n- For the second output row, take elements from row 1 and row 3.\n- For the third output row, take row 2 of the input.\n\nBut this is just for Example 1. How to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking row 6, the second output row is formed by taking row 1 and row 3, and the third output row is row 2.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and write the code based on this.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Assume grid is a list of 12 rows, each with 6 elements\n    # Output is 3 rows of 6 elements each\n    # Output row 0: first element from row 6, elements 1-4 from row 1, sixth from row 6\n    # Output row 1: elements 0-1 from row 1, element 2 from row 3, elements 3-5 from row 1\n    # Output row 2: row 2 of the input\n    output = []\n    row0 = [grid[6][0]] + [grid[1][1], grid[1][2], grid[1][3], grid[1][4]] + [grid[6][5]]\n    output.append(row0)\n    row1 = [grid[1][0], grid[1][1], grid[3][2], grid[1][3], grid[1][4], grid[1][5]]\n    output.append(row1)\n    row2 = grid[2]\n    output.append(row2)\n    return output\n\nBut this is based on Example 1. Let's check if it works for Example 2.\n\nFor Example 2, the first output row is 5 5 4 5 5 5. According to this code, row0 would be:\n\ngrid[6][0] is 2, then elements 1-4 from row 1 (row 1 is 0 5 0 5 0 5), so elements 1-4 are 5, 0, 5, 0. Then sixth element is grid[6][5] is 0. So row0 would be [2, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], which doesn't match the actual output of 5 5 4 5 5 5. So this code is not correct.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nGiven that, I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother observation: the output for each example is 3 rows, and the input is 12 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input, then applying some transformation. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the third output row is the same as the input's row 2. For Example 3, the third output row is 5 8 5 4 8 4. Let's look at the input rows for Example 3. The input for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 5 0 0 5\nRow 2: 5 0 5 0 5 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 4 0 4\nRow 4: 0 0 0 4 0 0\nRow 5: 4 0 0 4 0 4\nRow 6: 0 0 2 0 0 2\nRow 7: 2 2 0 2 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 0 0 0 2\nRow 9: 8 8 0 8 8 8\nRow 10: 8 8 8 8 8 0\nRow 11: 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\nThe third output row is 5 8 5 4 8 4. This could be formed by combining elements from row 9 and row 10. For example, first element from row 9 (8), but the output starts with 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the third output row is formed by taking certain elements from the input's rows 9 and 10. For example, row 9 is 8 8 0 8 8 8. Row 10 is 8 8 8 8 8 0. Combining these, maybe the third output row is formed by taking the first element from row 9 (8), but the output starts with 5. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm unable to find a clear pattern. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make a guess based on the first example and try to code it, even if it's not correct for all examples.\n\nBut since the examples are different, perhaps the transformation is to take certain rows and apply a transformation to them.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input, then the next three, then the next three. But this would give 3 rows, each with 6 elements. But the output is 3 rows, so each output row is formed by combining the first three rows in some way.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 1: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nThe first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. This doesn't match. So this is not the case.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess that the output is formed by taking certain rows and applying some transformation. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from row 6, and the middle elements from row 1. The second output row is formed by taking the first two elements from row 1, the third from row 3, and the rest from row 1. The third output row is row 2 of the input.\n\nEven if this is not correct for all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Output is 3 rows of 6 elements\n    # Row 0: first element from row 6, then elements 1-4 from row 1, then sixth element from row 6\n    # Row 1: elements 0-1 from row 1, element 2 from row 3, elements 3-5 from row 1\n    # Row 2: row 2 of the input\n    row0 = [grid[6][0]] + [grid[1][1], grid[1][2], grid[1][3], grid[1][4]] + [grid[6][5]]\n    row1 = [grid[1][0], grid[1][1], grid[3][2], grid[1][3], grid[1][4], grid[1][5]]\n    row2 = grid[2]\n    return [row0, row1, row2]\n\nBut this is based on Example 1. Let's test it on Example 2.\n\nFor Example 2, row0 would be grid[6][0] = 2, then grid[1][1] is 5, grid[1][2] is 0, grid[1][3] is 5, grid[1][4] is 0, and grid[6][5] is 0. So row0 is [2,5,0,5,0,0], but the actual output is 5 5 4 5 5 5. So this is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nGiven that, I need to think of another approach. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. This could be formed by taking the first column of row 6 (2), then the second column of row 1 (5), third column of row 1 (0), fourth column of row 1 (5), fifth column of row 1 (5), sixth column of row 6 (2). But this gives 2,5,0,5,5,2, which is not the same as the output. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of certain rows and combining them with other elements. For example, in Example 1, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from row 6, and the middle elements from row 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code, even if it's not correct for all examples, as it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that maps the input grids to the output grids in these examples. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 1. The input is a 12x6 grid, and the output is a 3x6 grid. Wait, the output is 3 rows, each with 6 elements. So the transformation reduces the number of rows from 12 to 3. But how?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1:\n\nInput rows 0-11 (since it's 12 rows), output is 3 rows. Maybe the output is derived from combining certain rows of the input. For example, maybe the first three rows of the input are combined into the first output row? But the output has 3 rows, each with 6 elements. Let me check the first output row of Example 1: 2 5 5 5 5 2. The input's first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 1: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nBut the output first row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the output is derived from some kind of transformation on the input rows. Alternatively, maybe the output is a combination of certain columns or patterns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1: each output row is 6 elements. The input has 12 rows, so maybe each output row is derived from 4 input rows? But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a compressed version of the input. For example, each output row is formed by taking certain elements from the input. Let's think about the first output row of Example 1. The output is 2 5 5 5 5 2. Looking at the input rows, perhaps the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements of some rows. For example, maybe the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements of the first three input rows? Wait, the first input row is 0 5 5 5 5 0. The first and last elements are 0 and 0. But the output first row starts with 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that's not directly based on the input rows. Let me look for other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output. The input is 12 rows again, output is 3 rows. The output rows are 5 5 4 5 5 5, 0 5 8 5 8 5, 2 4 2 5 5 4.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 2:\n\nFirst input rows:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow 1: 0 5 0 5 0 5\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 5 0\nRow 3: 0 4 4 0 4 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 4\nRow 5: 0 4 0 4 0 4\nRow 6: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 9: 8 0 8 8 8 8\nRow 10: 0 0 8 8 8 8\nRow 11: 0 0 0 8 0 0\n\nThe output is 3 rows. Let's see the first output row: 5 5 4 5 5 5. The first input row is 5 5 0 5 5 5. The output first row's first two elements are 5 and 5, which match the first two elements of the first input row. The third element is 4. Looking at the input row 3 (row 3 is 0 4 4 0 4 0), the third element is 4. Maybe the third element is taken from row 3? Then the fourth element is 5. The fourth element of the first input row is 5. The fifth element is 5, which is the same as the first input row. The sixth element is 5. So maybe the first output row is combining elements from the first input row and some other rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is derived from combining certain rows. For example, the first output row could be formed by taking the first row of the input, then some other rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for each example. The output is 3 rows of 6 elements each. The input for each example is 12 rows of 6 elements each. So perhaps the output is derived by taking some combination of the input rows. For example, each output row is made from 4 input rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output rows might be formed by taking certain columns from the input. But the input has 6 columns, and the output has 6 columns. So that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input's rows in a way that each output row is derived from 4 input rows. For example, the first output row could be the first, second, third, and fourth input rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1. The first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. Looking at the input rows, perhaps the 2s are from the 8th row (row 8 in input) of the input. Let me check the input for Example 1:\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 1: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 4 0 0 0\nRow 4: 4 0 4 4 4 0\nRow 5: 4 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 2 0 2 2 0 2\nRow 7: 2 0 0 0 0 2\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 9: 0 8 0 8 0 0\nRow 10: 0 8 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 8 0 8 0 0\n\nThe output first row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. The first element is 2, which is from row 6, column 0. The second element is 5, which is from row 1, column 0. The third element is 5, from row 1, column 1. The fourth element is 5, from row 1, column 3. The fifth is 5, from row 1, column 4. The sixth is 2, from row 6, column 5. So maybe the output is combining elements from different rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by taking certain positions. For example, the output rows are formed by taking certain columns from the input. But the output has 6 columns, same as the input. So perhaps each output row is a combination of certain rows of the input.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 1. The first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. The second output row is 5 5 4 5 5 5. The third is 5 5 0 5 0 0. Let's look at the input rows. The first output row's first element is 2. Looking at row 6 (input row 6) which is 2 0 2 2 0 2. The first element is 2. The second element of the output row is 5. Looking at row 1, first element is 5. Third element is 5, from row 1, column 1. Fourth element is 5, from row 1, column 3. Fifth is 5, from row 1, column 4. Sixth is 2, from row 6, column 5. So maybe the first output row is taking elements from row 1 and row 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are derived from the input's rows in a way that each output row is formed by combining certain parts of the input. For example, the first output row could be formed by taking the first and last elements of certain rows. But this is not clear.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the third output row is 5 5 0 5 0 0. Looking at the input's rows. The third output row could be from row 2 (input row 2) which is 5 5 0 5 0 0. So that's the same as the input row 2. But that's only possible if the output is taking some of the input rows directly. But in that case, the output would have 12 rows, but it's 3 rows. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input. For example, in Example 1, the output is 3 rows, which could be the 6th, 7th, and 8th rows of the input. Let me check:\n\nInput row 6: 2 0 2 2 0 2\nRow 7: 2 0 0 0 0 2\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut the output rows are different. The first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the outputs. For example, in Example 1, the first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. The second output row is 5 5 4 5 5 5. The third is 5 5 0 5 0 0. Looking at these rows, the first two elements are 2 and 5, then 5 and 5, then 5 and 5. Then the third element varies. Maybe the first two elements are derived from certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the third output row is the same as the input row 2. So maybe the output is derived by taking certain rows from the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by taking every fourth row. For example, input has 12 rows. 12 divided by 4 is 3. So output rows could be rows 0, 4, 8. Let's check:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 4: 4 0 4 4 4 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut the output rows are not matching. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the output is derived from the input by taking certain columns. For example, the output's columns are derived from the input's columns. But the output has 6 columns, same as input. So maybe each output row is formed by combining certain columns from the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the output. For example, in the first output row of Example 1, the first and last elements are 2. In the input, row 6 has 2 in the first and last columns. Maybe the output is taking the first and last elements of certain rows and combining them. For example, the first output row is formed by combining the first and last elements of row 6, and some other elements.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1's first row: 2 5 5 5 5 2. The second element is 5, which is from row 1, column 0. The third element is 5, from row 1, column 1. Fourth is 5, from row 1, column 3. Fifth is 5, from row 1, column 4. Sixth is 2, from row 6, column 5. So maybe the first output row is combining elements from row 1 and row 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of row 6, the first column of row 1, then some other columns, then the last column of row 6. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns across multiple examples. For example, in Example 1, the third output row is the same as the input row 2. In Example 2, the third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. Looking at the input for Example 2's row 6: 2 2 2 0 0 0. So that's not matching. But in Example 2's output, the third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. Maybe this is derived from combining elements from row 6 and row 7. Row 6 is 2 2 2 0 0 0, row 7 is 0 2 2 0 2 0. So combining elements from these rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking certain elements from the input's rows. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from certain rows and the middle elements from others.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as being derived from the input by some transformation that involves taking the first and last elements of certain rows and combining them. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs for all examples. The output is always 3 rows. Let me check the outputs for all examples:\n\nExample 1: 3 rows.\nExample 2: 3 rows.\nExample 3: 3 rows.\nExample 4: 3 rows.\nExample 5: 3 rows.\nExample 6: 3 rows.\nTest input: 3 rows.\n\nSo the transformation is from 12 rows to 3 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input. For example, each output row is formed by combining 4 input rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking the first 3 rows of the input, then the next 3 rows, then the next 3 rows. But that would give 3 rows of 6 elements each, but the output is 3 rows. Wait, but the input is 12 rows. So maybe each output row is formed by combining 4 input rows. For example, the first output row is formed by combining the first four input rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input, then the next three rows, then the next three rows. But that would be 3 rows of 6 elements each. But that's not possible. Because each input row is 6 elements, and the output is 3 rows of 6 elements each. So maybe the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input, but that would be 3 rows of 6 elements each. But the output for example 1 is 3 rows, but the input has 12 rows. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth columns of the input's rows. But that's not helpful.\n\nAnother observation: the output for each example has 3 rows. The input has 12 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the first row of the input, then the third row, then the fifth row. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1's third row: 5 5 0 5 0 0. This is the same as the input row 2. So maybe the third output row is the input row 2. Similarly, for Example 2's third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. Looking at the input for Example 2, row 6 is 2 2 2 0 0 0. Row 7 is 0 2 2 0 2 0. Row 8 is 2 2 2 0 2 0. Maybe the third output row is formed by combining row 6, 7, and 8 in some way. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input's rows. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from row 6, and the middle elements from other rows.\n\nAlternatively, think about the outputs as being derived from the input by some kind of pattern that involves taking certain elements from the input's rows. For example, in Example 1's first output row, the first and last elements are 2, which are from row 6. The middle elements are 5, which are from row 1. So maybe the first output row is combining row 6 and row 1 in some way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being a compressed version of the input. For example, each output row is a combination of certain input rows. For example, the first output row is the first row of the input, then the second row, then the third row, but with some transformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by taking certain columns. For example, the output's first row is the first column of the input's rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. But that's not helpful.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Let's try to look for a pattern that can be applied across all examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs for all examples, they have 3 rows. The input is 12 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking every fourth row of the input. For example, rows 0, 4, 8. Let's check Example 1:\n\nInput rows 0, 4, 8:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 4: 4 0 4 4 4 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut the output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 5 5 5 5 2\nRow 1: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nSo this doesn't match. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the first row of the input, then the third row, then the fifth row. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by taking certain positions. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of the input's rows 6, 1, 7, 2, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, each output row has 6 elements. The input has 6 columns. So maybe each output row is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking columns 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 0 of certain rows. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by taking the first row of the input, then the second row, then the third row. But that would be 3 rows, but the input has 12 rows. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother observation: looking at the outputs for all examples, the first output row seems to have a pattern of 2s and 5s. For example, in Example 1, the first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. In Example 2, the first output row is 5 5 4 5 5 5. In Example 3, the first output row is 5 8 5 4 8 4. In Example 4, the first output row is 5 5 5 5 4 4. In Example 5, it's 5 4 8 4 4 4. In Example 6, it's 4 5 2 5 5 4. So there's no clear pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, each output row has a certain pattern. For example, the first output row of Example 1 has 2 at the start and end. The first output row of Example 6 has 4 at the start and end. Maybe the first and last elements of the output rows are derived from certain positions in the input.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1's first row: 2 5 5 5 5 2. The 2s are from row 6 of the input. Row 6 is 2 0 2 2 0 2. So first and last elements are 2. So maybe the first and last elements of the output rows are taken from the input's row 6, 7, or 8.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2's first output row, the first two elements are 5 and 5. Looking at the input row 0: 5 5 0 5 5 5. So first two elements are 5 and 5. So maybe the first output row is derived from the first input row.\n\nBut how does that fit with other examples?\n\nIn Example 3's first output row: 5 8 5 4 8 4. The first element is 5, which is from input row 0 (5 0 5 0 0 0). The second element is 8, which is from input row 9 (8 8 0 8 8 8). So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of certain operations, like taking certain rows or columns, or applying some kind of pattern.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs for all examples, the output rows are derived from the input by taking certain positions. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements of certain rows and combining them with other elements.\n\nAlternatively, think about the outputs as being derived from the input by some kind of averaging or pattern matching. But without more examples, this is hard.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the pattern in the outputs. For example, in Example 1, the first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. The second output row is 5 5 4 5 5 5. The third is 5 5 0 5 0 0. Looking at these, the first two elements are 2 and 5, then 5 and 5, then 5 and 5. The third element varies. Maybe the first two elements are derived from certain rows, and the rest are derived from others.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs for all examples, each output row has 6 elements. The input has 6 columns. Maybe each output row is formed by taking certain columns from the input's rows. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and third columns of certain rows. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the input by taking the first and last elements of certain rows, and the middle elements from others. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements of row 6, and the middle elements from row 1.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to take from?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs for all examples, and trying to find a common pattern. For example, in all examples, the output has 3 rows. The input has 12 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking every fourth row of the input. Let's check:\n\nFor Example 1, rows 0, 4, 8:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 4: 4 0 4 4 4 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut the output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 5 5 5 5 2\nRow 1: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nThese don't match. So this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the rows 6, 7, 8. Let's see:\n\nRow 6: 2 0 2 2 0 2\nRow 7: 2 0 0 0 0 2\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut the output for Example 1 is different. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the first output row is derived from the first three rows of the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first element of each of the first three rows, then the second, etc. But that would give 3 elements per row, but the output has 6 elements. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output row is formed by combining elements from different rows. For example, the first output row is formed by combining elements from row 1, row 6, and row 7. But this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern that is common across all examples. For example, in all examples, the output has three rows, and each row has six elements. The input has 12 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by the first row of the input, the second output row is formed by the second row, and the third output row is formed by the third row. But that would mean the output is the first three rows of the input, but that's not the case for the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first row of the input, then the third row, then the fifth row. Let's check Example 1:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\nRow 4: 4 0 4 4 4 0\n\nBut the output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 5 5 5 5 2\nRow 1: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nSo the third output row matches row 2 of the input. The first output row is not matching row 0. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the third output row is the same as the input row 2. In Example 2, the third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. Looking at the input for Example 2, row 6 is 2 2 2 0 0 0, row 7 is 0 2 2 0 2 0, row 8 is 2 2 2 0 2 0. Maybe the third output row is formed by combining elements from these rows. For example, the first two elements are 2 and 4. Looking at row 6, first element is 2. Row 7, second element is 2. Row 8, first element is 2. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output row is formed by taking the first, third, and fifth elements from certain rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let me look at the outputs for all examples and see if there's a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: 2 5 5 5 5 2\nRow 1: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nRow 2 is the same as input row 2. So maybe the third output row is the third input row. Similarly, in Example 2's output, the third row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. Let's see the input for Example 2:\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\n\nMaybe the third output row is formed by combining these three rows. For example, the first element is 2 (from row 6), the second is 4 (maybe from row 7 or 8?), but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output row is derived from the input's rows 6, 7, 8. Let's try to combine them:\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\n\nCombining these, maybe the third output row is formed by taking the first element from row 6, the second from row 7, the third from row 8, and so on. But that would give:\n\nRow 6: 2, row 7: 2, row 8: 2 \u2192 2 2 2 ... but the output is 2 4 2 5 5 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output row is formed by taking certain elements from these rows. For example, the first element is 2 (from row 6), the second is 2 (from row 7), the third is 2 (from row 8), but that doesn't match the output.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should think of the transformation as taking certain positions from the input's rows. For example, the output rows are formed by taking the first and last elements of certain rows and combining them with other elements.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, each output row has a certain pattern. For example, the first output row of Example 1 starts with 2 and ends with 2. This suggests that the first and last elements are taken from the input's row 6. Row 6 in Example 1 is 2 0 2 2 0 2. So the first and last elements are 2. So maybe the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from row 6 and the middle elements from row 1.\n\nRow 1 in Example 1 is 5 5 0 5 5 5. So the middle elements are 5, 5, 5, 5. So combining the first and last elements from row 6 (2, 2) and the middle elements from row 1 (5, 5, 5, 5), but how? The output row has 6 elements: 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2. So the first element is 2 (from row 6), second is 5 (from row 1), third is 5 (from row 1), fourth is 5 (from row 1), fifth is 5 (from row 1), sixth is 2 (from row 6). So this seems to be the case.\n\nSo for the first output row of Example 1, it's taking the first element from row 6, then the second, third, fourth, fifth elements from row 1, and the sixth element from row 6.\n\nSo the first output row is formed by taking the first and sixth elements from row 6, and the second to fifth elements from row 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the second output row of Example 1: 5 5 4 5 5 5. Let's see. This could be formed by taking the first two elements from row 1 (5,5), the third element from row 3 (4), and the fourth to sixth elements from row 1 (5,5,5). So row 3 is 0 0 4 0 0 0. So third element is 4. So the second output row is formed by taking first two elements from row 1, third from row 3, and the rest from row 1.\n\nFor the third output row, it's the same as row 2 of the input.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is taking certain rows from the input and combining them in specific ways.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\n- The first output row is formed by taking the first and sixth elements from row 6, and the second to fifth elements from row 1.\n- The second output row is formed by taking the first two elements from row 1, the third element from row 3, and the fourth to sixth elements from row 1.\n- The third output row is the same as row 2 of the input.\n\nBut this is specific to Example 1. How to generalize this to other examples?\n\nLet me check Example 2. The output for Example 2 is:\n\n5 5 4 5 5 5\n0 5 8 5 8 5\n2 4 2 5 5 4\n\nLet's see the input for Example 2:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow 1: 0 5 0 5 0 5\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 5 0\nRow 3: 0 4 4 0 4 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 4\nRow 5: 0 4 0 4 0 4\nRow 6: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 9: 8 0 8 8 8 8\nRow 10: 0 0 8 8 8 8\nRow 11: 0 0 0 8 0 0\n\nThe first output row is 5 5 4 5 5 5. This could be formed by taking the first two elements from row 0 (5,5), the third element from row 3 (4), and the fourth to sixth elements from row 0 (5,5,5). So that's 5,5,4,5,5,5.\n\nThe second output row is 0 5 8 5 8 5. This could be formed by taking the first element from row 1 (0), the second from row 1 (5), the third from row 9 (8), and the fourth to sixth from row 1 (5,8,5)? Wait, row 1 is 0 5 0 5 0 5. So fourth element is 5, fifth is 0, sixth is 5. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the third element is from row 9. Row 9 is 8 0 8 8 8 8. So third element is 8. So the second output row is formed by taking first element from row 1 (0), second from row 1 (5), third from row 9 (8), fourth from row 1 (5), fifth from row 9 (8), sixth from row 1 (5). That gives 0 5 8 5 8 5, which matches.\n\nThe third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. This could be formed by taking the first element from row 6 (2), the second from row 7 (2), third from row 8 (2), but that would give 2 2 2 ... which doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's formed by taking elements from rows 6, 7, 8. For example, first element from row 6 (2), second from row 7 (2), third from row 8 (2), but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the third output row is formed by taking elements from row 6, row 7, and row 8. For example, the first element is 2 (row 6), second is 4 (from row 7?), but row 7 is 0 2 2 0 2 0. So no. Alternatively, maybe the third output row is formed by taking certain elements from rows 6, 7, 8. For example:\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\n\nCombining these, maybe the third output row is formed by taking the first element from row 6 (2), the second from row 7 (2), the third from row 8 (2), and then the fourth from row 6 (0), fifth from row 7 (2), sixth from row 8 (0). But that gives 2 2 2 0 2 0, which doesn't match. So this is not the case.\n\nBut the third output row for Example 2 is 2 4 2 5 5 4. Let's see if this can be derived from rows 6, 7, 8. For example, first element 2 (row 6), second element 4 (maybe from row 9?), but row 9 is 8 0 8 8 8 8. So that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the third output row is formed by taking elements from row 6, row 7, and row 9. For example, first element from row 6 (2), second from row 7 (2), third from row 9 (8), but that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output row is formed by taking the first element from row 6 (2), the second from row 7 (2), the third from row 8 (2), and the fourth from row 6 (0), fifth from row 7 (2), sixth from row 8 (0). But that gives 2 2 2 0 2 0, which is not matching. \n\nThis is not working. So maybe the pattern is not consistent across all examples, but I need to find a general rule.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the third output row is the same as the input row 2. In Example 2, the third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. Looking at the input rows 6, 7, 8:\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\n\nIf we take the first element from row 6 (2), the second from row 7 (2), the third from row 8 (2), then the fourth from row 6 (0), fifth from row 7 (2), sixth from row 8 (0), we get 2 2 2 0 2 0. But the output is 2 4 2 5 5 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third output row is formed by taking elements from row 6, row 9, and row 10. Row 9 is 8 0 8 8 8 8. Row 10 is 0 0 8 8 8 8. So taking first element from row 6 (2), second from row 9 (8), third from row 10 (8), but that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should think of the transformation as taking certain rows from the input and modifying them in a specific way.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows are derived from the input by taking the first three rows, then the next three rows, then the next three rows. But the output has three rows, so each output row is derived from a group of three input rows. For example, the first output row is derived from the first three input rows, the second from the next three, and the third from the next three.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first three input rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 1: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nThe first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. This doesn't match the first three rows. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the output rows are derived from the input by taking certain elements from the input rows. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from row 6, and the middle elements from row 1. The second output row is formed by taking the first two elements from row 1, the third from row 3, and the rest from row 1. The third output row is row 2 of the input.\n\nIf this pattern is followed, then for other examples, the same logic applies. For example, in Example 2, the first output row is formed by taking the first two elements from row 0 (5,5), the third from row 3 (4), and the rest from row 0. This gives 5 5 4 5 5 5, which matches the first output row.\n\nThe second output row is formed by taking the first element from row 1 (0), the second from row 1 (5), the third from row 9 (8), and the fourth from row 1 (5), fifth from row 9 (8), sixth from row 1 (5). This gives 0 5 8 5 8 5, which matches.\n\nThe third output row is row 2 of the input. But in Example 2, the third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4. But row 2 of the input is 0 0 0 5 5 0. So this doesn't match. So this pattern is not consistent.\n\nBut in Example 1, the third output row is row 2 of the input. In Example 2, it's not. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe the transformation is to take the first three rows of the input and modify them in some way. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input and applying a certain transformation. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first row of the input, then the second row, then the third row. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, each output row has 6 elements. The input has 6 columns. So perhaps each output row is formed by taking certain columns from the input's rows. For example, the first output row is formed by taking columns 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2 from certain rows.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I need to make an educated guess. Based on the first example, the transformation seems to involve taking certain rows and combining their elements in specific ways. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from row 6, and the middle elements from row 1. The second output row is formed by taking first two elements from row 1, third from row 3, and the rest from row 1. The third output row is row 2 of the input.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation could be:\n\n- Output row 0: take first element from row 6, then elements 1-4 from row 1, then sixth element from row 6.\n- Output row 1: take elements 0-1 from row 1, element 2 from row 3, elements 3-5 from row 1.\n- Output row 2: take row 2 of the input.\n\nBut this is specific to Example 1. How to generalize this?\n\nIn Example 2, the first output row is formed by taking elements 0-1 from row 0, element 2 from row 3, and elements 3-5 from row 0. The second output row is formed by taking elements 0 from row 1, element 1 from row 1, element 2 from row 9, elements 3-5 from row 1. The third output row is not row 2, but something else.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation varies between examples. So this approach is not general.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input, then applying a transformation to them. For example, the first output row is the first row of the input, the second is the second, and the third is the third. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the first row of the input, then the third row, then the fifth row. But this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. However, looking at the outputs, it seems that the third output row is often the same as the input's row 2. For example, in Example 1, it's row 2. In Example 2, it's not, but in Example 3, let's check.\n\nExample 3's input is 12 rows. Output is 3 rows. The third output row is 5 8 5 4 8 4. Let's check the input for Example 3:\n\nRow 2: 5 0 5 0 5 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 4 0 4\nRow 4: 0 0 0 4 0 0\nRow 5: 4 0 0 4 0 4\nRow 6: 0 0 2 0 0 2\nRow 7: 2 2 0 2 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 0 0 0 2\nRow 9: 8 8 0 8 8 8\nRow 10: 8 8 8 8 8 0\nRow 11: 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\nThe third output row is 5 8 5 4 8 4. This could be formed by taking elements from row 9 and row 10. For example, row 9 is 8 8 0 8 8 8. Row 10 is 8 8 8 8 8 0. So combining these, maybe the third output row is formed by taking elements from row 9 and row 10.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see. The most consistent part is that the third output row is often the same as the input's row 2. So perhaps the third output row is always the input's row 2. But this is not true for Example 2, where the third output row is 2 4 2 5 5 4, and row 2 of the input is 0 0 0 5 5 0.\n\nSo this is not the case.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has 3 rows, and the input has 12 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking every fourth row of the input. For example, rows 0, 4, 8. But this doesn't match the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking rows 6, 7, 8. Let's check for Example 1: rows 6, 7, 8 are:\n\nRow 6: 2 0 2 2 0 2\nRow 7: 2 0 0 0 0 2\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nThe output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 5 5 5 5 2\nRow 1: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nThese don't match. So this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that involves taking certain rows and combining their elements. Based on the first example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from row 6 and the middle elements from row 1. The second output row is formed by taking the first two elements from row 1, the third from row 3, and the rest from row 1. The third output row is row 2 of the input.\n\nSo for the general case, the transformation might be:\n\n- Output row 0: take first element from row 6, then elements 1-4 from row 1, then sixth element from row 6.\n- Output row 1: take elements 0-1 from row 1, element 2 from row 3, elements 3-5 from row 1.\n- Output row 2: take row 2 of the input.\n\nBut this is specific to Example 1. For other examples, this might not hold, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would need to:\n\n- For the first output row, take elements from row 6 and row 1.\n- For the second output row, take elements from row 1 and row 3.\n- For the third output row, take row 2 of the input.\n\nBut this is just for Example 1. How to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking row 6, the second output row is formed by taking row 1 and row 3, and the third output row is row 2.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and write the code based on this.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Assume grid is a list of 12 rows, each with 6 elements\n    # Output is 3 rows of 6 elements each\n    # Output row 0: first element from row 6, elements 1-4 from row 1, sixth from row 6\n    # Output row 1: elements 0-1 from row 1, element 2 from row 3, elements 3-5 from row 1\n    # Output row 2: row 2 of the input\n    output = []\n    row0 = [grid[6][0]] + [grid[1][1], grid[1][2], grid[1][3], grid[1][4]] + [grid[6][5]]\n    output.append(row0)\n    row1 = [grid[1][0], grid[1][1], grid[3][2], grid[1][3], grid[1][4], grid[1][5]]\n    output.append(row1)\n    row2 = grid[2]\n    output.append(row2)\n    return output\n\nBut this is based on Example 1. Let's check if it works for Example 2.\n\nFor Example 2, the first output row is 5 5 4 5 5 5. According to this code, row0 would be:\n\ngrid[6][0] is 2, then elements 1-4 from row 1 (row 1 is 0 5 0 5 0 5), so elements 1-4 are 5, 0, 5, 0. Then sixth element is grid[6][5] is 0. So row0 would be [2, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], which doesn't match the actual output of 5 5 4 5 5 5. So this code is not correct.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nGiven that, I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother observation: the output for each example is 3 rows, and the input is 12 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input, then applying some transformation. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the third output row is the same as the input's row 2. For Example 3, the third output row is 5 8 5 4 8 4. Let's look at the input rows for Example 3. The input for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 5 0 0 5\nRow 2: 5 0 5 0 5 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 4 0 4\nRow 4: 0 0 0 4 0 0\nRow 5: 4 0 0 4 0 4\nRow 6: 0 0 2 0 0 2\nRow 7: 2 2 0 2 2 0\nRow 8: 2 2 0 0 0 2\nRow 9: 8 8 0 8 8 8\nRow 10: 8 8 8 8 8 0\nRow 11: 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\nThe third output row is 5 8 5 4 8 4. This could be formed by combining elements from row 9 and row 10. For example, first element from row 9 (8), but the output starts with 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the third output row is formed by taking certain elements from the input's rows 9 and 10. For example, row 9 is 8 8 0 8 8 8. Row 10 is 8 8 8 8 8 0. Combining these, maybe the third output row is formed by taking the first element from row 9 (8), but the output starts with 5. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm unable to find a clear pattern. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make a guess based on the first example and try to code it, even if it's not correct for all examples.\n\nBut since the examples are different, perhaps the transformation is to take certain rows and apply a transformation to them.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the first three rows of the input, then the next three, then the next three. But this would give 3 rows, each with 6 elements. But the output is 3 rows, so each output row is formed by combining the first three rows in some way.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 1: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow 2: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nThe first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. This doesn't match. So this is not the case.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess that the output is formed by taking certain rows and applying some transformation. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from row 6, and the middle elements from row 1. The second output row is formed by taking the first two elements from row 1, the third from row 3, and the rest from row 1. The third output row is row 2 of the input.\n\nEven if this is not correct for all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Output is 3 rows of 6 elements\n    # Row 0: first element from row 6, then elements 1-4 from row 1, then sixth element from row 6\n    # Row 1: elements 0-1 from row 1, element 2 from row 3, elements 3-5 from row 1\n    # Row 2: row 2 of the input\n    row0 = [grid[6][0]] + [grid[1][1], grid[1][2], grid[1][3], grid[1][4]] + [grid[6][5]]\n    row1 = [grid[1][0], grid[1][1], grid[3][2], grid[1][3], grid[1][4], grid[1][5]]\n    row2 = grid[2]\n    return [row0, row1, row2]\n\nBut this is based on Example 1. Let's test it on Example 2.\n\nFor Example 2, row0 would be grid[6][0] = 2, then grid[1][1] is 5, grid[1][2] is 0, grid[1][3] is 5, grid[1][4] is 0, and grid[6][5] is 0. So row0 is [2,5,0,5,0,0], but the actual output is 5 5 4 5 5 5. So this is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nGiven that, I need to think of another approach. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first output row is 2 5 5 5 5 2. This could be formed by taking the first column of row 6 (2), then the second column of row 1 (5), third column of row 1 (0), fourth column of row 1 (5), fifth column of row 1 (5), sixth column of row 6 (2). But this gives 2,5,0,5,5,2, which is not the same as the output. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the first and last elements of certain rows and combining them with other elements. For example, in Example 1, the first output row is formed by taking the first and last elements from row 6, and the middle elements from row 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code, even if it's not correct for all examples, as it's the best I can do.\n"
