          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 7x9. The output seems to have some changes. Let me compare specific rows. For instance, the first row is the same in both input and output. The second row is all 6s in input and output. The third row in input is 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0. So that's the same. Wait, but the sixth row in input is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. The output for that row is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. Hmm, so the middle elements changed. Let's look at the positions. The original row is [4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4]. The output is [4, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 4]. So the second and third elements (indices 1 and 2) changed from 0 to 8, then the fourth to seventh elements (indices 3-6) changed from 6 to 7, and the eighth element (index 7) changed from 0 to 8. \n\nSo maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on some rule. Let me check other rows. For example, the seventh row in input is 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 0. The output is 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 0. So that's the same. Wait, but the sixth row in the output is different. Maybe there's a specific pattern for certain positions. \n\nLooking at Example 2. The input's sixth row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 6. The output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 6. So that's the same. But in Example 2, the second row of input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the middle elements changed. Let's see: original is [4,7,8,7,8,8,8,8,4]. Output is [4,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,4]. So the second element (7) becomes 6, third (8) becomes 0, fourth (7) becomes 6, fifth (8) becomes 0, sixth (8) becomes 0, seventh (8) becomes 0, eighth (8) becomes 0. So maybe there's some pattern here where certain positions are being replaced based on their position or some other rule.\n\nLooking at the third example. The input's first row is 6 0 6 4 6 0 0 4 6. The output is the same. The second row input is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. Output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So the fourth element (0) becomes 8, and the eighth element (0) becomes 8. The third row input is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. Output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So the fourth element (0) becomes 8, and the eighth (6) becomes 7. \n\nHmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their position. For example, in the third example, the fourth column (index 3) in some rows changes from 0 to 8, and the eighth column (index 7) changes from 6 to 7. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is related to some kind of pattern in the grid. For example, maybe certain cells are being replaced based on their neighbors. Or maybe there's a rule that replaces certain values based on their position. \n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns where the output is generated by modifying specific cells. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row changes from 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4 to 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. Let's look at the positions:\n\nOriginal: [4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4]\nOutput: [4, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 4]\n\nSo the second and third elements (indices 1 and 2) are 0 \u2192 8, then the fourth to seventh elements (indices 3-6) are 6 \u2192 7, and the eighth element (index 7) is 0 \u2192 8. \n\nSo maybe for certain positions, the value is being replaced based on some rule. For instance, if the original value is 0, it's replaced with 8, or if it's 6, it's replaced with 7. But how to determine which positions are being modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern based on the row and column indices. For example, in the sixth row of Example 1, the positions that are modified are columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7. Let me check if these positions have some relation to their positions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on some kind of pattern that's applied to certain regions of the grid. For example, maybe certain cells are being replaced based on their position relative to other cells. \n\nLooking at the third example's second row: input is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. Output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So the fourth element (index 3) is 0 \u2192 8, and the eighth element (index 7) is 0 \u2192 8. \n\nIn the third example's third row: input is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. Output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So the fourth element (index 3) is 0 \u2192 8, and the eighth element (index 7) is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nSo maybe in certain positions, the value is being replaced based on their column. For example, columns 3 and 7. Let's check for columns 3 and 7. \n\nIn the third example's third row, column 3 (index 3) is 0 \u2192 8. Column 7 (index 7) is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the fourth column (index 3) is 7 \u2192 6, but in the output it's 6. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a rule that replaces certain cells based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. \n\nLooking at the first example's sixth row, the output has 8s in columns 1, 2, 7, and 7s in columns 3-6. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the output has 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4. So the original row was 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the second element (7) becomes 6, third (8) becomes 0, fourth (7) becomes 6, fifth (8) becomes 0, sixth (8) becomes 0, seventh (8) becomes 0, eighth (8) becomes 0. \n\nThis seems like maybe the positions are being modified based on their distance from the center or some other pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid-based pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, cells in certain rows or columns are modified. \n\nAnother approach: looking for the difference between input and output. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row's output is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The original is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. So the first and last elements are the same. The middle elements (positions 1, 2, 3-6, 7) are modified. \n\nLooking at the positions that are modified in this row: columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7. So columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7. That's columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Wait, that's columns 1 to 7. But the original row is 9 columns. So maybe there's a pattern where certain columns are being modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, in row 5 (assuming rows are 0-based or 1-based?), but I need to check the examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is adjacent to certain values, it's replaced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row's output has 8s in positions 1, 2, 7, and 7s in positions 3-6. So maybe the original value is 0 \u2192 8, 6 \u2192 7. \n\nBut in the third example's third row, the fourth element (index 3) is 0 \u2192 8, and the eighth element (index 7) is 6 \u2192 7. So that seems consistent. \n\nBut in the second example's second row, the original value is 7 (position 1) \u2192 6, 8 (position 2) \u2192 0, 7 (position 3) \u2192 6, 8 (position 4) \u2192 0, etc. So that's different. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's look for patterns in the output. \n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, maybe certain cells are being replaced with 8s or 7s based on their position. For example, in the first example, the sixth row has 8s in columns 1, 2, and 7, and 7s in columns 3-6. \n\nIn the second example, the second row has 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4. So the original values were 7, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8. So the second element (7) becomes 6, third (8) becomes 0, fourth (7) becomes 6, fifth (8) becomes 0, sixth (8) becomes 0, seventh (8) becomes 0, eighth (8) becomes 0. \n\nThis seems like a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their position. For example, in the second row of example 2, the second and fourth elements are being replaced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a rule where if the original value is 0, it's replaced with 8, and if it's 6, it's replaced with 7. But that doesn't fit all examples. \n\nAnother thought: looking at the third example's second row, the output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. The original is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. So the fourth element (0) becomes 8, and the eighth (0) becomes 8. \n\nSo maybe in certain positions, the value is being replaced with 8 if it's 0, or 7 if it's 6. But in the first example's sixth row, the original has 0s and 6s, and the output has 8s and 7s. \n\nBut in the second example's second row, the original has 7 and 8, and the output has 6, 0, 6, 0, etc. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns are modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the parity of the row or column. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns are modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value. For example, if the value is 0, replace with 8, if it's 6, replace with 7. But in the second example's second row, the original value is 7, which is replaced with 6, and 8 is replaced with 0. So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe I should look for patterns in the positions that are modified. \n\nLooking at the first example's sixth row, the modified positions are columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7. That's columns 1 to 7. But the original row is 9 columns. So columns 1-7 are modified. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the modified positions are columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Wait, the original row is [4,7,8,7,8,8,8,8,4], and the output is [4,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,4]. So columns 1-7 are modified. \n\nIn the third example's second row, the modified columns are 3 and 7. \n\nThis is inconsistent. Maybe there's a different approach. \n\nAnother idea: looking for the positions that are modified in the output. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the output has 8s in columns 1, 2, and 7, and 7s in columns 3-6. \n\nIn the third example's third row, columns 3 and 7 are modified. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the value is replaced based on their column. For example, columns 3 and 7 are modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if the original value is 0, then replace with 8, if it's 6, replace with 7. But this doesn't fit the second example. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid pattern, like replacing certain cells based on their position. For example, in rows where the row index is even, certain columns are modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, in the first example, the sixth row's output is modified in columns 1-7, but that's not consistent with other examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if the cell is in column 3 or 7, replace with 8 or 7. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nAnother approach: let's look at the outputs for the examples and see if there's a pattern in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output for the sixth row is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The original is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. So the first and last elements are the same. The middle elements are modified. \n\nIn Example 2, the second row's output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. The original is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The first and last elements are the same. The middle elements are modified. \n\nIn Example 3, the second row's output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. The original is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. The first, second, third, and last elements are the same. The fourth and eighth elements are modified. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the transformation might involve replacing certain positions in the middle of the row. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8, and if it's 6, replace with 7. But in the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8, which are replaced with 6 and 0. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and its position. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8 if it's in a certain column, or 7 if in another. \n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, in rows where the row index is 5 (assuming 0-based), certain columns are modified. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1's sixth row: the modified values are 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8. This seems like a pattern where the middle part is replaced with 7s, and the ends are 8s. \n\nIn Example 2's second row: the modified values are 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the middle part is replaced with 0s and 6s. \n\nThis is getting too vague. \n\nMaybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. For example, in certain positions, the value is replaced with 8 or 7 based on their position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, for each cell (i,j), if j is in certain columns, replace with a certain value. \n\nFor example, in the first example's sixth row, columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7 are modified. \n\nBut how to determine which columns are modified. \n\nLooking at the first example's sixth row: columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7. That's columns 1-7. But in the third example's third row, columns 3 and 7 are modified. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nAnother idea: looking for the pattern in the outputs. For example, in the first example's output, the sixth row has 8s in columns 1, 2, and 7, and 7s in columns 3-6. This could be a pattern where the middle columns are replaced with 7s, and the first and last columns are 8s. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the output has 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0. The first and last are 4 and 4. The middle columns are modified. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and its position. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8 if it's in column 1 or 2, or 7 if it's in column 3-6, or 8 if it's in column 7. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row index. For example, in rows where the row index is 5 (assuming 0-based), certain columns are modified. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and its position. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8, and if it's 6, replace with 7. \n\nBut in the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8, which are replaced with 6 and 0. So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. \n\nLooking at the third example's third row: input is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. Output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So columns 3 (index 3) is 0 \u2192 8, and column 7 (index 7) is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nSo maybe for certain columns, the value is replaced based on their position. For example, column 3 is replaced with 8 if the original is 0, and column 7 is replaced with 7 if the original is 6. \n\nBut how to determine which columns. \n\nLooking at the first example's sixth row: columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7 are modified. So columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. \n\nIn the third example's third row, columns 3 and 7 are modified. \n\nThis is inconsistent. \n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, for each cell (i,j), if j is in certain ranges, replace with certain values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and its position. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8, if it's 6, replace with 7, and if it's 7, replace with 6, and 8 with 0. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nLooking at the second example's second row: original is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. Output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the second element (7) becomes 6, third (8) becomes 0, fourth (7) becomes 6, fifth (8) becomes 0, sixth (8) becomes 0, seventh (8) becomes 0, eighth (8) becomes 0. \n\nSo this seems like a pattern where for certain positions, the value is replaced based on its original value. For example, 7 becomes 6, 8 becomes 0. \n\nBut why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value's parity. For example, if the original value is even, replace with something. But 7 is odd, 8 is even. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and its position. For example, if the original value is 7, replace with 6, and if it's 8, replace with 0. \n\nBut how to determine which positions. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. \n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. \n\nFor example, in the first example's sixth row, the modified columns are 1, 2, 3-6, 7. That's columns 1-7. So maybe for rows where the row is 5 (assuming 0-based), columns 1-7 are modified. \n\nBut how to determine the rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value being 0 or 6, and replacing them with 8 or 7. \n\nIn the first example's sixth row, the original values are 0 and 6, and the output is 8 and 7. \n\nIn the third example's third row, the original values are 0 and 6, and the output is 8 and 7. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8, which are replaced with 6 and 0. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not based on the original value but on the position. \n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in column 1 or 2, replace with 8, if in column 3-6, replace with 7, and if in column 7, replace with 8. \n\nBut this would explain the first example's sixth row. \n\nIn the third example's third row, the fourth column (index 3) is replaced with 8, and the eighth column (index 7) is replaced with 7. \n\nThis doesn't fit the previous pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, in certain rows, certain columns are modified. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the sum of its row and column indices. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nMaybe I should try to find a pattern that works for the examples. \n\nLooking at the third example's third row: input is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. Output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So columns 3 (index 3) is 0 \u2192 8, and column 7 (index 7) is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nIn the first example's sixth row: columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7 are modified. \n\nIn the second example's second row: columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are modified. \n\nThis suggests that for certain rows, the entire middle part is modified. \n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the row index. For example, for rows where the row index is 5 (assuming 0-based), the entire row is modified in certain columns. \n\nBut without knowing the row indices, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if the cell is in column 3 or 7, replace with 8 or 7. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the column index. For example, if the column is 3, replace 0 with 8, and if it's 7, replace 6 with 7. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time constraints, maybe I should try to implement a transformation that replaces certain positions with certain values based on their column. For example, in columns 3 and 7, replace 0 with 8 and 6 with 7. \n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. \n\nLooking at the third example's third row: column 3 is 0 \u2192 8, column 7 is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nIn the first example's sixth row: columns 3-6 are 6 \u2192 7, and columns 1, 2, 7 are 0 \u2192 8. \n\nSo this suggests that for columns 3-6, replace 6 with 7, and for columns 1, 2, 7, replace 0 with 8. \n\nBut in the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8, which are replaced with 6 and 0. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the column index. For example, if the column is even, replace with 8, or something like that. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven that the problem requires a Python function, and the examples are not fully clear, I'll have to make an educated guess. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is based on the following rules:\n\n- For each cell (i,j), if j is in columns 1, 2, or 7, replace 0 with 8.\n- If j is in columns 3-6, replace 6 with 7.\n- For other columns, leave as is.\n\nBut this would explain the first example's sixth row. \n\nIn the third example's third row, column 3 is 0 \u2192 8, column 7 is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8, which are not 0 or 6, so they would remain. But in the output, they are replaced. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value being 0 or 6, and replacing them with 8 or 7, but for certain columns. \n\nBut how to determine which columns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, in rows where the row index is 5 (assuming 0-based), replace certain columns. \n\nBut without more examples, this is hard. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation replaces certain cells based on their column. For example, columns 3 and 7 are modified. \n\nBut this is not enough. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8 if it's in column 1, 2, or 7, and replace with 7 if it's in column 3-6. \n\nBut this would explain the first example's sixth row. \n\nIn the third example's third row, column 3 is 0 \u2192 8, column 7 is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8, which are not 0 or 6, so they would remain. But in the output, they are replaced. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut maybe the second example's second row is an exception. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the column. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8, if it's 6, replace with 7, if it's 7, replace with 6, and if it's 8, replace with 0. \n\nBut this would explain the second example's second row. \n\nLet's test this hypothesis. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the original is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. \n\nAccording to this rule, 7 becomes 6, 8 becomes 0. So the output would be 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4, which matches the example. \n\nIn the first example's sixth row, the original is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. \n\nReplacing 0 with 8, 6 with 7: 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4, which matches the example. \n\nIn the third example's third row, the original is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. \n\nReplacing 0 with 8, 6 with 7: 0 7 7 8 0 0 0 7 0. But the actual output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the rule is not consistent. \n\nBut in the third example's third row, the output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. The original is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. So the first two elements are 0 and 6, but in the output they are unchanged. So the rule must be different. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not based on the original value but on the position. \n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the column index. For example, for columns 3 and 7, replace 0 with 8 and 6 with 7. \n\nIn the third example's third row, column 3 is 0 \u2192 8, column 7 is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nIn the first example's sixth row, columns 3-6 are 6 \u2192 7, and columns 1, 2, 7 are 0 \u2192 8. \n\nIn the second example's second row, columns 3-6 are 7 and 8, which are replaced with 6 and 0. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is based on the column index and the original value. \n\nBut how to determine the exact rules. \n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the following rules:\n\n- For columns 1 and 2: if the original value is 0, replace with 8.\n- For columns 3-6: if the original value is 6, replace with 7.\n- For column 7: if the original value is 0, replace with 8; if it's 6, replace with 7.\n- For other columns: leave as is.\n\nThis would explain the first and third examples. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8 in columns 1 and 2, which are not 0, so they remain. But in the output, they are replaced with 6 and 0. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut perhaps the second example's second row is an exception, or there's another rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row index. For example, in row 5 (assuming 0-based), columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7 are modified. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation replaces certain cells based on their column. For columns 1, 2, 7, replace 0 with 8. For columns 3-6, replace 6 with 7. \n\nThis would explain the first and third examples. \n\nFor the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8 in columns 1 and 2, which are not 0, so they would remain. But the output shows them as 6 and 0. This suggests that this hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nBut perhaps the second example's second row is an exception, or there's another rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the column. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8 for columns 1, 2, 7; if it's 6, replace with 7 for columns 3-6. \n\nBut for other values, like 7 or 8, replace with 6 or 0. \n\nThis would explain the second example's second row. \n\nBut how to determine which values to replace. \n\nThis seems like a possible pattern. \n\nSo the transformation would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n- If j is in columns 1, 2, or 7:\n   - if the original value is 0, replace with 8\n   - else, replace with 6 if it's 7, or 0 if it's 8\n- If j is in columns 3-6:\n   - if the original value is 6, replace with 7\n   - else, replace with 6 if it's 7, or 0 if it's 8\n- Else, leave as is.\n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nThis would explain the second example's second row: columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7. \n\nOriginal values: 7, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8. \n\nFor j=1: 7 \u2192 6\nj=2: 8 \u2192 0\nj=3: 7 \u2192 6\nj=4: 8 \u2192 0\nj=5: 8 \u2192 0\nj=6: 8 \u2192 0\nj=7: 8 \u2192 0\n\nWhich matches the output: 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4.\n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nFor the first example's sixth row: columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7.\n\nOriginal values: 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0.\n\nj=1: 0 \u2192 8\nj=2: 0 \u2192 8\nj=3-6: 6 \u2192 7\nj=7: 0 \u2192 8\n\nWhich matches the output: 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4.\n\nFor the third example's third row: columns 3 and 7.\n\nOriginal values: 0 (j=3) \u2192 8, 6 (j=7) \u2192 7. \n\nWhich matches the output: 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0.\n\nThis seems to work. \n\nSo the transformation rules are:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n- If j is 1, 2, or 7:\n   - if the original value is 0 \u2192 8\n   - else if the original value is 7 \u2192 6\n   - else if the original value is 8 \u2192 0\n   - else leave as is\n- If j is 3-6:\n   - if the original value is 6 \u2192 7\n   - else if the original value is 7 \u2192 6\n   - else if the original value is 8 \u2192 0\n   - else leave as is\n- Else (columns 0, 4, 5, 8? Wait, the grid is 9 columns. So columns 0, 4, 5, 8? Or other columns?)\n\nWait, the grid is 9 columns. So columns are 0-8. \n\nSo columns 1, 2, 7 are part of the first group. Columns 3-6 are the second group. The other columns are 0, 4, 5, 8? Wait, no. Columns 0, 4, 5, 8 are not part of the first or second group. \n\nWait, columns 0, 4, 5, 8 are not covered by the rules. So for these columns, the value remains the same. \n\nBut in the third example's third row, the first column is 0, which is not in the first or second group. So it remains 0. Which matches the output. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nSo the transformation is based on the column index. \n\nNow, the task is to implement this in Python. \n\nSo, the code would iterate through each cell in the grid, and for each cell, check its column index. \n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif j is in [1, 2, 7]:\n   if original value is 0 \u2192 8\n   elif original value is 7 \u2192 6\n   elif original value is 8 \u2192 0\n   else: original value\n\nelif j in [3,4,5,6]:\n   if original value is 6 \u2192 7\n   elif original value is 7 \u2192 6\n   elif original value is 8 \u2192 0\n   else: original value\n\nelse:\n   original value\n\nBut wait, in the third example's third row, column 3 is 0 \u2192 8, which is in the second group (j=3). So according to the rules, if the original value is 0, it's not in the second group's conditions (which are for 6, 7, 8). So the code would leave it as 0, but the output is 8. \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nWait, the third example's third row is:\n\nInput: 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0\n\nOutput: 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0\n\nSo for j=3 (column 3), the original value is 0. According to the rules for j in [3,4,5,6], the code would check if the original value is 6, 7, or 8. Since it's 0, it would leave it as 0. But the output is 8. \n\nThis suggests that the previous hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nSo there's a contradiction here. \n\nHmm. This indicates that the previous rules are not correct. \n\nSo what's the correct pattern? \n\nIn the third example's third row, j=3 is in the second group (columns 3-6). The original value is 0, and it's replaced with 8. \n\nSo the previous rule for the second group is incorrect. \n\nThis suggests that the rules are more complex. \n\nMaybe the rules for the second group are different. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8. \n\nBut how to determine this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rules are:\n\nFor columns 1, 2, 7:\n\n- replace 0 \u2192 8\n- replace 7 \u2192 6\n- replace 8 \u2192 0\n- else: original\n\nFor columns 3-6:\n\n- replace 0 \u2192 8\n- replace 6 \u2192 7\n- replace 7 \u2192 6\n- replace 8 \u2192 0\n- else: original\n\nBut in this case, for the third example's third row, j=3 is 0 \u2192 8, which fits. \n\nBut in the first example's sixth row, j=3-6 is 6 \u2192 7, which fits. \n\nIn the second example's second row, j=3 is 7 \u2192 6, j=4 is 8 \u2192 0, etc. \n\nThis would explain all examples. \n\nSo the transformation rules are:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif j is in [1, 2, 7]:\n   if original value is 0 \u2192 8\n   elif original value is 7 \u2192 6\n   elif original value is 8 \u2192 0\n   else: original value\n\nelif j in [3,4,5,6]:\n   if original value is 0 \u2192 8\n   elif original value is 6 \u2192 7\n   elif original value is 7 \u2192 6\n   elif original value is 8 \u2192 0\n   else: original value\n\nelse:\n   original value\n\nThis would explain the third example's third row. \n\nLet's test this:\n\nThird example's third row: j=3 is 0 \u2192 8. j=7 is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nYes, which matches the output. \n\nFor the second example's second row: j=1 is 7 \u2192 6, j=2 is 8 \u2192 0, j=3 is 7 \u2192 6, j=4 is 8 \u2192 0, j=5 is 8 \u2192 0, j=6 is 8 \u2192 0, j=7 is 8 \u2192 0. \n\nWhich matches the output. \n\nFor the first example's sixth row: j=1 is 0 \u2192 8, j=2 is 0 \u2192 8, j=3-6 are 6 \u2192 7, j=7 is 0 \u2192 8. \n\nWhich matches the output. \n\nThis seems to fit all examples. \n\nNow, the code can be written based on these rules. \n\nSo the code will loop through each cell in the grid. For each cell, check the column index, and apply the transformation based on the rules above. \n\nNow, let's write the code. \n\nThe function will take a 2D list grid, and return a new 2D list. \n\nThe code will iterate through each row and column. For each cell, apply the transformation based on the column index. \n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for j, val in enumerate(row):\n            if j in [1, 2, 7]:\n                if val == 0:\n                    new_row.append(8)\n                elif val == 7:\n                    new_row.append(6)\n                elif val == 8:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(val)\n            elif j in [3, 4, 5, 6]:\n                if val == 0:\n                    new_row.append(8)\n                elif val == 6:\n                    new_row.append(7)\n                elif val == 7:\n                    new_row.append(6)\n                elif val == 8:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(val)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, the grid is 7x9 in the examples. So the code should handle that. \n\nBut the code is general and will work for any grid. \n\nLet's test this code against the examples. \n\nExample 1: sixth row is [4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4]. \n\nFor j=1 (0 \u2192 8), j=2 (0 \u2192 8), j=3 (6 \u2192 7), j=4 (6 \u2192 7), j=5 (6 \u2192 7), j=6 (6 \u2192 7), j=7 (0 \u2192 8). So the new row is [4, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 4], which matches the example. \n\nExample 3's third row is [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]. \n\nFor j=3 (0 \u2192 8), j=7 (6 \u2192 7). So the new row is [0, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], which matches the example. \n\nExample 2's second row is [4, 7, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4]. \n\nFor j=1 (7 \u2192 6), j=2 (8 \u2192 0), j=3 (7 \u2192 6), j=4 (8 \u2192 0), j=5 (8 \u2192 0), j=6 (8 \u2192 0), j=7 (8 \u2192 0). So the new row is [4, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], which matches the example. \n\nSo this code seems to work for the examples. \n\nNow, the code must return a 7x9 grid. The input grid is 7x9, and the code will process it correctly. \n\nSo this is the transformation.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 7x9. The output seems to have some changes. Let me compare specific rows. For instance, the first row is the same in both input and output. The second row is all 6s in input and output. The third row in input is 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0. So that's the same. Wait, but the sixth row in input is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. The output for that row is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. Hmm, so the middle elements changed. Let's look at the positions. The original row is [4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4]. The output is [4, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 4]. So the second and third elements (indices 1 and 2) changed from 0 to 8, then the fourth to seventh elements (indices 3-6) changed from 6 to 7, and the eighth element (index 7) changed from 0 to 8. \n\nSo maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on some rule. Let me check other rows. For example, the seventh row in input is 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 0. The output is 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 0. So that's the same. Wait, but the sixth row in the output is different. Maybe there's a specific pattern for certain positions. \n\nLooking at Example 2. The input's sixth row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 6. The output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 6. So that's the same. But in Example 2, the second row of input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the middle elements changed. Let's see: original is [4,7,8,7,8,8,8,8,4]. Output is [4,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,4]. So the second element (7) becomes 6, third (8) becomes 0, fourth (7) becomes 6, fifth (8) becomes 0, sixth (8) becomes 0, seventh (8) becomes 0, eighth (8) becomes 0. So maybe there's some pattern here where certain positions are being replaced based on their position or some other rule.\n\nLooking at the third example. The input's first row is 6 0 6 4 6 0 0 4 6. The output is the same. The second row input is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. Output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So the fourth element (0) becomes 8, and the eighth element (0) becomes 8. The third row input is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. Output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So the fourth element (0) becomes 8, and the eighth (6) becomes 7. \n\nHmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their position. For example, in the third example, the fourth column (index 3) in some rows changes from 0 to 8, and the eighth column (index 7) changes from 6 to 7. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is related to some kind of pattern in the grid. For example, maybe certain cells are being replaced based on their neighbors. Or maybe there's a rule that replaces certain values based on their position. \n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns where the output is generated by modifying specific cells. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row changes from 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4 to 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. Let's look at the positions:\n\nOriginal: [4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4]\nOutput: [4, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 4]\n\nSo the second and third elements (indices 1 and 2) are 0 \u2192 8, then the fourth to seventh elements (indices 3-6) are 6 \u2192 7, and the eighth element (index 7) is 0 \u2192 8. \n\nSo maybe for certain positions, the value is being replaced based on some rule. For instance, if the original value is 0, it's replaced with 8, or if it's 6, it's replaced with 7. But how to determine which positions are being modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern based on the row and column indices. For example, in the sixth row of Example 1, the positions that are modified are columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7. Let me check if these positions have some relation to their positions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on some kind of pattern that's applied to certain regions of the grid. For example, maybe certain cells are being replaced based on their position relative to other cells. \n\nLooking at the third example's second row: input is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. Output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So the fourth element (index 3) is 0 \u2192 8, and the eighth element (index 7) is 0 \u2192 8. \n\nIn the third example's third row: input is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. Output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So the fourth element (index 3) is 0 \u2192 8, and the eighth element (index 7) is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nSo maybe in certain positions, the value is being replaced based on their column. For example, columns 3 and 7. Let's check for columns 3 and 7. \n\nIn the third example's third row, column 3 (index 3) is 0 \u2192 8. Column 7 (index 7) is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the fourth column (index 3) is 7 \u2192 6, but in the output it's 6. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a rule that replaces certain cells based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. \n\nLooking at the first example's sixth row, the output has 8s in columns 1, 2, 7, and 7s in columns 3-6. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the output has 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4. So the original row was 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the second element (7) becomes 6, third (8) becomes 0, fourth (7) becomes 6, fifth (8) becomes 0, sixth (8) becomes 0, seventh (8) becomes 0, eighth (8) becomes 0. \n\nThis seems like maybe the positions are being modified based on their distance from the center or some other pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid-based pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, cells in certain rows or columns are modified. \n\nAnother approach: looking for the difference between input and output. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row's output is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The original is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. So the first and last elements are the same. The middle elements (positions 1, 2, 3-6, 7) are modified. \n\nLooking at the positions that are modified in this row: columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7. So columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7. That's columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Wait, that's columns 1 to 7. But the original row is 9 columns. So maybe there's a pattern where certain columns are being modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, in row 5 (assuming rows are 0-based or 1-based?), but I need to check the examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is adjacent to certain values, it's replaced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row's output has 8s in positions 1, 2, 7, and 7s in positions 3-6. So maybe the original value is 0 \u2192 8, 6 \u2192 7. \n\nBut in the third example's third row, the fourth element (index 3) is 0 \u2192 8, and the eighth element (index 7) is 6 \u2192 7. So that seems consistent. \n\nBut in the second example's second row, the original value is 7 (position 1) \u2192 6, 8 (position 2) \u2192 0, 7 (position 3) \u2192 6, 8 (position 4) \u2192 0, etc. So that's different. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's look for patterns in the output. \n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, maybe certain cells are being replaced with 8s or 7s based on their position. For example, in the first example, the sixth row has 8s in columns 1, 2, and 7, and 7s in columns 3-6. \n\nIn the second example, the second row has 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4. So the original values were 7, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8. So the second element (7) becomes 6, third (8) becomes 0, fourth (7) becomes 6, fifth (8) becomes 0, sixth (8) becomes 0, seventh (8) becomes 0, eighth (8) becomes 0. \n\nThis seems like a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their position. For example, in the second row of example 2, the second and fourth elements are being replaced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a rule where if the original value is 0, it's replaced with 8, and if it's 6, it's replaced with 7. But that doesn't fit all examples. \n\nAnother thought: looking at the third example's second row, the output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. The original is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. So the fourth element (0) becomes 8, and the eighth (0) becomes 8. \n\nSo maybe in certain positions, the value is being replaced with 8 if it's 0, or 7 if it's 6. But in the first example's sixth row, the original has 0s and 6s, and the output has 8s and 7s. \n\nBut in the second example's second row, the original has 7 and 8, and the output has 6, 0, 6, 0, etc. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns are modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the parity of the row or column. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns are modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value. For example, if the value is 0, replace with 8, if it's 6, replace with 7. But in the second example's second row, the original value is 7, which is replaced with 6, and 8 is replaced with 0. So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe I should look for patterns in the positions that are modified. \n\nLooking at the first example's sixth row, the modified positions are columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7. That's columns 1 to 7. But the original row is 9 columns. So columns 1-7 are modified. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the modified positions are columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Wait, the original row is [4,7,8,7,8,8,8,8,4], and the output is [4,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,4]. So columns 1-7 are modified. \n\nIn the third example's second row, the modified columns are 3 and 7. \n\nThis is inconsistent. Maybe there's a different approach. \n\nAnother idea: looking for the positions that are modified in the output. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the output has 8s in columns 1, 2, and 7, and 7s in columns 3-6. \n\nIn the third example's third row, columns 3 and 7 are modified. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the value is replaced based on their column. For example, columns 3 and 7 are modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if the original value is 0, then replace with 8, if it's 6, replace with 7. But this doesn't fit the second example. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid pattern, like replacing certain cells based on their position. For example, in rows where the row index is even, certain columns are modified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, in the first example, the sixth row's output is modified in columns 1-7, but that's not consistent with other examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if the cell is in column 3 or 7, replace with 8 or 7. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nAnother approach: let's look at the outputs for the examples and see if there's a pattern in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output for the sixth row is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The original is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. So the first and last elements are the same. The middle elements are modified. \n\nIn Example 2, the second row's output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. The original is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The first and last elements are the same. The middle elements are modified. \n\nIn Example 3, the second row's output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. The original is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. The first, second, third, and last elements are the same. The fourth and eighth elements are modified. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the transformation might involve replacing certain positions in the middle of the row. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8, and if it's 6, replace with 7. But in the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8, which are replaced with 6 and 0. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and its position. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8 if it's in a certain column, or 7 if in another. \n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, in rows where the row index is 5 (assuming 0-based), certain columns are modified. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1's sixth row: the modified values are 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8. This seems like a pattern where the middle part is replaced with 7s, and the ends are 8s. \n\nIn Example 2's second row: the modified values are 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the middle part is replaced with 0s and 6s. \n\nThis is getting too vague. \n\nMaybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. For example, in certain positions, the value is replaced with 8 or 7 based on their position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, for each cell (i,j), if j is in certain columns, replace with a certain value. \n\nFor example, in the first example's sixth row, columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7 are modified. \n\nBut how to determine which columns are modified. \n\nLooking at the first example's sixth row: columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7. That's columns 1-7. But in the third example's third row, columns 3 and 7 are modified. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nAnother idea: looking for the pattern in the outputs. For example, in the first example's output, the sixth row has 8s in columns 1, 2, and 7, and 7s in columns 3-6. This could be a pattern where the middle columns are replaced with 7s, and the first and last columns are 8s. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the output has 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0. The first and last are 4 and 4. The middle columns are modified. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and its position. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8 if it's in column 1 or 2, or 7 if it's in column 3-6, or 8 if it's in column 7. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row index. For example, in rows where the row index is 5 (assuming 0-based), certain columns are modified. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and its position. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8, and if it's 6, replace with 7. \n\nBut in the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8, which are replaced with 6 and 0. So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. \n\nLooking at the third example's third row: input is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. Output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So columns 3 (index 3) is 0 \u2192 8, and column 7 (index 7) is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nSo maybe for certain columns, the value is replaced based on their position. For example, column 3 is replaced with 8 if the original is 0, and column 7 is replaced with 7 if the original is 6. \n\nBut how to determine which columns. \n\nLooking at the first example's sixth row: columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7 are modified. So columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. \n\nIn the third example's third row, columns 3 and 7 are modified. \n\nThis is inconsistent. \n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, for each cell (i,j), if j is in certain ranges, replace with certain values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and its position. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8, if it's 6, replace with 7, and if it's 7, replace with 6, and 8 with 0. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nLooking at the second example's second row: original is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. Output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the second element (7) becomes 6, third (8) becomes 0, fourth (7) becomes 6, fifth (8) becomes 0, sixth (8) becomes 0, seventh (8) becomes 0, eighth (8) becomes 0. \n\nSo this seems like a pattern where for certain positions, the value is replaced based on its original value. For example, 7 becomes 6, 8 becomes 0. \n\nBut why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value's parity. For example, if the original value is even, replace with something. But 7 is odd, 8 is even. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and its position. For example, if the original value is 7, replace with 6, and if it's 8, replace with 0. \n\nBut how to determine which positions. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. \n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. \n\nFor example, in the first example's sixth row, the modified columns are 1, 2, 3-6, 7. That's columns 1-7. So maybe for rows where the row is 5 (assuming 0-based), columns 1-7 are modified. \n\nBut how to determine the rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value being 0 or 6, and replacing them with 8 or 7. \n\nIn the first example's sixth row, the original values are 0 and 6, and the output is 8 and 7. \n\nIn the third example's third row, the original values are 0 and 6, and the output is 8 and 7. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8, which are replaced with 6 and 0. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not based on the original value but on the position. \n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in column 1 or 2, replace with 8, if in column 3-6, replace with 7, and if in column 7, replace with 8. \n\nBut this would explain the first example's sixth row. \n\nIn the third example's third row, the fourth column (index 3) is replaced with 8, and the eighth column (index 7) is replaced with 7. \n\nThis doesn't fit the previous pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, in certain rows, certain columns are modified. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the sum of its row and column indices. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nMaybe I should try to find a pattern that works for the examples. \n\nLooking at the third example's third row: input is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. Output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So columns 3 (index 3) is 0 \u2192 8, and column 7 (index 7) is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nIn the first example's sixth row: columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7 are modified. \n\nIn the second example's second row: columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are modified. \n\nThis suggests that for certain rows, the entire middle part is modified. \n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the row index. For example, for rows where the row index is 5 (assuming 0-based), the entire row is modified in certain columns. \n\nBut without knowing the row indices, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if the cell is in column 3 or 7, replace with 8 or 7. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the column index. For example, if the column is 3, replace 0 with 8, and if it's 7, replace 6 with 7. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time constraints, maybe I should try to implement a transformation that replaces certain positions with certain values based on their column. For example, in columns 3 and 7, replace 0 with 8 and 6 with 7. \n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. \n\nLooking at the third example's third row: column 3 is 0 \u2192 8, column 7 is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nIn the first example's sixth row: columns 3-6 are 6 \u2192 7, and columns 1, 2, 7 are 0 \u2192 8. \n\nSo this suggests that for columns 3-6, replace 6 with 7, and for columns 1, 2, 7, replace 0 with 8. \n\nBut in the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8, which are replaced with 6 and 0. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the column index. For example, if the column is even, replace with 8, or something like that. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven that the problem requires a Python function, and the examples are not fully clear, I'll have to make an educated guess. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is based on the following rules:\n\n- For each cell (i,j), if j is in columns 1, 2, or 7, replace 0 with 8.\n- If j is in columns 3-6, replace 6 with 7.\n- For other columns, leave as is.\n\nBut this would explain the first example's sixth row. \n\nIn the third example's third row, column 3 is 0 \u2192 8, column 7 is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8, which are not 0 or 6, so they would remain. But in the output, they are replaced. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value being 0 or 6, and replacing them with 8 or 7, but for certain columns. \n\nBut how to determine which columns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, in rows where the row index is 5 (assuming 0-based), replace certain columns. \n\nBut without more examples, this is hard. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation replaces certain cells based on their column. For example, columns 3 and 7 are modified. \n\nBut this is not enough. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8 if it's in column 1, 2, or 7, and replace with 7 if it's in column 3-6. \n\nBut this would explain the first example's sixth row. \n\nIn the third example's third row, column 3 is 0 \u2192 8, column 7 is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8, which are not 0 or 6, so they would remain. But in the output, they are replaced. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut maybe the second example's second row is an exception. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the column. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8, if it's 6, replace with 7, if it's 7, replace with 6, and if it's 8, replace with 0. \n\nBut this would explain the second example's second row. \n\nLet's test this hypothesis. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the original is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. \n\nAccording to this rule, 7 becomes 6, 8 becomes 0. So the output would be 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4, which matches the example. \n\nIn the first example's sixth row, the original is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. \n\nReplacing 0 with 8, 6 with 7: 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4, which matches the example. \n\nIn the third example's third row, the original is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. \n\nReplacing 0 with 8, 6 with 7: 0 7 7 8 0 0 0 7 0. But the actual output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the rule is not consistent. \n\nBut in the third example's third row, the output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. The original is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. So the first two elements are 0 and 6, but in the output they are unchanged. So the rule must be different. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not based on the original value but on the position. \n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the column index. For example, for columns 3 and 7, replace 0 with 8 and 6 with 7. \n\nIn the third example's third row, column 3 is 0 \u2192 8, column 7 is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nIn the first example's sixth row, columns 3-6 are 6 \u2192 7, and columns 1, 2, 7 are 0 \u2192 8. \n\nIn the second example's second row, columns 3-6 are 7 and 8, which are replaced with 6 and 0. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is based on the column index and the original value. \n\nBut how to determine the exact rules. \n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the following rules:\n\n- For columns 1 and 2: if the original value is 0, replace with 8.\n- For columns 3-6: if the original value is 6, replace with 7.\n- For column 7: if the original value is 0, replace with 8; if it's 6, replace with 7.\n- For other columns: leave as is.\n\nThis would explain the first and third examples. \n\nIn the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8 in columns 1 and 2, which are not 0, so they remain. But in the output, they are replaced with 6 and 0. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut perhaps the second example's second row is an exception, or there's another rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row index. For example, in row 5 (assuming 0-based), columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7 are modified. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation replaces certain cells based on their column. For columns 1, 2, 7, replace 0 with 8. For columns 3-6, replace 6 with 7. \n\nThis would explain the first and third examples. \n\nFor the second example's second row, the original values are 7 and 8 in columns 1 and 2, which are not 0, so they would remain. But the output shows them as 6 and 0. This suggests that this hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nBut perhaps the second example's second row is an exception, or there's another rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the column. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8 for columns 1, 2, 7; if it's 6, replace with 7 for columns 3-6. \n\nBut for other values, like 7 or 8, replace with 6 or 0. \n\nThis would explain the second example's second row. \n\nBut how to determine which values to replace. \n\nThis seems like a possible pattern. \n\nSo the transformation would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n- If j is in columns 1, 2, or 7:\n   - if the original value is 0, replace with 8\n   - else, replace with 6 if it's 7, or 0 if it's 8\n- If j is in columns 3-6:\n   - if the original value is 6, replace with 7\n   - else, replace with 6 if it's 7, or 0 if it's 8\n- Else, leave as is.\n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nThis would explain the second example's second row: columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7. \n\nOriginal values: 7, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8. \n\nFor j=1: 7 \u2192 6\nj=2: 8 \u2192 0\nj=3: 7 \u2192 6\nj=4: 8 \u2192 0\nj=5: 8 \u2192 0\nj=6: 8 \u2192 0\nj=7: 8 \u2192 0\n\nWhich matches the output: 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4.\n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nFor the first example's sixth row: columns 1, 2, 3-6, 7.\n\nOriginal values: 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0.\n\nj=1: 0 \u2192 8\nj=2: 0 \u2192 8\nj=3-6: 6 \u2192 7\nj=7: 0 \u2192 8\n\nWhich matches the output: 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4.\n\nFor the third example's third row: columns 3 and 7.\n\nOriginal values: 0 (j=3) \u2192 8, 6 (j=7) \u2192 7. \n\nWhich matches the output: 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0.\n\nThis seems to work. \n\nSo the transformation rules are:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n- If j is 1, 2, or 7:\n   - if the original value is 0 \u2192 8\n   - else if the original value is 7 \u2192 6\n   - else if the original value is 8 \u2192 0\n   - else leave as is\n- If j is 3-6:\n   - if the original value is 6 \u2192 7\n   - else if the original value is 7 \u2192 6\n   - else if the original value is 8 \u2192 0\n   - else leave as is\n- Else (columns 0, 4, 5, 8? Wait, the grid is 9 columns. So columns 0, 4, 5, 8? Or other columns?)\n\nWait, the grid is 9 columns. So columns are 0-8. \n\nSo columns 1, 2, 7 are part of the first group. Columns 3-6 are the second group. The other columns are 0, 4, 5, 8? Wait, no. Columns 0, 4, 5, 8 are not part of the first or second group. \n\nWait, columns 0, 4, 5, 8 are not covered by the rules. So for these columns, the value remains the same. \n\nBut in the third example's third row, the first column is 0, which is not in the first or second group. So it remains 0. Which matches the output. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nSo the transformation is based on the column index. \n\nNow, the task is to implement this in Python. \n\nSo, the code would iterate through each cell in the grid, and for each cell, check its column index. \n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif j is in [1, 2, 7]:\n   if original value is 0 \u2192 8\n   elif original value is 7 \u2192 6\n   elif original value is 8 \u2192 0\n   else: original value\n\nelif j in [3,4,5,6]:\n   if original value is 6 \u2192 7\n   elif original value is 7 \u2192 6\n   elif original value is 8 \u2192 0\n   else: original value\n\nelse:\n   original value\n\nBut wait, in the third example's third row, column 3 is 0 \u2192 8, which is in the second group (j=3). So according to the rules, if the original value is 0, it's not in the second group's conditions (which are for 6, 7, 8). So the code would leave it as 0, but the output is 8. \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nWait, the third example's third row is:\n\nInput: 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0\n\nOutput: 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0\n\nSo for j=3 (column 3), the original value is 0. According to the rules for j in [3,4,5,6], the code would check if the original value is 6, 7, or 8. Since it's 0, it would leave it as 0. But the output is 8. \n\nThis suggests that the previous hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nSo there's a contradiction here. \n\nHmm. This indicates that the previous rules are not correct. \n\nSo what's the correct pattern? \n\nIn the third example's third row, j=3 is in the second group (columns 3-6). The original value is 0, and it's replaced with 8. \n\nSo the previous rule for the second group is incorrect. \n\nThis suggests that the rules are more complex. \n\nMaybe the rules for the second group are different. For example, if the original value is 0, replace with 8. \n\nBut how to determine this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rules are:\n\nFor columns 1, 2, 7:\n\n- replace 0 \u2192 8\n- replace 7 \u2192 6\n- replace 8 \u2192 0\n- else: original\n\nFor columns 3-6:\n\n- replace 0 \u2192 8\n- replace 6 \u2192 7\n- replace 7 \u2192 6\n- replace 8 \u2192 0\n- else: original\n\nBut in this case, for the third example's third row, j=3 is 0 \u2192 8, which fits. \n\nBut in the first example's sixth row, j=3-6 is 6 \u2192 7, which fits. \n\nIn the second example's second row, j=3 is 7 \u2192 6, j=4 is 8 \u2192 0, etc. \n\nThis would explain all examples. \n\nSo the transformation rules are:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif j is in [1, 2, 7]:\n   if original value is 0 \u2192 8\n   elif original value is 7 \u2192 6\n   elif original value is 8 \u2192 0\n   else: original value\n\nelif j in [3,4,5,6]:\n   if original value is 0 \u2192 8\n   elif original value is 6 \u2192 7\n   elif original value is 7 \u2192 6\n   elif original value is 8 \u2192 0\n   else: original value\n\nelse:\n   original value\n\nThis would explain the third example's third row. \n\nLet's test this:\n\nThird example's third row: j=3 is 0 \u2192 8. j=7 is 6 \u2192 7. \n\nYes, which matches the output. \n\nFor the second example's second row: j=1 is 7 \u2192 6, j=2 is 8 \u2192 0, j=3 is 7 \u2192 6, j=4 is 8 \u2192 0, j=5 is 8 \u2192 0, j=6 is 8 \u2192 0, j=7 is 8 \u2192 0. \n\nWhich matches the output. \n\nFor the first example's sixth row: j=1 is 0 \u2192 8, j=2 is 0 \u2192 8, j=3-6 are 6 \u2192 7, j=7 is 0 \u2192 8. \n\nWhich matches the output. \n\nThis seems to fit all examples. \n\nNow, the code can be written based on these rules. \n\nSo the code will loop through each cell in the grid. For each cell, check the column index, and apply the transformation based on the rules above. \n\nNow, let's write the code. \n\nThe function will take a 2D list grid, and return a new 2D list. \n\nThe code will iterate through each row and column. For each cell, apply the transformation based on the column index. \n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for j, val in enumerate(row):\n            if j in [1, 2, 7]:\n                if val == 0:\n                    new_row.append(8)\n                elif val == 7:\n                    new_row.append(6)\n                elif val == 8:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(val)\n            elif j in [3, 4, 5, 6]:\n                if val == 0:\n                    new_row.append(8)\n                elif val == 6:\n                    new_row.append(7)\n                elif val == 7:\n                    new_row.append(6)\n                elif val == 8:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(val)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, the grid is 7x9 in the examples. So the code should handle that. \n\nBut the code is general and will work for any grid. \n\nLet's test this code against the examples. \n\nExample 1: sixth row is [4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4]. \n\nFor j=1 (0 \u2192 8), j=2 (0 \u2192 8), j=3 (6 \u2192 7), j=4 (6 \u2192 7), j=5 (6 \u2192 7), j=6 (6 \u2192 7), j=7 (0 \u2192 8). So the new row is [4, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 4], which matches the example. \n\nExample 3's third row is [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]. \n\nFor j=3 (0 \u2192 8), j=7 (6 \u2192 7). So the new row is [0, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], which matches the example. \n\nExample 2's second row is [4, 7, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4]. \n\nFor j=1 (7 \u2192 6), j=2 (8 \u2192 0), j=3 (7 \u2192 6), j=4 (8 \u2192 0), j=5 (8 \u2192 0), j=6 (8 \u2192 0), j=7 (8 \u2192 0). So the new row is [4, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], which matches the example. \n\nSo this code seems to work for the examples. \n\nNow, the code must return a 7x9 grid. The input grid is 7x9, and the code will process it correctly. \n\nSo this is the transformation.\n"
