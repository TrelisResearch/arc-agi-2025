The output seems to be a vertical expansion of the input grid, with the middle rows being duplicated.\n4. The first and last rows of the input are replicated in the output.\n5. The middle rows (rows 1 and 2 of the input) are duplicated in the output, but with an additional row in between.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Keeping the first and last rows of the input as they are.\n- Duplicating the middle rows (rows 1 and 2 of the input) in the output, with an additional row in between.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The output grid is 5 rows by 12 columns\n    transformed_grid = []\n    \n    # First row is the same as the first row of the input\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[0])\n    \n    # Middle rows: duplicate rows 1 and 2 of the input, with an additional row in between\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[1] + [0] * 3)  # Add 3 zeros to make it 12 columns\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[2] + [0] * 3)  # Add 3 zeros to make it 12 columns\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[1] + [0] * 3)  # Add 3 zeros to make it 12 columns\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[3])  # Last row is the same as the last row of the input\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The output grid is 5 rows by 12 columns\n    transformed_grid = []\n    \n    # First row is the same as the first row of the input\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[0])\n    \n    # Middle rows: duplicate rows 1 and 2 of the input, with an additional row in between\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[1] + [0] * 3)  # Add 3 zeros to make it 12 columns\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[2] + [0] * 3)  # Add 3 zeros to make it 12 columns\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[1] + [0] * 3)  # Add 3 zeros to make it 12 columns\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[3])  # Last row is the same as the last row of the input\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "Looking at the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid is always 5 rows by 12 columns.\n2. The input grid is 5 rows by 9 columns.\n3. The output seems to be a vertical expansion of the input grid, with the middle rows being duplicated.\n4. The first and last rows of the input are replicated in the output.\n5. The middle rows (rows 1 and 2 of the input) are duplicated in the output, but with an additional row in between.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Keeping the first and last rows of the input as they are.\n- Duplicating the middle rows (rows 1 and 2 of the input) in the output, with an additional row in between.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The output grid is 5 rows by 12 columns\n    transformed_grid = []\n    \n    # First row is the same as the first row of the input\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[0])\n    \n    # Middle rows: duplicate rows 1 and 2 of the input, with an additional row in between\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[1] + [0] * 3)  # Add 3 zeros to make it 12 columns\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[2] + [0] * 3)  # Add 3 zeros to make it 12 columns\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[1] + [0] * 3)  # Add 3 zeros to make it 12 columns\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[3])  # Last row is the same as the last row of the input\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The output grid is 5 rows by 12 columns\n    transformed_grid = []\n    \n    # First row is the same as the first row of the input\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[0])\n    \n    # Middle rows: duplicate rows 1 and 2 of the input, with an additional row in between\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[1] + [0] * 3)  # Add 3 zeros to make it 12 columns\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[2] + [0] * 3)  # Add 3 zeros to make it 12 columns\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[1] + [0] * 3)  # Add 3 zeros to make it 12 columns\n    transformed_grid.append(grid[3])  # Last row is the same as the last row of the input\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
