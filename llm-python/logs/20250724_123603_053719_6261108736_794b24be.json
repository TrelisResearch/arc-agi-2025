    "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to identify the pattern.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice:\n1. The output grids are always 3\u00d73\n2. The top row seems to have 2's based on the presence of 1's in the input\n3. The middle row sometimes has 2's, but only in specific positions\n4. The bottom row is mostly zeros\n\nLet me examine more carefully:\n\nExample 1: 1 at (1,0) \u2192 2 at (0,0)\nExample 2: 1's at (0,1) and (1,0) \u2192 2's at (0,0) and (0,1)\nExample 3: 1's at (0,2) and (2,0) \u2192 2's at (0,0) and (0,1)\nExample 5: 1 at (0,2) \u2192 2 at (0,0)\nExample 6: 1's at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0) \u2192 2's at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n\nIt looks like:\n- For the top row: if there's any 1 in the input, we place 2's in the top row\n- The number of 2's in the top row seems related to how many 1's are in the input or their positions\n- For middle/bottom rows: there might be a specific pattern based on 1's positions\n\nLet me look at when middle row has 2's:\nExample 8: 1's at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2) \u2192 2's in top row, and one 2 at (1,1)\nExample 9: 1's at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0) \u2192 2's in top row, and one 2 at (1,1)\nExample 10: 1's at (0,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) \u2192 2's in top row, and one 2 at (1,1)\n\nI think I see a pattern:\n1. Top row gets 2's based on some aggregation of 1's positions\n2. Position (1,1) gets a 2 if there are 1's in multiple rows/columns or specific configurations\n3. Maybe it's about counting 1's per row/column and mapping that somehow\n\nLooking more carefully at the top row:\n- It seems like the top row is filled with 2's from left to right based on how \"connected\" the 1's are or total count\n\nActually, let me look at this differently:\n- If there's a single 1, we get one 2 in top row\n- If there are 2 connected 1's or 2 separate 1's, we get two 2's \n- If there are 3 or more connected/separated 1's, we get three 2's\n\nFor the special middle position (1,1):\n- It becomes 2 when there are 1's in at least 3 different positions, possibly forming some kind of pattern\n\nLet me try a different approach. Looking at the count of 1's:\n- 1 one \u2192 1 two in top row\n- 2 ones \u2192 2 twos in top row  \n- 3 ones \u2192 3 twos in top row\n- 4 ones \u2192 3 twos in top row + 1 two in middle\n\nActually, let me check if it's about connected components or specific positions:\n\nLooking at examples where (1,1) becomes 2:\nExample 8: (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2) - 4 positions, (1,1) = 2\nExample 9: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0) - 4 positions, (1,1) = 2  \nExample 10: (0,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) - 4 positions, (1,1) = 2\n\nSo when there are 4 or more 1's, position (1,1) becomes 2.\n\nFor the top row, it seems to be the count of 1's, capped at 3.\n\nLet me verify:\n- 1 one \u2192 1 two\n- 2 ones \u2192 2 twos  \n- 3 ones \u2192 3 twos\n- 4 ones \u2192 3 twos + (1,1) = 2\n\nThis looks promising!\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Count total number of 1's\n    count_ones = sum(row.count(1) for row in grid)\n    \n    # Create output grid filled with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Fill top row with 2's, up to min(count_ones, 3)\n    for i in range(min(count_ones, 3)):\n        output[0][i] = 2\n    \n    # If there are 4 or more 1's, place a 2 at position (1,1)\n    if count_ones >= 4:\n        output[1][1] = 2\n        \n    return output\n```",

The bottom row is mostly all zeros\n\nLet me examine more carefully:\n\nExample 1: 1 at (1,0) \u2192 2 at (0,0)\nExample 2: 1's at (0,1) and (1,0) \u2192 2's at (0,0) and (0,1)\nExample 5: 1 at (0,2) \u2192 2 at (0,0) (only one 2, not at (0,2))\n\nIt seems like the top row of the output indicates some kind of \"projection\" or \"summary\" of 1's in the input.\n\nLooking at more complex examples:\nExample 6: 1's at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0) \u2192 2's at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\nExample 8: 1's at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2) \u2192 2's at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) and (1,1)\n\nLet me try to understand the rules:\n1. Top row: For each column in the input, if there's any 1 in that column, place a 2 in the corresponding position in the top row of output\n2. Middle row: This seems more complex. Looking at examples where middle row has 2's...\n   - Example 8: 1's form a pattern with (2,2) having a 1, and we get a 2 at (1,1)\n   - Example 9: Similar pattern\n   - Example 10: 1's at (0,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) \u2192 2 at (1,1)\n\nIt looks like:\n- If there are 1's in multiple rows AND columns, there might be a 2 at position (1,1) \n- Or possibly: if there's a 1 at both (2,0) and (2,2), then (1,1) gets a 2\n- Or maybe: if there are 1's in all three rows, then (1,1) gets a 2\n\nLet me look at example 7 vs example 2:\n- Example 7: 1's in rows 0 and 1 \u2192 (1,1) gets 2\n- Example 2: 1's in rows 0 and 1 \u2192 no 2 at (1,1)\n\nHmm, let me reconsider. Let me check the number of 1's:\n- Example 6: 3 ones \u2192 three 2's in first row, one 2 in (1,1)\n- Example 7: 3 ones \u2192 three 2's in first row, one 2 in (1,1)\n- Example 8: 4 ones \u2192 three 2's in first row, one 2 in (1,1)\n- Example 9: 4 ones \u2192 three 2's in first row, one 2 in (1,1)\n- Example 10: 4 ones \u2192 three 2's in first row, one 2 in (1,1)\n\nSo when there are 3 or more 1's, we get a 2 at (1,1)?\n\nLet me also check if there's a pattern with corners:\n- Example 8: 1's at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2) - all four corners except (0,2) and (2,1)\n- Example 9: 1's at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0) \n- Example 10: 1's at (0,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nActually, let me look at the middle row pattern again:\nIt seems like (1,1) gets a 2 when there are multiple 1's in different rows/columns.\n\nLet me try a hypothesis:\n1. Top row: For each column j, if there's any 1 in column j of input, put 2 in output[0][j]\n2. Middle row: Only (1,1) can be 2, and it's 2 when there are 3 or more 1's in the input\n3. Bottom row: Always 0\n\nWait, let me double-check this with example 6:\nInput has 1's at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0) = 3 ones\nOutput has 2's at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) - why (0,2)?\n\nThat doesn't match. Let me recheck...\n\nActually looking at example 6 input:\n1 1 0\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n\nThe 1's are at positions (0,0), (0,1), (2,0). That's 3 ones.\nOutput is:\n2 2 2\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nSo (0,2) also gets a 2 even though column 2 has no 1's.\n\nLet me try a different approach. What if:\n1. Top row: Count how many 1's are in each row of input. Place that many 2's from left in top row.\n2. Middle row: (1,1) is 2 if total count of 1's >= 3\n3. Bottom row: Always 0\n\nFor example 6:\nRow 0 has 2 ones, row 1 has 0 ones, row 2 has 1 one.\nTop row gets 2 2 2 (three 2's because we have 3 ones total)\nMiddle (1,1) = 0 because... no, we have 3 ones total so it should be 2. But it's 0.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me restart with a cleaner analysis.\n\nLet me count 1's and see the output top row length:\n- Example 1: 1 one \u2192 1 two in top row\n- Example 2: 2 ones \u2192 2 twos in top row  \n- Example 5: 1 one \u2192 1 two in top row\n- Example 6: 3 ones \u2192 3 twos in top row\n- Example 7: 3 ones \u2192 3 twos in top row\n\nSo top row has as many 2's as there are 1's in input, placed from left.\n\nFor middle row:\n- Example 1: 1 one \u2192 no 2 in middle\n- Example 2: 2 ones \u2192 no 2 in middle\n- Example 6: 3 ones \u2192 no 2 in middle  \n- Example 7: 3 ones \u2192 no 2 in middle\n- Example 8: 4 ones \u2192 2 in middle (1,1)\n- Example 9: 4 ones \u2192 2 in middle (1,1)\n- Example 10: 4 ones \u2192 2 in middle (1,1)\n\nSo when there are 4 or more 1's, we get a 2 at (1,1).\n\nBut example 3 has 2 ones and output top row is 2 2 0. That's 2 twos for 2 ones. Correct.\n\nWait, example 4: 2 ones, output top row is 2 2 0. Correct.\n\nLet me verify my understanding:\n1. Count total 1's in input\n2. Top row: Place that many 2's from the left\n3. Position (1,1): 2 if total 1's >= 4, otherwise 0\n4. All other positions: 0\n\nLet me double-check:\nExample 1: 1 one \u2192 top 2 0 0, middle 0 0 0, bottom 0 0 0 \u2713\nExample 2: 2 ones \u2192 top 2 2 0, middle 0 0 0, bottom 0 0 0 \u2713\nExample 3: 2 ones \u2192 top 2 2 0, middle 0 0 0, bottom 0 0 0 \u2713\nExample 4: 2 ones \u2192 top 2 2 0, middle 0 0 0, bottom 0 0 0 \u2713\nExample 5: 1 one \u2192 top 2 0 0, middle 0 0 0, bottom 0 0 0 \u2713\nExample 6: 3 ones \u2192 top 2 2 2, middle 0 0 0, bottom 0 0 0 \u2713\nExample 7: 3 ones \u2192 top 2 2 2, middle 0 0 0, bottom 0 0 0 \u2713\nExample 8: 4 ones \u2192 top 2 2 2, middle 0 2 0, bottom 0 0",

Most outputs have 2s in the first row, and 0s elsewhere, except for some cases\n3. Let me examine what determines the pattern more carefully\n\nLet me trace through a few examples:\n- Example 1: 1 at (1,0) \u2192 2 at (0,0)\n- Example 2: 1s at (0,1) and (1,0) \u2192 2s at (0,0) and (0,1)\n- Example 5: 1 at (0,2) \u2192 2 at (0,0)\n- Example 6: 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0) \u2192 2s at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n\nIt seems like there's a mapping from input positions to output positions in the first row.\n\nLet me look at more complex examples:\n- Example 8: 1s at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2) \u2192 2s at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1)\n- Example 9: 1s at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0) \u2192 2s at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1)\n- Example 10: 1s at (0,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) \u2192 2s at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1)\n\nI notice that when there are 1s in multiple positions, especially forming certain patterns, we get 2s in the (1,1) position and sometimes (2,1).\n\nLet me think about this differently. Looking at the simpler cases:\n- It seems like the first row of the output is determined by some projection of the input\n- The pattern might be: count 1s in columns and put 2s in the first row accordingly\n- Or it could be about connectivity/components\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- If there's a 1 in column 0, we put a 2 in output position (0,0)\n- If there's a 1 in column 1, we put a 2 in output position (0,1)  \n- If there's a 1 in column 2, we put a 2 in output position (0,2)\n\nBut that's not quite right looking at example 8.\n\nLet me check if it's about connected components or specific patterns:\n- When we have 4+ 1s in certain arrangements, we get a 2 at (1,1)\n- When we have 3+ 1s, we fill the first row with 2s\n\nActually, let me look at the count of 1s:\n- Examples with 1 one: 2 in first row at specific positions\n- Examples with 2 ones: 2s in first row at specific positions  \n- Examples with 3 ones: first row filled with 2s\n- Examples with 4 ones: first row filled with 2s AND a 2 at (1,1)\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n1. If there are 3 or more 1s in the input, fill the entire first row with 2s\n2. If there are 4 or more 1s, also put a 2 at position (1,1)\n3. For the position (2,1), it seems to appear when there are specific arrangements\n\nLooking at example 8: 1s at (0,0),(0,1),(2,0),(2,2) - this creates a pattern where we might put 2 at (1,1) and (2,1)\nLooking at example 10: 1s at (0,0),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2) - similar pattern\n\nThe (2,1) seems to appear when there's some kind of \"cross\" pattern or when there are 1s in both the first and last rows.\n\nLet me try a hypothesis:\n1. Count total 1s\n2. If count >= 3, fill first row with 2s\n3. If count >= 4, put 2 at (1,1) \n4. For (2,1), it seems to appear when there are 1s in positions that create certain patterns\n\nActually, let me recheck example 8 and 9 which both have 4 ones:\n- Example 8: (0,0),(0,1),(2,0),(2,2) \u2192 2 at (1,1) and (2,1)\n- Example 9: (0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(2,0) \u2192 2 at (1,1) and (2,1) \n- Example 10: (0,0),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2) \u2192 2 at (1,1) and (2,1)\n\nIt seems like when we have 4 ones, we get 2s in first row, (1,1), and (2,1).\n\nBut looking at examples with 3 ones:\n- Example 6: (0,0),(0,1),(2,0) \u2192 first row filled with 2s\n- Example 7: (0,1),(1,0),(1,1) \u2192 first row filled with 2s\n\nLet me try another approach. What if:\n1. First row: Project columns - if any column has a 1, put 2 in that column of first row\n2. For (1,1): Appears when there are multiple connected components or specific arrangements\n3. For (2,1): Appears in more complex arrangements\n\nActually, re-examining example 1: only (0,0) \u2192 (1,0) mapping? No, that's (1,0) input \u2192 (0,0) output.\n\nLet me restart with a cleaner approach:\n\nLooking at where 1s in input map to 2s in output:\n- Input (0,0) seems to influence output (0,0) \n- Input (0,1) seems to influence output (0,1)\n- Input (0,2) seems to influence output (0,2)\n- Input (1,0) seems to influence output (0,0)\n- Input (1,1) seems to influence output (0,1) \n- Input (1,2) seems to influence output (0,2)\n- Input (2,0) seems to influence output (0,0)\n- Input (2,1) seems to influence output (0,1)\n- Input (2,2) seems to influence output (0,2)\n\nSo it looks like we're OR-ing each column: if any position in column j has a 1, put a 2 at (0,j).\n\nFor the other positions:\n- (1,1) gets 2 when there are complex arrangements (4+ connected ones?)\n- (2,1) gets 2 in even more specific cases\n\nLet me check if it's about connectivity:\nExamples 8, 9, 10 all have 4 ones with specific patterns that make them \"connected\" in different ways.\n\nActually, looking at example 8 more carefully:\n1s at: (0,0) (0,1) (2,0) (2,2) - these form a pattern where (1,1) and (2,1) get 2s\nThe commonality might be having 1s in both first and last row.\n\nFor (1,1) to be 2: maybe when we have 1s in at least 3 different rows?\nFor (2,1) to be 2: maybe when we have 1s in all 3 rows?\n\nLet me verify:\n- Example 8: rows 0,2 have 1s \u2192 2 rows, so (1,1) = 2, (2,1) = 2\n- Example 9: rows 0,1,2 have 1s \u2192 3 rows, so (1,1) = 2, (2,1) = 2  \n- Example 10: rows 0,1,2 have 1s \u2192 3 rows, so (1,1) = 2, (2,1) = 2\n\nBut example 7: rows 0,1 have 1s \u2192 2 rows, so (1,1) = 2, but (2,1) = 0\n\nHmm, let me count rows with 1s:\n- Example 7: rows 0,1 \u2192 (1,1) = 2, (2,1) = 0\n- Example 8: rows 0,2 \u2192 (1,1) = 2, (2,1) = 2\n- Example 9: rows 0,1,2 \u2192 (1,1) = 2, (2,1) = 2\n- Example 10: rows 0",

The top row seems to have 2's based on the presence of 1's in the input\n3. The middle row sometimes has 2's, but only in specific positions\n4. The bottom row is mostly zeros\n\nLet me examine more carefully:\n\nExample 1: 1 at (1,0) \u2192 2 at (0,0)\nExample 2: 1's at (0,1) and (1,0) \u2192 2's at (0,0) and (0,1)\nExample 3: 1's at (0,2) and (2,0) \u2192 2's at (0,0) and (0,1)\nExample 5: 1 at (0,2) \u2192 2 at (0,0)\nExample 6: 1's at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0) \u2192 2's at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n\nIt looks like:\n- For the top row: if there's any 1 in the input, we place 2's in the top row\n- The number of 2's in the top row seems related to how many 1's are in the input or their positions\n- For middle/bottom rows: there might be a specific pattern based on 1's positions\n\nLet me look at when middle row has 2's:\nExample 8: 1's at (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2) \u2192 2's in top row, and one 2 at (1,1)\nExample 9: 1's at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0) \u2192 2's in top row, and one 2 at (1,1)\nExample 10: 1's at (0,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) \u2192 2's in top row, and one 2 at (1,1)\n\nI think I see a pattern:\n1. Top row gets 2's based on some aggregation of 1's positions\n2. Position (1,1) gets a 2 if there are 1's in multiple rows/columns or specific configurations\n3. Maybe it's about counting 1's per row/column and mapping that somehow\n\nLooking more carefully at the top row:\n- It seems like the top row is filled with 2's from left to right based on how \"connected\" the 1's are or total count\n\nActually, let me look at this differently:\n- If there's a single 1, we get one 2 in top row\n- If there are 2 connected 1's or 2 separate 1's, we get two 2's \n- If there are 3 or more connected/separated 1's, we get three 2's\n\nFor the special middle position (1,1):\n- It becomes 2 when there are 1's in at least 3 different positions, possibly forming some kind of pattern\n\nLet me try a different approach. Looking at the count of 1's:\n- 1 one \u2192 1 two in top row\n- 2 ones \u2192 2 twos in top row  \n- 3 ones \u2192 3 twos in top row\n- 4 ones \u2192 3 twos in top row + 1 two in middle\n\nActually, let me check if it's about connected components or specific positions:\n\nLooking at examples where (1,1) becomes 2:\nExample 8: (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2) - 4 positions, (1,1) = 2\nExample 9: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0) - 4 positions, (1,1) = 2  \nExample 10: (0,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) - 4 positions, (1,1) = 2\n\nSo when there are 4 or more 1's, position (1,1) becomes 2.\n\nFor the top row, it seems to be the count of 1's, capped at 3.\n\nLet me verify:\n- 1 one \u2192 1 two\n- 2 ones \u2192 2 twos  \n- 3 ones \u2192 3 twos\n- 4 ones \u2192 3 twos + (1,1) = 2\n\nThis looks promising!\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Count total number of 1's\n    count_ones = sum(row.count(1) for row in grid)\n    \n    # Create output grid filled with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Fill top row with 2's, up to min(count_ones, 3)\n    for i in range(min(count_ones, 3)):\n        output[0][i] = 2\n    \n    # If there are 4 or more 1's, place a 2 at position (1,1)\n    if count_ones >= 4:\n        output[1][1] = 2\n        \n    return output\n```",
