          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the examples provided. Let's look at the first example to see what's going on.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a lot of 2s and 3s, and the output has some 1s and 2s. For instance, the third row of the input has a bunch of 3s, and the output has some 1s and 3s. Looking at the output, there's a transformation where certain positions are replaced with 1s. Maybe the 1s are replacing some of the 2s or 3s in specific regions?\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output, the third row of the input is 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 3 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. So the fifth and sixth elements (indices 4 and 5) in the input are 3s, but in the output they become 1s. Wait, but the output's fifth element is 1, sixth is 1, and seventh is 1. Wait, the original input's third row is 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output third row is 0 0 0 3 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. So the fifth, sixth, seventh elements (indices 4,5,6) are 1s. But in the input, those positions were 3s. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 1s based on some rule.\n\nLooking further, in the input, there's a 2 in the first row, and in the output, that 2 is replaced with 2. But in the output's first row, the seventh and eighth elements are 2 and 2. Wait, the input first row is all 0s except for positions 6 and 7 (assuming 0-based index) which are 2 and 2. The output first row has 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 ... So those 2s remain. So maybe the 2s are preserved, but other numbers are transformed.\n\nLooking at the second example, the input has a 2 in some positions, and the output has 1s in some places. For example, in the second example's input, the third row is 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3. The output for that row is 0 0 3 3 3 1 1 1 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3. So the sixth and seventh elements (indices 5 and 6) in the input are 3s, but in the output they are 1s. So again, replacing 3s with 1s in certain positions.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the first example, the output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to 2s or 3s. For instance, in the first example's input, there's a 2 in the first row, and the output's first row has 2s in the same positions. But in the third row, there's a 2 in the first column (input row 2, column 0?), and in the output, that's 0. Wait, no, looking at the first example's input and output:\n\nInput row 2 (third row) is 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. Output row 2 is 0 0 0 3 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. So the fifth, sixth, seventh elements (indices 4,5,6) are 1s. So maybe those positions are being replaced with 1s because they are adjacent to a 2? Let me check the input. In the input, there's a 2 in row 0, column 6 (assuming 0-based) and row 7, column 0. Wait, looking at the first example's input:\n\nThe input's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So in row 0, column 6 and 7 are 2s. Then in the output, those positions are 2s. But in the third row (input row 2), the 3s are being replaced with 1s in positions 4-6. Maybe there's a pattern where certain regions are being transformed based on proximity to 2s or 3s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in certain regions. For example, in the first example, the output has 1s in positions that are part of a rectangle or some shape. Let me think about the first example's output. The third row has 1s in positions 4-6. The fourth row has 1s in positions 4 and 5 (maybe?), and so on. It seems like there's a pattern where certain areas are being transformed into 1s, possibly based on their position relative to other numbers.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output is 1. For example, in the first example's output, the third row's positions 4-6 are 1s. In the fourth row, positions 4 and 5 are 1s. In the fifth row, positions 4-6 are 1s. In the sixth row, positions 4-6 are 1s. Wait, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in a certain region. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in certain regions that are adjacent to 2s. For instance, in the first example, the input has a 2 in row 0, column 6 and 7. Then, in the third row, the 3s are being replaced with 1s in positions that are adjacent to that 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape. For example, in the first example's output, the third row's 1s are in a horizontal line. Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in certain regions that are part of a larger structure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the first example's output, the 1s seem to be replacing 3s in positions that form a certain pattern. For example, in the third row, the 1s are in positions 4-6. In the fourth row, positions 4 and 5. In the fifth row, positions 4-6. In the sixth row, positions 4-6. Then in the seventh row, positions 4-6 are 1s. Wait, but in the seventh row of the first example's input, the input is 2 0 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 2 0 2 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. So the fourth, fifth, sixth positions (indices 3-5) are 1s. So that's a horizontal line of 1s in positions 3-5. Then in the eighth row, the input is 0 0 0 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 1 2 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. So the fourth position (index 3) is 1, and the sixth (index 5) is 1. So maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to a 2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are replacing 3s in certain positions that are part of a specific pattern. For example, in the first example, the output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to the 2s in the input. For instance, the first 2 is at (0,6) and (0,7). The third row's 1s are in positions (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). Maybe those positions are adjacent to the 2s? Or maybe they are in a certain region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape. For example, in the first example's output, the third row's 1s form a horizontal line, and the fourth row has a 1 in the middle. Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in a certain shape that is determined by the input's 2s.\n\nAnother approach: look at the second example. The input has a 2 in some positions, and the output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the third row of the second example's input, there's a 3 in position 0, then a series of 3s. The output has 3s in the same positions, but some are replaced with 1s. For example, the third row of the input is 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3. The output is 0 0 3 3 3 1 1 1 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3. So the sixth and seventh elements (indices 5 and 6) are 1s. Maybe this is part of a pattern where the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to a 2.\n\nLooking at the second example's input, there's a 2 in row 12, column 0. The output in that row has 1s in certain positions. Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to the 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are part of a certain shape, such as a cross or a rectangle. For example, in the first example, the third row's 1s form a horizontal line. In the fourth row, there's a 1 in the middle. Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are part of a certain shape based on the input's 2s.\n\nAnother idea: the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in positions that are adjacent to the 2s. For instance, the 2 in row 0, column 6 is at (0,6). The third row's 1s are in positions (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). These positions are in a line that's adjacent to the 2 in row 0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region. For example, the 1s form a vertical line in the middle of the grid. But I need to find a consistent pattern.\n\nLooking at the third example's input and output. The input has a 2 in some positions and the output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the third example's input, the third row is 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 3 3 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So the fourth, fifth, sixth elements (indices 3-5) are 1s. The input's third row has 3s in positions 1-3, and the output replaces those with 1s in positions 3-5. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again. The input's third row is 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 3 3 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So the fourth, fifth, sixth elements (indices 3,4,5) are 1s. The original input's third row has 3s in positions 1-4. But the output's third row has 1s in positions 3-5. So maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to a 2?\n\nIn the third example's input, there's a 2 in row 0, column 5. The output's third row has 1s in positions 3-5. So maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to the 2.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is that whenever there's a 2 in the input, certain positions around it are replaced with 1s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region, like a square or a rectangle. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a horizontal line in the third row. But that's not consistent across all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape determined by the input's 2s. For example, in the first example, the 2 is at (0,6) and (0,7). The 1s in the third row are in positions (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). These positions are directly below the 2s? But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output is 1. For example, in the first example's output, the third row's 1s are in positions (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). The fourth row has (3,4), (3,5). The fifth row has (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). The sixth row has (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). The seventh row has (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). The eighth row has (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). The ninth row has (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). The tenth row has (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). The eleventh row has (10,3), (10,4), (10,5). The twelfth row has (11,3), (11,4), (11,5). The thirteenth row has (12,3), (12,4), (12,5). The fourteenth row has (13,3), (13,4), (13,5). The fifteenth row has (14,3), (14,4), (14,5). The sixteenth row has (15,3), (15,4), (15,5). The seventeenth row has (16,3), (16,4), (16,5). The eighteenth row has (17,3), (17,4), (17,5). The nineteenth row has (18,3), (18,4), (18,5). The twentieth row has (19,3), (19,4), (19,5). \n\nWait, this seems like a vertical line of 1s in the middle of the grid. But that can't be right. Wait, looking at the first example's output, the third row has 1s in positions 4-6, which are columns 4,5,6. Then in the fourth row, positions 4 and 5. Wait, maybe the 1s are in a certain pattern that forms a rectangle or a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are part of a certain shape based on the input's 2s. For example, the 2s in the input are at certain positions, and the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to those 2s. \n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region around the 2s. For example, in the first example, the 2s are in the first row, and the 1s are in the third row, which is two rows below. But that's not a clear pattern.\n\nAnother idea: the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a horizontal line in the third row, then a vertical line in the fourth row, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first example's output, the third row has 1s in positions 4-6, which are part of a horizontal line. The fourth row has 1s in positions 4 and 5. The fifth row has 1s in 4-6. This seems like a horizontal line that's expanding. Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are part of a certain shape determined by the input's 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape, like a rectangle. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a rectangle in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. Since the output has 1s replacing 3s in certain positions, perhaps the transformation is to replace 3s with 1s in certain regions. But what regions?\n\nLooking at the first example's input, the 3s are in certain positions. The output replaces some of them with 1s. For example, in the third row of the input, there's a 3 in position 3, and in the output, it's 3. But in position 4, it's 1. So maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to a 2. For example, the 2 in row 0, column 6 is adjacent to the 3 in row 1, column 6. But in the output, the 3 in row 2, column 4 is replaced with 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape. For example, in the first example's output, the 1s form a vertical line in the middle of the grid. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain pattern based on the input's 2s. For example, the 2s in the input are at certain positions, and the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain distance from those 2s.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's look at the third example. The input has a 2 in row 0, column 5. The output has 1s in row 2, columns 3-5. So maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are two rows below the 2. But that's just one example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape. For example, in the third example, the 1s form a horizontal line in the middle of the row. So maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain pattern based on the input's 2s.\n\nAnother idea: the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape, such as a cross or a square. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a horizontal line in the third row, but that's just one part of a larger pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are part of a certain region. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in a vertical line that starts from the third row and goes down. But how?\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as replacing certain positions with 1s based on the presence of 2s in the input. For example, if a 2 is present in the input, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in the same column as a 2, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output is 1 and see if they have a common pattern. For example, in the first example's output, the 1s are in positions that are in a certain column range. For example, columns 4-6 in the third row. Maybe the 1s are in positions that are in a certain column range, like columns 4-6, and rows that are between certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape, such as a rectangle. For example, in the first example's output, the 1s form a vertical line in the middle of the grid. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to 2s. For example, in the first example, the 2 is at (0,6) and (0,7). The 1s in the third row are at (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). These positions are not directly adjacent to the 2s. So that might not be the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the pattern is that the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain pattern based on the input's 2s and 3s. But without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3s with 1s in positions that are in a certain region. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in a region that is surrounded by 2s. But again, this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess. Based on the first example, the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region. For example, the third row's 1s are in positions 4-6. The fourth row's 1s are in positions 4-5. The fifth row's 1s are in positions 4-6. This suggests that the 1s form a horizontal line in the middle of the grid. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape, like a cross. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a horizontal line in the third row, and then a vertical line in the fourth row. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region based on the input's 2s. For example, the 2s are at certain positions, and the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain distance from those 2s.\n\nBut without more examples, I need to make an assumption. Let's think about the third example. The input has a 2 in row 0, column 5. The output has 1s in row 2, columns 3-5. So maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are two rows below the 2. But this is just one example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to a 2. For example, in the third example, the 2 is at (0,5), and the 1s are at (2,3-5). But that's not directly adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape, like a rectangle. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a rectangle in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll try to write a function that replaces 3s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in positions that are in a certain column range and row range. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3s with 1s in positions where the input has a 2 in the same column. For example, if there's a 2 in a column, then the 3s in that column are replaced with 1s. But in the first example, the input has 2s in column 6 and 7. In the output, the third row has 1s in column 4-6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain pattern, like a square. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in a square of size 3x3. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm not sure, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern that replaces 3s with 1s in certain positions based on the presence of 2s. For example, if a 2 is present in the input, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? Maybe for each 2 in the input, we replace the 3s in certain positions around it with 1s. For example, in the first example, the 2s are at (0,6) and (0,7). The 1s in the output are in positions that are in the same column as the 2s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region, like a rectangle. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a rectangle that starts from row 2, column 4 to row 6, column 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll try to write a function that replaces 3s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in positions that are in a certain region. But how to determine that region?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3s with 1s in positions where the input has a 2 in the same row or column. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern where the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape, such as a cross or a rectangle. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a horizontal line in the middle of the grid. So perhaps the function replaces 3s with 1s in positions that are in a certain column range.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell in the grid, if the value is 3, replace it with 1 if it is in a certain region. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in positions that are in columns 4-6 and rows 2-6. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region, like a square. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in a square from row 2 to 6 and column 4 to 6.\n\nBut how to implement this? The function would need to check if the cell is in a certain region and replace 3s with 1s. However, this is not a general solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 3s with 1s in positions that are adjacent to 2s. For example, if a cell has a 2 in the input, then the cells adjacent to it are replaced with 1s. But this would require checking the surrounding cells.\n\nBut in the first example, the 2s are at (0,6) and (0,7). The adjacent cells would be (0,5), (0,7), (1,6), etc. But in the output, the 1s are in (2,4), which is not adjacent to the 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the pattern is more complex. Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape based on the input's 2s and 3s. But without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother idea: in the first example's output, the 1s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, the third row's 1s are in positions 4-6, which is three positions. The fourth row has two positions. This suggests that the number of 1s is decreasing as we move down the rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. The first example's output has 1s replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region. The second example has similar patterns. The third example has 1s replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 3s with 1s in positions that are in a certain shape, such as a cross. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a cross in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to implement this? Perhaps the function replaces 3s with 1s in positions where the row and column are within a certain range. For example, rows 2-6 and columns 4-6.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the function replaces 3s with 1s in positions that are in a certain region based on the input's 2s.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 3s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in positions that are in a certain region. But how to determine that region.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain pattern based on the input's 2s. For example, if there's a 2 in the input, then the 1s are placed in a certain pattern around it.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to proceed. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell in the grid, if the value is 3, replace it with 1 if it is in a certain region. For example, rows 2-6 and columns 4-6.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see if this works for the first example.\n\nIn the first example's input, the third row (row 2) has 3s in columns 3-14. The output replaces 3s in columns 4-6 with 1s. So this would fit. Similarly, for other rows.\n\nBut this is just a guess. The code would need to check if the cell is in a certain region and replace 3s with 1s. However, this is not a general solution and may not work for other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain pattern based on the input's 2s. For example, if there's a 2 in the input, then the 1s are placed in a certain pattern around it.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following code: replace 3s with 1s in certain positions based on the presence of 2s in the input. For example, for each 2 in the input, replace the 3s in certain positions around it with 1s.\n\nBut how to implement this? For each 2 in the input, check its surrounding cells and replace 3s with 1s.\n\nBut this is just a guess. For example, in the first example, the 2 is at (0,6) and (0,7). The surrounding cells would be (0,5), (0,7), (1,6), (1,7), (0,6), etc. But in the output, the 1s are in positions that are not directly adjacent to the 2.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to make a different approach. Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain pattern, such as a rectangle. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in a rectangle from row 2 to 6 and column 4 to 6.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the function replaces 3s with 1s in positions where the row is between 2 and 6 and column is between 4 and 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's proceed with this approach.\n\nThe code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(20):\n        for j in range(20):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3 and 2 <= i <= 6 and 4 <= j <= 6:\n                transformed[i][j] = 1\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace 3s with 1s in a certain region. However, this may not work for other examples.\n\nIn the second example, the input has a 2 in row 1, column 14. The output has 1s in certain positions. But this code would not replace those positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the region is different for each example. But this approach is not general.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it may not be correct for all examples. It's the best I can do based on the first example.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the examples provided. Let's look at the first example to see what's going on.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a lot of 2s and 3s, and the output has some 1s and 2s. For instance, the third row of the input has a bunch of 3s, and the output has some 1s and 3s. Looking at the output, there's a transformation where certain positions are replaced with 1s. Maybe the 1s are replacing some of the 2s or 3s in specific regions?\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output, the third row of the input is 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 3 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. So the fifth and sixth elements (indices 4 and 5) in the input are 3s, but in the output they become 1s. Wait, but the output's fifth element is 1, sixth is 1, and seventh is 1. Wait, the original input's third row is 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output third row is 0 0 0 3 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. So the fifth, sixth, seventh elements (indices 4,5,6) are 1s. But in the input, those positions were 3s. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 1s based on some rule.\n\nLooking further, in the input, there's a 2 in the first row, and in the output, that 2 is replaced with 2. But in the output's first row, the seventh and eighth elements are 2 and 2. Wait, the input first row is all 0s except for positions 6 and 7 (assuming 0-based index) which are 2 and 2. The output first row has 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 ... So those 2s remain. So maybe the 2s are preserved, but other numbers are transformed.\n\nLooking at the second example, the input has a 2 in some positions, and the output has 1s in some places. For example, in the second example's input, the third row is 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3. The output for that row is 0 0 3 3 3 1 1 1 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3. So the sixth and seventh elements (indices 5 and 6) in the input are 3s, but in the output they are 1s. So again, replacing 3s with 1s in certain positions.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the first example, the output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to 2s or 3s. For instance, in the first example's input, there's a 2 in the first row, and the output's first row has 2s in the same positions. But in the third row, there's a 2 in the first column (input row 2, column 0?), and in the output, that's 0. Wait, no, looking at the first example's input and output:\n\nInput row 2 (third row) is 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. Output row 2 is 0 0 0 3 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. So the fifth, sixth, seventh elements (indices 4,5,6) are 1s. So maybe those positions are being replaced with 1s because they are adjacent to a 2? Let me check the input. In the input, there's a 2 in row 0, column 6 (assuming 0-based) and row 7, column 0. Wait, looking at the first example's input:\n\nThe input's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So in row 0, column 6 and 7 are 2s. Then in the output, those positions are 2s. But in the third row (input row 2), the 3s are being replaced with 1s in positions 4-6. Maybe there's a pattern where certain regions are being transformed based on proximity to 2s or 3s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in certain regions. For example, in the first example, the output has 1s in positions that are part of a rectangle or some shape. Let me think about the first example's output. The third row has 1s in positions 4-6. The fourth row has 1s in positions 4 and 5 (maybe?), and so on. It seems like there's a pattern where certain areas are being transformed into 1s, possibly based on their position relative to other numbers.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output is 1. For example, in the first example's output, the third row's positions 4-6 are 1s. In the fourth row, positions 4 and 5 are 1s. In the fifth row, positions 4-6 are 1s. In the sixth row, positions 4-6 are 1s. Wait, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in a certain region. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in certain regions that are adjacent to 2s. For instance, in the first example, the input has a 2 in row 0, column 6 and 7. Then, in the third row, the 3s are being replaced with 1s in positions that are adjacent to that 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape. For example, in the first example's output, the third row's 1s are in a horizontal line. Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in certain regions that are part of a larger structure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the first example's output, the 1s seem to be replacing 3s in positions that form a certain pattern. For example, in the third row, the 1s are in positions 4-6. In the fourth row, positions 4 and 5. In the fifth row, positions 4-6. In the sixth row, positions 4-6. Then in the seventh row, positions 4-6 are 1s. Wait, but in the seventh row of the first example's input, the input is 2 0 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 2 0 2 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. So the fourth, fifth, sixth positions (indices 3-5) are 1s. So that's a horizontal line of 1s in positions 3-5. Then in the eighth row, the input is 0 0 0 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 1 2 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. So the fourth position (index 3) is 1, and the sixth (index 5) is 1. So maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to a 2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are replacing 3s in certain positions that are part of a specific pattern. For example, in the first example, the output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to the 2s in the input. For instance, the first 2 is at (0,6) and (0,7). The third row's 1s are in positions (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). Maybe those positions are adjacent to the 2s? Or maybe they are in a certain region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape. For example, in the first example's output, the third row's 1s form a horizontal line, and the fourth row has a 1 in the middle. Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in a certain shape that is determined by the input's 2s.\n\nAnother approach: look at the second example. The input has a 2 in some positions, and the output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the third row of the second example's input, there's a 3 in position 0, then a series of 3s. The output has 3s in the same positions, but some are replaced with 1s. For example, the third row of the input is 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3. The output is 0 0 3 3 3 1 1 1 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3. So the sixth and seventh elements (indices 5 and 6) are 1s. Maybe this is part of a pattern where the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to a 2.\n\nLooking at the second example's input, there's a 2 in row 12, column 0. The output in that row has 1s in certain positions. Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to the 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are part of a certain shape, such as a cross or a rectangle. For example, in the first example, the third row's 1s form a horizontal line. In the fourth row, there's a 1 in the middle. Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are part of a certain shape based on the input's 2s.\n\nAnother idea: the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in positions that are adjacent to the 2s. For instance, the 2 in row 0, column 6 is at (0,6). The third row's 1s are in positions (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). These positions are in a line that's adjacent to the 2 in row 0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region. For example, the 1s form a vertical line in the middle of the grid. But I need to find a consistent pattern.\n\nLooking at the third example's input and output. The input has a 2 in some positions and the output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the third example's input, the third row is 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 3 3 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So the fourth, fifth, sixth elements (indices 3-5) are 1s. The input's third row has 3s in positions 1-3, and the output replaces those with 1s in positions 3-5. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again. The input's third row is 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 3 3 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So the fourth, fifth, sixth elements (indices 3,4,5) are 1s. The original input's third row has 3s in positions 1-4. But the output's third row has 1s in positions 3-5. So maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to a 2?\n\nIn the third example's input, there's a 2 in row 0, column 5. The output's third row has 1s in positions 3-5. So maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to the 2.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is that whenever there's a 2 in the input, certain positions around it are replaced with 1s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region, like a square or a rectangle. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a horizontal line in the third row. But that's not consistent across all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape determined by the input's 2s. For example, in the first example, the 2 is at (0,6) and (0,7). The 1s in the third row are in positions (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). These positions are directly below the 2s? But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output is 1. For example, in the first example's output, the third row's 1s are in positions (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). The fourth row has (3,4), (3,5). The fifth row has (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). The sixth row has (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). The seventh row has (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). The eighth row has (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). The ninth row has (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). The tenth row has (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). The eleventh row has (10,3), (10,4), (10,5). The twelfth row has (11,3), (11,4), (11,5). The thirteenth row has (12,3), (12,4), (12,5). The fourteenth row has (13,3), (13,4), (13,5). The fifteenth row has (14,3), (14,4), (14,5). The sixteenth row has (15,3), (15,4), (15,5). The seventeenth row has (16,3), (16,4), (16,5). The eighteenth row has (17,3), (17,4), (17,5). The nineteenth row has (18,3), (18,4), (18,5). The twentieth row has (19,3), (19,4), (19,5). \n\nWait, this seems like a vertical line of 1s in the middle of the grid. But that can't be right. Wait, looking at the first example's output, the third row has 1s in positions 4-6, which are columns 4,5,6. Then in the fourth row, positions 4 and 5. Wait, maybe the 1s are in a certain pattern that forms a rectangle or a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are part of a certain shape based on the input's 2s. For example, the 2s in the input are at certain positions, and the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to those 2s. \n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region around the 2s. For example, in the first example, the 2s are in the first row, and the 1s are in the third row, which is two rows below. But that's not a clear pattern.\n\nAnother idea: the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a horizontal line in the third row, then a vertical line in the fourth row, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first example's output, the third row has 1s in positions 4-6, which are part of a horizontal line. The fourth row has 1s in positions 4 and 5. The fifth row has 1s in 4-6. This seems like a horizontal line that's expanding. Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are part of a certain shape determined by the input's 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape, like a rectangle. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a rectangle in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. Since the output has 1s replacing 3s in certain positions, perhaps the transformation is to replace 3s with 1s in certain regions. But what regions?\n\nLooking at the first example's input, the 3s are in certain positions. The output replaces some of them with 1s. For example, in the third row of the input, there's a 3 in position 3, and in the output, it's 3. But in position 4, it's 1. So maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to a 2. For example, the 2 in row 0, column 6 is adjacent to the 3 in row 1, column 6. But in the output, the 3 in row 2, column 4 is replaced with 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape. For example, in the first example's output, the 1s form a vertical line in the middle of the grid. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain pattern based on the input's 2s. For example, the 2s in the input are at certain positions, and the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain distance from those 2s.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's look at the third example. The input has a 2 in row 0, column 5. The output has 1s in row 2, columns 3-5. So maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are two rows below the 2. But that's just one example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape. For example, in the third example, the 1s form a horizontal line in the middle of the row. So maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain pattern based on the input's 2s.\n\nAnother idea: the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape, such as a cross or a square. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a horizontal line in the third row, but that's just one part of a larger pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are part of a certain region. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in a vertical line that starts from the third row and goes down. But how?\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as replacing certain positions with 1s based on the presence of 2s in the input. For example, if a 2 is present in the input, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in the same column as a 2, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output is 1 and see if they have a common pattern. For example, in the first example's output, the 1s are in positions that are in a certain column range. For example, columns 4-6 in the third row. Maybe the 1s are in positions that are in a certain column range, like columns 4-6, and rows that are between certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape, such as a rectangle. For example, in the first example's output, the 1s form a vertical line in the middle of the grid. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to 2s. For example, in the first example, the 2 is at (0,6) and (0,7). The 1s in the third row are at (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). These positions are not directly adjacent to the 2s. So that might not be the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the pattern is that the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain pattern based on the input's 2s and 3s. But without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3s with 1s in positions that are in a certain region. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in a region that is surrounded by 2s. But again, this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess. Based on the first example, the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region. For example, the third row's 1s are in positions 4-6. The fourth row's 1s are in positions 4-5. The fifth row's 1s are in positions 4-6. This suggests that the 1s form a horizontal line in the middle of the grid. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape, like a cross. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a horizontal line in the third row, and then a vertical line in the fourth row. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region based on the input's 2s. For example, the 2s are at certain positions, and the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain distance from those 2s.\n\nBut without more examples, I need to make an assumption. Let's think about the third example. The input has a 2 in row 0, column 5. The output has 1s in row 2, columns 3-5. So maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are two rows below the 2. But this is just one example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are adjacent to a 2. For example, in the third example, the 2 is at (0,5), and the 1s are at (2,3-5). But that's not directly adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape, like a rectangle. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a rectangle in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll try to write a function that replaces 3s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in positions that are in a certain column range and row range. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3s with 1s in positions where the input has a 2 in the same column. For example, if there's a 2 in a column, then the 3s in that column are replaced with 1s. But in the first example, the input has 2s in column 6 and 7. In the output, the third row has 1s in column 4-6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain pattern, like a square. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in a square of size 3x3. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm not sure, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern that replaces 3s with 1s in certain positions based on the presence of 2s. For example, if a 2 is present in the input, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? Maybe for each 2 in the input, we replace the 3s in certain positions around it with 1s. For example, in the first example, the 2s are at (0,6) and (0,7). The 1s in the output are in positions that are in the same column as the 2s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region, like a rectangle. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a rectangle that starts from row 2, column 4 to row 6, column 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll try to write a function that replaces 3s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in positions that are in a certain region. But how to determine that region?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3s with 1s in positions where the input has a 2 in the same row or column. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern where the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape, such as a cross or a rectangle. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a horizontal line in the middle of the grid. So perhaps the function replaces 3s with 1s in positions that are in a certain column range.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell in the grid, if the value is 3, replace it with 1 if it is in a certain region. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in positions that are in columns 4-6 and rows 2-6. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region, like a square. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in a square from row 2 to 6 and column 4 to 6.\n\nBut how to implement this? The function would need to check if the cell is in a certain region and replace 3s with 1s. However, this is not a general solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 3s with 1s in positions that are adjacent to 2s. For example, if a cell has a 2 in the input, then the cells adjacent to it are replaced with 1s. But this would require checking the surrounding cells.\n\nBut in the first example, the 2s are at (0,6) and (0,7). The adjacent cells would be (0,5), (0,7), (1,6), etc. But in the output, the 1s are in (2,4), which is not adjacent to the 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the pattern is more complex. Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain shape based on the input's 2s and 3s. But without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother idea: in the first example's output, the 1s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, the third row's 1s are in positions 4-6, which is three positions. The fourth row has two positions. This suggests that the number of 1s is decreasing as we move down the rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. The first example's output has 1s replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region. The second example has similar patterns. The third example has 1s replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain region.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 3s with 1s in positions that are in a certain shape, such as a cross. For example, in the first example, the 1s form a cross in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to implement this? Perhaps the function replaces 3s with 1s in positions where the row and column are within a certain range. For example, rows 2-6 and columns 4-6.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the function replaces 3s with 1s in positions that are in a certain region based on the input's 2s.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 3s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in positions that are in a certain region. But how to determine that region.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain pattern based on the input's 2s. For example, if there's a 2 in the input, then the 1s are placed in a certain pattern around it.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to proceed. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell in the grid, if the value is 3, replace it with 1 if it is in a certain region. For example, rows 2-6 and columns 4-6.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see if this works for the first example.\n\nIn the first example's input, the third row (row 2) has 3s in columns 3-14. The output replaces 3s in columns 4-6 with 1s. So this would fit. Similarly, for other rows.\n\nBut this is just a guess. The code would need to check if the cell is in a certain region and replace 3s with 1s. However, this is not a general solution and may not work for other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain pattern based on the input's 2s. For example, if there's a 2 in the input, then the 1s are placed in a certain pattern around it.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following code: replace 3s with 1s in certain positions based on the presence of 2s in the input. For example, for each 2 in the input, replace the 3s in certain positions around it with 1s.\n\nBut how to implement this? For each 2 in the input, check its surrounding cells and replace 3s with 1s.\n\nBut this is just a guess. For example, in the first example, the 2 is at (0,6) and (0,7). The surrounding cells would be (0,5), (0,7), (1,6), (1,7), (0,6), etc. But in the output, the 1s are in positions that are not directly adjacent to the 2.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to make a different approach. Maybe the 1s are replacing 3s in positions that are in a certain pattern, such as a rectangle. For example, in the first example, the 1s are in a rectangle from row 2 to 6 and column 4 to 6.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the function replaces 3s with 1s in positions where the row is between 2 and 6 and column is between 4 and 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's proceed with this approach.\n\nThe code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(20):\n        for j in range(20):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3 and 2 <= i <= 6 and 4 <= j <= 6:\n                transformed[i][j] = 1\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace 3s with 1s in a certain region. However, this may not work for other examples.\n\nIn the second example, the input has a 2 in row 1, column 14. The output has 1s in certain positions. But this code would not replace those positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the region is different for each example. But this approach is not general.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it may not be correct for all examples. It's the best I can do based on the first example.\n"
