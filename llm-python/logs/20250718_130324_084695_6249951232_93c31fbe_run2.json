          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that maps the input grids to the output grids in the training examples. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input and output grids are both 23x25. Let's see what changes. For instance, in the first example, the input has some 2s and 1s in certain positions, and the output has some changes. Looking at the first few rows of input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0s except for 2s in positions 2 and 3, then 2s again in positions 14 and 15. Output row 1 has 2s in positions 2 and 3, then 2s in 14 and 15. Wait, but the output row 1 is same as input row 1? Wait no, the output row 1 in example 1 is same as input row 1? Wait the input for example 1's first row is all 0s. The output first row is also all 0s. So maybe that's not helpful. Let me check another row.\n\nLooking at input row 2 of example 1: it has 0s except for 2s in positions 2-3 and 14-15. The output row 2 has 2s in positions 2-3 and 14-15. So same as input? Wait but the output row 2 in example 1 is the same as input row 2? Wait the output for example 1's row 2 is 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Which is same as input row 2. Wait but in the output, the third row of example 1 has 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So in input row 3, the original is 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output row 3 has 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So in the output, the 11th and 12th columns (positions 10 and 11 if zero-based?) are 1s. Wait the input row 3 has 0s in those positions, but output has 1s. Hmm. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed based on some rules.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the third row has 1s in positions 10 and 11 (assuming zero-based). But where are those positions in the input? The input row 3 has 0s there. So maybe there's a transformation that replaces certain values with others based on their positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping certain patterns. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have some 1s where the input had 0s. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2. The input has some 8s and 0s. The output has some 8s and 1s. For example, in the input row 2, there are 8s in positions 2-3 and 18-19. The output row 2 has 8s in the same positions. But in other rows, like row 3, the input has 8s and 0s, and the output has 8s and 1s. Wait, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their positions. For example, in example 2, the output seems to have 1s where the input had 0s in certain positions. But how to find the pattern?\n\nLooking at example 3. The input has 3s and 1s. The output has 3s and 1s, but some positions are changed. For instance, in input row 3, there are 3s in positions 3-4 and 9-10. The output has 3s in the same positions. But in other rows, like row 7, the input has a 1 in position 7, and the output has 1 in position 7. But in row 8 of input, there's a 1 in position 7, and the output has 1 in position 7. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s where the input had 0s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain patterns. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s where the input had 0s in certain positions. For instance, in row 3 of example 1, the input has 0s in positions 10 and 11, but the output has 1s there. But how to determine the pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. But how to find those positions?\n\nLooking at example 1's output row 3: the 1s are in positions 10 and 11 (assuming zero-based). Let me check the input row 3 of example 1. The input row 3 is:\n\n0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the input, positions 6 and 7 (0-based) are 1s. The output row 3 has 1s in positions 6 and 7, but also in positions 10 and 11. Wait, no. The output row 3 is:\n\n0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo positions 10 and 11 (indices 10 and 11) are 1s. But in the input row 3, those positions were 0s. So maybe the transformation is adding 1s in certain positions where there are 0s. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking for a pattern in example 1's output. For instance, in the output, the 1s seem to be in positions that are adjacent to 2s or other numbers. For example, in row 3 of example 1, the 1s are in positions 10 and 11, which are adjacent to the 2s in the input. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values based on their positions. For example, if a cell is 0 and is in a certain row or column, then it's replaced with 1. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. In example 2, the input has some 8s and 0s. The output has 8s and 1s. For instance, in the input row 3, there's a 8 in position 3, and the output has 8 in the same position. But in other positions, like position 7, the input has 0 and the output has 1. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced with 1s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions that are part of a specific pattern. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in positions where the input had 0s, but only in certain areas. But how to find those areas?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping certain bits. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s where the input had 0s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at the test input. The test input has 0s and 4s and 1s. The output is not given, but the task is to write the transformation. However, the test input is just for context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their coordinates. For example, if the row and column indices satisfy some condition, then 0 is replaced with 1. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in positions (row, column) where (row + column) is even or some other condition.\n\nBut how to find that? Let's look at example 1's output row 3. The 1s are at positions 10 and 11. Let's say the row is 2 (since the first row is 0, second is 1, etc.)? Wait, in example 1, the input and output are 23 rows. So row indices are 0 to 22.\n\nIn the output row 3 (row index 2?), the positions 10 and 11 are 1s. Let me check the input row 2 (row index 2) of example 1. The input row 2 is:\n\n0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in row index 2, the 1s are at positions 6 and 7. The output row 2 is:\n\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWhich is same as input. So no change here. But in row index 3 of example 1's output, the 1s are at positions 10 and 11. Let's see the input row 3 (row index 3) of example 1:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0\n\nSo in the input, positions 5 and 6 are 1s. The output row 3 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0\n\nSo in the output, positions 10 and 11 (indices 10 and 11) are 1s. So in the input, those positions were 0s. So the transformation added 1s there. But why those positions?\n\nLooking for a pattern in the positions. For example, in the output row 3, the 1s are at positions 10 and 11. Let's see the input row 3. The input row 3 has 1s at positions 5 and 6. The output has 1s at positions 10 and 11. So maybe the transformation is to mirror or shift the positions? Or maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled based on the presence of other values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on the presence of 2s. For example, in the input, if there's a 2 in a certain position, then the surrounding cells are changed to 1s. But this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the third row has 1s in positions 10 and 11. The input row 3 has 0s there. But in the input row 3, there are 2s in positions 18 and 19. Maybe those 2s are causing the 1s in positions 10 and 11. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions that are part of a specific pattern. For example, in the output, there are 1s in positions that are part of a cross shape or something. But without seeing more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: look for common transformations between input and output. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have 1s where the input had 0s, but only in certain areas. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain rows and columns. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in positions where the row is even and column is even? Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain regions. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. But this is too vague.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input has 8s and 0s. The output has 8s and 1s. For example, in input row 3, there are 8s in positions 3 and 4, and the output has 8s in those positions. But in other positions, like position 7, the input has 0 and the output has 1. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their proximity to 8s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain rows or columns. For example, in example 2's output, the 1s are in rows where the input had 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row or column as certain values. For example, if a cell is in the same row as a 2, then it's replaced with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output in example 1. For instance, in the output, some 0s are turned into 1s. For example, in row 3 of example 1, the output has 1s in positions 10 and 11, which were 0s in the input. But why those positions?\n\nLooking at the input row 3, the 1s are in positions 5 and 6. The output has 1s in positions 10 and 11. Maybe there's a pattern where the 1s are mirrored or shifted. For example, if the input has a 1 in position (i,j), then the output has a 1 in position (i, j + 5) or something. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain regions of the grid. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in the middle of the grid. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the third row has 1s in positions 10 and 11. The input row 3 has 0s there. But in the input, there are 2s in positions 18 and 19. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are adjacent to 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are part of a certain pattern, such as a cross or a line. For example, in the output of example 1, the 1s are in positions that form a line or cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on the value of the cell in the input. For example, if the cell is 0 and its neighbors are 2s, then it becomes 1. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain rows and columns. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are in rows where the row number is even and columns where the column number is even. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain positions relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is in the same row as a 2, then it becomes 1. But how to verify this.\n\nLooking at example 1's output row 3, the 1s are in positions 10 and 11. In the input row 3, there are 2s in positions 18 and 19. So maybe the 1s are in positions that are in the same row as the 2s. But in this case, the 2s are in positions 18 and 19, and the 1s are in positions 10 and 11, which are earlier in the row. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same column as certain values. For example, if a column has a 2, then the 0s in that column are replaced with 1s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain patterns, such as diagonals. For example, positions where the row and column indices add up to a certain value.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find a pattern. Let's look at example 3. The input has 3s and 1s. The output has 3s and 1s. For example, in the input row 3, there are 3s in positions 3 and 4, and the output has 3s there. In the output row 7, there are 1s in positions 7 and 8. But in the input row 7, there's a 1 in position 7. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain regions. For example, in the middle of the grid. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a certain value. For example, if the row contains a 2, then the 0s in that row are replaced with 1s. But in example 1's row 2, there are 2s, and the output row 2 is same as input. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the third row has 1s in positions 10 and 11. The input row 3 has 0s there. But in the input row 3, there are 2s in positions 18 and 19. Maybe the 1s are in positions that are 8 columns away from the 2s. For example, 18-8=10. So that's possible. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns away from 2s.\n\nBut how to verify this. Let's check another position. In example 1's output row 3, the 1s are at 10 and 11. If the 2s are at 18 and 19, then 18-8=10, which matches. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's check another example. In example 1's output row 3, the 1s are at 10 and 11. The 2s are at 18 and 19. So 18-8=10, 19-8=11. So that fits. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2.\n\nBut how to generalize this. For example, if there's a 2 in column c, then positions c-8 and c-7 are replaced with 1s. But this would only work if c-8 is >=0.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on one example. Let's see if this holds for other examples.\n\nIn example 1's output row 3, the 1s are at 10 and 11. The 2s are at 18 and 19. So 18-8=10, 19-8=11. So that fits. Now, looking at example 1's output row 4. The input row 4 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0\n\nThe output row 4 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0\n\nSo the 1s are at positions 10 and 11 (indices 10 and 11). The input row 4 has 2s at positions 18 and 19. So again, 18-8=10, 19-8=11. So this fits. So this suggests that the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2.\n\nBut why 8? Because in example 1, the 2s are at column 18 and 19, and the 1s are at 10 and 11. 18-8=10, 19-8=11. So 8 is the distance. But what if there are other values?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2. But how to handle other values.\n\nBut this is just based on example 1. Let's check example 2.\n\nIn example 2's input, there are 8s. Let's see if the output has 1s in positions 8 columns to the left of an 8.\n\nFor example, in example 2's input row 3:\n\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0\n\nThe output row 3 is:\n\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0\n\nSo no changes. But in other rows, like row 4 of example 2:\n\nInput row 4:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 4:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 1 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the input row 4, there is a 1 at position 5 (0-based). The output has a 1 at position 7. So maybe this is not related to 8s. But according to the earlier hypothesis, it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2 in example 1, and similar for other numbers. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2, and for other values, like 8, replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of an 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this in code. For each cell in the input grid, if the cell is 0, check if there is a 2 in the same row, and if the column is 8 positions to the right, then replace with 1. But this would require checking for each 0 cell, whether there is a 2 in the same row, at column c, then set the cell at column c-8 to 1.\n\nBut this is a possible approach. Let's see if this works for example 1.\n\nIn example 1's input row 3, there is a 2 at column 2 (assuming zero-based?), no. Wait in the input row 3 of example 1, the input is:\n\n0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 2s are at column 2 and column 15 (assuming zero-based). Wait, the input row 3 has 2 at column 2, and then another 2 at column 15 (position 15). So for the 2 at column 2, the cell at column 2-8 = -6, which is invalid. For the 2 at column 15, 15-8=7. So column 7. But in the input row 3, column 7 is 1. So this would not change anything. But in the output row 3, there are 1s at columns 10 and 11. So this hypothesis is not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain positions relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is 0 and is in the same row as a 2, then it becomes 1. But this would not explain the example 1's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain patterns, such as a diagonal line.\n\nBut this is too vague. Another approach: look for the difference between input and output in example 1.\n\nIn example 1's output, the third row has 1s at positions 10 and 11. In the input, those positions are 0. The input row 3 has 2s at positions 2 and 15. Maybe the 1s are added in positions that are 8 columns away from the 2s. For example, 2+8=10, 15-8=7. But that doesn't fit. Or maybe the 1s are added in positions that are 8 columns to the left of the 2s. For example, 2-8 = -6, which is invalid. 15-8=7. But in the output, there are 1s at 10 and 11, which are not 7.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAnother idea: look for the transformation as a combination of operations. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in certain positions, which might be the result of some kind of pattern that is not directly based on the input values but on their positions.\n\nFor example, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row and column indices satisfy certain conditions. For example, if (row + column) is even, then replace 0 with 1. But in example 1, the output row 3 has 1s at positions 10 and 11. For row 3 (assuming row index 2), column 10: 2+10=12 (even). Column 11: 2+11=13 (odd). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where (row - column) is even. For example, row 3 (index 2), column 10: 2-10 = -8 (even). Column 11: 2-11 = -9 (odd). So only column 10 would be replaced. But the output has both 10 and 11 as 1s, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s form a line or a cross.\n\nBut without seeing more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain rows and columns. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are in rows 2 and 3, and columns 10-11. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain regions of the grid. For example, the middle part of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine which regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2, and in the same column as a 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the test input. The test input has 0s, 4s, and 1s. The output is not given, but the transformation should be applied to it. However, since I don't have the output, I need to rely on the training examples.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their coordinates. For example, if the row is even and the column is even, replace 0 with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are part of certain patterns. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are part of a diagonal line from the 2s.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2, and in the same column as a 2. For example, if a cell is 0 and is in the same row or column as a 2, then it becomes 1. But in example 1, the output row 2 has 2s, and the output is the same as input. So this would not change anything.\n\nBut in example 1's output row 3, there are 1s in positions 10 and 11. In the input row 3, there are 2s in positions 2 and 15. So if the 1s are in positions that are in the same row as 2s, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain rows and columns. For example, in example 1, the 1s are in rows 2 and 3, columns 10-11. But how to generalize.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern that is common across all examples. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in certain positions, and in example 2, the output has 1s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2 or 8, and in the same column as a 2 or 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain rows or columns. For example, rows 2, 3, 4, etc., and columns 10, 11, etc.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain patterns, like a cross. For example, in example 1, the 1s are in positions that form a cross.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2 and in the same column as a 2.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, maybe I should consider that the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their coordinates. For example, if the row is even, replace 0s with 1s in certain columns.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row and column indices are both even. For example, in example 1's output row 3, the 1s are at column 10 and 11. If row is 2 (even), column 10 is even, column 11 is odd. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row is even and the column is even. But this would not explain the example 1's output.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain regions of the grid, such as the middle part. For example, in example 1, the 1s are in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine which regions.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2 and in the same column as a 2. For example, if there is a 2 in row i, column j, then the cell at (i, j) is 2, and the cell at (i, j-8) is 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain patterns, like a diagonal line. For example, in example 1, the 1s are in positions that form a diagonal.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the examples I can see. For example, in example 1, the 1s are added in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2. Let's try to implement this.\n\nSo, for each cell in the grid, if the cell is 0, check if there is a 2 in the same row, and if the column is 8 positions to the right of this cell. If so, replace with 1.\n\nBut how to implement this. For each row, for each cell, if it is 0, check if there is a 2 in the same row, at column c = current column + 8. If yes, then replace with 1.\n\nBut this would only work for cells where the column +8 is within the grid.\n\nLet's test this on example 1's row 3. The input row 3 has 2 at column 2. So for column 2-8 = -6, which is invalid. But there is a 2 at column 15. For column 15-8=7. So if the current cell is 0 at column 7, it would be replaced with 1. But in the input row 3, column 7 is 1, so no change. But in the output, there are 1s at columns 10 and 11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this approach doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2, but only if the 2 is in the same row. For example, in example 1's row 3, there is a 2 at column 15. So 15-8=7, so column 7 would be replaced with 1. But in the input row 3, column 7 is 1, so no change. But in the output, there are 1s at columns 10 and 11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2, and 8 columns to the right of a 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2 or 8 columns to the right of a 2.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should consider that the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row and column indices are both even. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain rows or columns. For example, rows 2-4 and columns 10-12.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in the middle part of the grid. But how to determine the middle part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2 or 8, and in the same column as a 2 or 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2 or 8, and in the same column as a 2 or 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code would iterate through each cell. If the cell is 0, check if there is a 2 or 8 in the same row or column. If so, replace with 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to implement this.\n\nHowever, this might not work for all examples. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nBut how to implement this. For each cell (i, j), if grid[i][j] is 0, then check if there is any 2 or 8 in the same row or column. If yes, replace with 1.\n\nBut this would replace too many cells. For example, in example 1's input row 2, there are 2s, so all 0s in that row would be replaced with 1s. But in the output, the row is the same as input, so this is not correct.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2 and in the same column as a 2. For example, if there is a 2 in (i, j), then the cell at (i, j) is 2, and the cell at (i, j-8) is 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2. So the code would look for 2s in the input, and for each 2, replace the cell 8 columns to the left with 1 if it's 0.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- Iterate over each cell in the input grid.\n- For each cell, if it is a 2, check if there is a cell 8 columns to the left (i.e., column -8). If that cell is 0, replace it with 1.\n- Similarly, for 8s in example 2, replace 0s 8 columns to the left with 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to implement this.\n\nSo, for each row in the input grid:\n\nfor i in range(23):\n    for j in range(25):\n        if grid[i][j] == 2:\n            if j - 8 >= 0:\n                if grid[i][j-8] == 0:\n                    new_grid[i][j-8] = 1\n\nBut this would only handle 2s. For example, in example 1, the 2s are at column 2 and 15. For column 2, j-8 = -6 (invalid). For column 15, j-8=7. So the cell at column 7 would be replaced with 1. But in the input row 3, column 7 is 1, so no change. But in the output, there are 1s at columns 10 and 11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe this is part of the transformation. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of 2s and 8 columns to the right of 2s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2 or 8 columns to the right of a 2.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2. This is based on example 1's output.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = [[0]*25 for _ in range(23)]\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(25):\n            new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                if j - 8 >= 0:\n                    new_grid[i][j-8] = 1\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this would replace 0s with 1s in positions 8 columns to the left of 2s. But this may not work for all examples. For example, in example 1's row 3, the 2 is at column 15, so j-8=7. So new_grid[i][7] is set to 1. But in the input row 3, column 7 is 1, so no change. But in the output, there are 1s at columns 10 and 11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps this is part of the transformation, and there are other patterns. For example, in example 1, there are other 2s in the grid that may contribute to other 1s.\n\nBut this is just a guess. I'll proceed with this code and see if it passes the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nHowever, this code may not work for the examples, but it's the best I can do based on the given information.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that maps the input grids to the output grids in the training examples. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input and output grids are both 23x25. Let's see what changes. For instance, in the first example, the input has some 2s and 1s in certain positions, and the output has some changes. Looking at the first few rows of input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0s except for 2s in positions 2 and 3, then 2s again in positions 14 and 15. Output row 1 has 2s in positions 2 and 3, then 2s in 14 and 15. Wait, but the output row 1 is same as input row 1? Wait no, the output row 1 in example 1 is same as input row 1? Wait the input for example 1's first row is all 0s. The output first row is also all 0s. So maybe that's not helpful. Let me check another row.\n\nLooking at input row 2 of example 1: it has 0s except for 2s in positions 2-3 and 14-15. The output row 2 has 2s in positions 2-3 and 14-15. So same as input? Wait but the output row 2 in example 1 is the same as input row 2? Wait the output for example 1's row 2 is 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Which is same as input row 2. Wait but in the output, the third row of example 1 has 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So in input row 3, the original is 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output row 3 has 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So in the output, the 11th and 12th columns (positions 10 and 11 if zero-based?) are 1s. Wait the input row 3 has 0s in those positions, but output has 1s. Hmm. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed based on some rules.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the third row has 1s in positions 10 and 11 (assuming zero-based). But where are those positions in the input? The input row 3 has 0s there. So maybe there's a transformation that replaces certain values with others based on their positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping certain patterns. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have some 1s where the input had 0s. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2. The input has some 8s and 0s. The output has some 8s and 1s. For example, in the input row 2, there are 8s in positions 2-3 and 18-19. The output row 2 has 8s in the same positions. But in other rows, like row 3, the input has 8s and 0s, and the output has 8s and 1s. Wait, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their positions. For example, in example 2, the output seems to have 1s where the input had 0s in certain positions. But how to find the pattern?\n\nLooking at example 3. The input has 3s and 1s. The output has 3s and 1s, but some positions are changed. For instance, in input row 3, there are 3s in positions 3-4 and 9-10. The output has 3s in the same positions. But in other rows, like row 7, the input has a 1 in position 7, and the output has 1 in position 7. But in row 8 of input, there's a 1 in position 7, and the output has 1 in position 7. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s where the input had 0s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain patterns. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s where the input had 0s in certain positions. For instance, in row 3 of example 1, the input has 0s in positions 10 and 11, but the output has 1s there. But how to determine the pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. But how to find those positions?\n\nLooking at example 1's output row 3: the 1s are in positions 10 and 11 (assuming zero-based). Let me check the input row 3 of example 1. The input row 3 is:\n\n0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the input, positions 6 and 7 (0-based) are 1s. The output row 3 has 1s in positions 6 and 7, but also in positions 10 and 11. Wait, no. The output row 3 is:\n\n0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo positions 10 and 11 (indices 10 and 11) are 1s. But in the input row 3, those positions were 0s. So maybe the transformation is adding 1s in certain positions where there are 0s. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking for a pattern in example 1's output. For instance, in the output, the 1s seem to be in positions that are adjacent to 2s or other numbers. For example, in row 3 of example 1, the 1s are in positions 10 and 11, which are adjacent to the 2s in the input. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values based on their positions. For example, if a cell is 0 and is in a certain row or column, then it's replaced with 1. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. In example 2, the input has some 8s and 0s. The output has 8s and 1s. For instance, in the input row 3, there's a 8 in position 3, and the output has 8 in the same position. But in other positions, like position 7, the input has 0 and the output has 1. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced with 1s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions that are part of a specific pattern. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in positions where the input had 0s, but only in certain areas. But how to find those areas?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping certain bits. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s where the input had 0s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at the test input. The test input has 0s and 4s and 1s. The output is not given, but the task is to write the transformation. However, the test input is just for context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their coordinates. For example, if the row and column indices satisfy some condition, then 0 is replaced with 1. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in positions (row, column) where (row + column) is even or some other condition.\n\nBut how to find that? Let's look at example 1's output row 3. The 1s are at positions 10 and 11. Let's say the row is 2 (since the first row is 0, second is 1, etc.)? Wait, in example 1, the input and output are 23 rows. So row indices are 0 to 22.\n\nIn the output row 3 (row index 2?), the positions 10 and 11 are 1s. Let me check the input row 2 (row index 2) of example 1. The input row 2 is:\n\n0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in row index 2, the 1s are at positions 6 and 7. The output row 2 is:\n\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWhich is same as input. So no change here. But in row index 3 of example 1's output, the 1s are at positions 10 and 11. Let's see the input row 3 (row index 3) of example 1:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0\n\nSo in the input, positions 5 and 6 are 1s. The output row 3 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0\n\nSo in the output, positions 10 and 11 (indices 10 and 11) are 1s. So in the input, those positions were 0s. So the transformation added 1s there. But why those positions?\n\nLooking for a pattern in the positions. For example, in the output row 3, the 1s are at positions 10 and 11. Let's see the input row 3. The input row 3 has 1s at positions 5 and 6. The output has 1s at positions 10 and 11. So maybe the transformation is to mirror or shift the positions? Or maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled based on the presence of other values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on the presence of 2s. For example, in the input, if there's a 2 in a certain position, then the surrounding cells are changed to 1s. But this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the third row has 1s in positions 10 and 11. The input row 3 has 0s there. But in the input row 3, there are 2s in positions 18 and 19. Maybe those 2s are causing the 1s in positions 10 and 11. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions that are part of a specific pattern. For example, in the output, there are 1s in positions that are part of a cross shape or something. But without seeing more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: look for common transformations between input and output. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have 1s where the input had 0s, but only in certain areas. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain rows and columns. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in positions where the row is even and column is even? Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain regions. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. But this is too vague.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input has 8s and 0s. The output has 8s and 1s. For example, in input row 3, there are 8s in positions 3 and 4, and the output has 8s in those positions. But in other positions, like position 7, the input has 0 and the output has 1. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their proximity to 8s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain rows or columns. For example, in example 2's output, the 1s are in rows where the input had 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row or column as certain values. For example, if a cell is in the same row as a 2, then it's replaced with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output in example 1. For instance, in the output, some 0s are turned into 1s. For example, in row 3 of example 1, the output has 1s in positions 10 and 11, which were 0s in the input. But why those positions?\n\nLooking at the input row 3, the 1s are in positions 5 and 6. The output has 1s in positions 10 and 11. Maybe there's a pattern where the 1s are mirrored or shifted. For example, if the input has a 1 in position (i,j), then the output has a 1 in position (i, j + 5) or something. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain regions of the grid. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in the middle of the grid. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the third row has 1s in positions 10 and 11. The input row 3 has 0s there. But in the input, there are 2s in positions 18 and 19. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are adjacent to 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are part of a certain pattern, such as a cross or a line. For example, in the output of example 1, the 1s are in positions that form a line or cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on the value of the cell in the input. For example, if the cell is 0 and its neighbors are 2s, then it becomes 1. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain rows and columns. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are in rows where the row number is even and columns where the column number is even. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain positions relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is in the same row as a 2, then it becomes 1. But how to verify this.\n\nLooking at example 1's output row 3, the 1s are in positions 10 and 11. In the input row 3, there are 2s in positions 18 and 19. So maybe the 1s are in positions that are in the same row as the 2s. But in this case, the 2s are in positions 18 and 19, and the 1s are in positions 10 and 11, which are earlier in the row. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same column as certain values. For example, if a column has a 2, then the 0s in that column are replaced with 1s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain patterns, such as diagonals. For example, positions where the row and column indices add up to a certain value.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find a pattern. Let's look at example 3. The input has 3s and 1s. The output has 3s and 1s. For example, in the input row 3, there are 3s in positions 3 and 4, and the output has 3s there. In the output row 7, there are 1s in positions 7 and 8. But in the input row 7, there's a 1 in position 7. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain regions. For example, in the middle of the grid. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a certain value. For example, if the row contains a 2, then the 0s in that row are replaced with 1s. But in example 1's row 2, there are 2s, and the output row 2 is same as input. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the third row has 1s in positions 10 and 11. The input row 3 has 0s there. But in the input row 3, there are 2s in positions 18 and 19. Maybe the 1s are in positions that are 8 columns away from the 2s. For example, 18-8=10. So that's possible. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns away from 2s.\n\nBut how to verify this. Let's check another position. In example 1's output row 3, the 1s are at 10 and 11. If the 2s are at 18 and 19, then 18-8=10, which matches. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's check another example. In example 1's output row 3, the 1s are at 10 and 11. The 2s are at 18 and 19. So 18-8=10, 19-8=11. So that fits. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2.\n\nBut how to generalize this. For example, if there's a 2 in column c, then positions c-8 and c-7 are replaced with 1s. But this would only work if c-8 is >=0.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on one example. Let's see if this holds for other examples.\n\nIn example 1's output row 3, the 1s are at 10 and 11. The 2s are at 18 and 19. So 18-8=10, 19-8=11. So that fits. Now, looking at example 1's output row 4. The input row 4 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0\n\nThe output row 4 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0\n\nSo the 1s are at positions 10 and 11 (indices 10 and 11). The input row 4 has 2s at positions 18 and 19. So again, 18-8=10, 19-8=11. So this fits. So this suggests that the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2.\n\nBut why 8? Because in example 1, the 2s are at column 18 and 19, and the 1s are at 10 and 11. 18-8=10, 19-8=11. So 8 is the distance. But what if there are other values?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2. But how to handle other values.\n\nBut this is just based on example 1. Let's check example 2.\n\nIn example 2's input, there are 8s. Let's see if the output has 1s in positions 8 columns to the left of an 8.\n\nFor example, in example 2's input row 3:\n\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0\n\nThe output row 3 is:\n\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0\n\nSo no changes. But in other rows, like row 4 of example 2:\n\nInput row 4:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 4:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 1 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the input row 4, there is a 1 at position 5 (0-based). The output has a 1 at position 7. So maybe this is not related to 8s. But according to the earlier hypothesis, it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2 in example 1, and similar for other numbers. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2, and for other values, like 8, replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of an 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this in code. For each cell in the input grid, if the cell is 0, check if there is a 2 in the same row, and if the column is 8 positions to the right, then replace with 1. But this would require checking for each 0 cell, whether there is a 2 in the same row, at column c, then set the cell at column c-8 to 1.\n\nBut this is a possible approach. Let's see if this works for example 1.\n\nIn example 1's input row 3, there is a 2 at column 2 (assuming zero-based?), no. Wait in the input row 3 of example 1, the input is:\n\n0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 2s are at column 2 and column 15 (assuming zero-based). Wait, the input row 3 has 2 at column 2, and then another 2 at column 15 (position 15). So for the 2 at column 2, the cell at column 2-8 = -6, which is invalid. For the 2 at column 15, 15-8=7. So column 7. But in the input row 3, column 7 is 1. So this would not change anything. But in the output row 3, there are 1s at columns 10 and 11. So this hypothesis is not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain positions relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is 0 and is in the same row as a 2, then it becomes 1. But this would not explain the example 1's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain patterns, such as a diagonal line.\n\nBut this is too vague. Another approach: look for the difference between input and output in example 1.\n\nIn example 1's output, the third row has 1s at positions 10 and 11. In the input, those positions are 0. The input row 3 has 2s at positions 2 and 15. Maybe the 1s are added in positions that are 8 columns away from the 2s. For example, 2+8=10, 15-8=7. But that doesn't fit. Or maybe the 1s are added in positions that are 8 columns to the left of the 2s. For example, 2-8 = -6, which is invalid. 15-8=7. But in the output, there are 1s at 10 and 11, which are not 7.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAnother idea: look for the transformation as a combination of operations. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in certain positions, which might be the result of some kind of pattern that is not directly based on the input values but on their positions.\n\nFor example, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row and column indices satisfy certain conditions. For example, if (row + column) is even, then replace 0 with 1. But in example 1, the output row 3 has 1s at positions 10 and 11. For row 3 (assuming row index 2), column 10: 2+10=12 (even). Column 11: 2+11=13 (odd). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where (row - column) is even. For example, row 3 (index 2), column 10: 2-10 = -8 (even). Column 11: 2-11 = -9 (odd). So only column 10 would be replaced. But the output has both 10 and 11 as 1s, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s form a line or a cross.\n\nBut without seeing more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain rows and columns. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are in rows 2 and 3, and columns 10-11. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain regions of the grid. For example, the middle part of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine which regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2, and in the same column as a 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the test input. The test input has 0s, 4s, and 1s. The output is not given, but the transformation should be applied to it. However, since I don't have the output, I need to rely on the training examples.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their coordinates. For example, if the row is even and the column is even, replace 0 with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are part of certain patterns. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are part of a diagonal line from the 2s.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2, and in the same column as a 2. For example, if a cell is 0 and is in the same row or column as a 2, then it becomes 1. But in example 1, the output row 2 has 2s, and the output is the same as input. So this would not change anything.\n\nBut in example 1's output row 3, there are 1s in positions 10 and 11. In the input row 3, there are 2s in positions 2 and 15. So if the 1s are in positions that are in the same row as 2s, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain rows and columns. For example, in example 1, the 1s are in rows 2 and 3, columns 10-11. But how to generalize.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern that is common across all examples. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in certain positions, and in example 2, the output has 1s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2 or 8, and in the same column as a 2 or 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain rows or columns. For example, rows 2, 3, 4, etc., and columns 10, 11, etc.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain patterns, like a cross. For example, in example 1, the 1s are in positions that form a cross.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2 and in the same column as a 2.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, maybe I should consider that the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their coordinates. For example, if the row is even, replace 0s with 1s in certain columns.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row and column indices are both even. For example, in example 1's output row 3, the 1s are at column 10 and 11. If row is 2 (even), column 10 is even, column 11 is odd. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row is even and the column is even. But this would not explain the example 1's output.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain regions of the grid, such as the middle part. For example, in example 1, the 1s are in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine which regions.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2 and in the same column as a 2. For example, if there is a 2 in row i, column j, then the cell at (i, j) is 2, and the cell at (i, j-8) is 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain patterns, like a diagonal line. For example, in example 1, the 1s are in positions that form a diagonal.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the examples I can see. For example, in example 1, the 1s are added in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2. Let's try to implement this.\n\nSo, for each cell in the grid, if the cell is 0, check if there is a 2 in the same row, and if the column is 8 positions to the right of this cell. If so, replace with 1.\n\nBut how to implement this. For each row, for each cell, if it is 0, check if there is a 2 in the same row, at column c = current column + 8. If yes, then replace with 1.\n\nBut this would only work for cells where the column +8 is within the grid.\n\nLet's test this on example 1's row 3. The input row 3 has 2 at column 2. So for column 2-8 = -6, which is invalid. But there is a 2 at column 15. For column 15-8=7. So if the current cell is 0 at column 7, it would be replaced with 1. But in the input row 3, column 7 is 1, so no change. But in the output, there are 1s at columns 10 and 11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this approach doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2, but only if the 2 is in the same row. For example, in example 1's row 3, there is a 2 at column 15. So 15-8=7, so column 7 would be replaced with 1. But in the input row 3, column 7 is 1, so no change. But in the output, there are 1s at columns 10 and 11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2, and 8 columns to the right of a 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2 or 8 columns to the right of a 2.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should consider that the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row and column indices are both even. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain rows or columns. For example, rows 2-4 and columns 10-12.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in the middle part of the grid. But how to determine the middle part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2 or 8, and in the same column as a 2 or 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2 or 8, and in the same column as a 2 or 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code would iterate through each cell. If the cell is 0, check if there is a 2 or 8 in the same row or column. If so, replace with 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to implement this.\n\nHowever, this might not work for all examples. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nBut how to implement this. For each cell (i, j), if grid[i][j] is 0, then check if there is any 2 or 8 in the same row or column. If yes, replace with 1.\n\nBut this would replace too many cells. For example, in example 1's input row 2, there are 2s, so all 0s in that row would be replaced with 1s. But in the output, the row is the same as input, so this is not correct.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in the same row as a 2 and in the same column as a 2. For example, if there is a 2 in (i, j), then the cell at (i, j) is 2, and the cell at (i, j-8) is 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2. So the code would look for 2s in the input, and for each 2, replace the cell 8 columns to the left with 1 if it's 0.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- Iterate over each cell in the input grid.\n- For each cell, if it is a 2, check if there is a cell 8 columns to the left (i.e., column -8). If that cell is 0, replace it with 1.\n- Similarly, for 8s in example 2, replace 0s 8 columns to the left with 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to implement this.\n\nSo, for each row in the input grid:\n\nfor i in range(23):\n    for j in range(25):\n        if grid[i][j] == 2:\n            if j - 8 >= 0:\n                if grid[i][j-8] == 0:\n                    new_grid[i][j-8] = 1\n\nBut this would only handle 2s. For example, in example 1, the 2s are at column 2 and 15. For column 2, j-8 = -6 (invalid). For column 15, j-8=7. So the cell at column 7 would be replaced with 1. But in the input row 3, column 7 is 1, so no change. But in the output, there are 1s at columns 10 and 11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe this is part of the transformation. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of 2s and 8 columns to the right of 2s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2 or 8 columns to the right of a 2.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are 8 columns to the left of a 2. This is based on example 1's output.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = [[0]*25 for _ in range(23)]\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(25):\n            new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                if j - 8 >= 0:\n                    new_grid[i][j-8] = 1\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this would replace 0s with 1s in positions 8 columns to the left of 2s. But this may not work for all examples. For example, in example 1's row 3, the 2 is at column 15, so j-8=7. So new_grid[i][7] is set to 1. But in the input row 3, column 7 is 1, so no change. But in the output, there are 1s at columns 10 and 11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps this is part of the transformation, and there are other patterns. For example, in example 1, there are other 2s in the grid that may contribute to other 1s.\n\nBut this is just a guess. I'll proceed with this code and see if it passes the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nHowever, this code may not work for the examples, but it's the best I can do based on the given information.\n"
