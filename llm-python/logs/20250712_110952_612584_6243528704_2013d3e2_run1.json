          "Let's analyze the examples:\n\n- Both training inputs are 10x10 grids, output grids are always 3x3.\n- The 3x3 output resembles a zoomed-in view of a meaningful 3x3 section from near the middle of the input.\n- This 3x3 is **not** just the center 3x3 (rows 4-6, cols 4-6) but often shifted slightly.\n- It seems to capture key objects or clusters near the center.\n  \nExample 1:\n- Input center approx at (4,4) to (6,6): values are mostly 4 and 8.\n- Output is:\n  ```\n  0 0 7\n  0 6 8\n  7 8 4\n  ```\n- Looking in input:\n  - Row 2 to 6, col 2 to 6 substantial 7,6,8,4 around (4,4).\n  - Output looks like a cropped 3x3 from (2,2)-(4,4) area or so.\n\nExample 2:\n- Output:\n  ```\n  1 0 0\n  0 3 6\n  0 5 2\n  ```\n- Input rows ~1-5, cols ~1-5 have those numbers.\n- Output is taken roughly from upper-left region covering non-zero patterns.\n\nHence, a hypothesis:\n- Output is a 3x3 crop of an area with non-zero values near the center, focusing on a cluster or shape.\n- Possibly the cluster with largest area (connected component) near center.\n- Extract the bounding 3x3 block around that cluster's upper-left or centroid.\n\nProposed approach:\n\n1. Find all non-zero positions.\n2. Find their centroid or bounding box.\n3. Extract a 3x3 block around that area (adjusting to stay within input bounds).\n4. Return that 3x3 block.\n\nThis works well for example 1 and 2 visually.\n\nWe will:\n\n- Determine bounding box of all non-zero elements.\n- Extract the top-left corner of the bounding box and use that as origin for 3x3 block.\n- If bounding box > 3x3, expand as needed to cover cluster's main shape.\n- To keep it simple, just extract the 3x3 block starting at min_row, min_col of bounding box (clipped inside grid).\n\nThis is a reasonable guess given examples.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation notes:**\n\n- Input grid is 10x10 (or similar).\n- Find min/max row and col of non-zero cells.\n- Extract 3x3 subgrid starting at (min_row, min_col).\n- If subgrid goes out of bounds, adjust start (max starting idx is grid_size-3).\n- If no non-zero found, return 3x3 zeros.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Determine bounding box of non-zero cells\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows>0 else 0\n    \n    non_zero_positions = [(r,c) for r in range(rows) for c in range(cols) if grid[r][c]!=0]\n    if not non_zero_positions:\n        # No non-zero, return 3x3 zeros\n        return [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    min_r = min(pos[0] for pos in non_zero_positions)\n    max_r = max(pos[0] for pos in non_zero_positions)\n    min_c = min(pos[1] for pos in non_zero_positions)\n    max_c = max(pos[1] for pos in non_zero_positions)\n    \n    # Choose start row/col for 3x3 block\n    # Try to start at min_r, min_c\n    start_r = min_r\n    start_c = min_c\n    \n    # Adjust if going out of bounds (grid assumed minimum 3x3)\n    if start_r > rows - 3:\n        start_r = rows - 3\n    if start_c > cols - 3:\n        start_c = cols - 3\n    if start_r < 0:\n        start_r = 0\n    if start_c < 0:\n        start_c = 0\n    \n    # Extract 3x3 block\n    out = []\n    for rr in range(start_r, start_r + 3):\n        row_vals = []\n        for cc in range(start_c, start_c + 3):\n            row_vals.append(grid[rr][cc])\n        out.append(row_vals)\n    \n    return out\n```\n"
