The output values seem to be derived from the input values through some transformation\n2. There's a pattern where 0s in the input become 1s or 0s in the output\n3. The number 2 in the input seems to transform into 4 or 8 in the output\n4. There's a pattern where certain positions in the input grid get transformed to specific values\n5. The output grid always has a 12x10 size\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Converts 0 to 1\n- Converts 2 to 4 or 8 based on position\n- Leaves other values as is\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 12x10 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(12)]\n    \n    # Process each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(12):\n        for col in range(10):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # Convert 0 to 1\n            if value == 0:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 1\n            # Convert 2 to 4 or 8 based on position\n            elif value == 2:\n                # Simple pattern: convert to 4 if in even row, 8 if in odd row\n                if row % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 4\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n            # Leave other values as is\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = value\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 12x10 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(12)]\n    \n    # Process each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(12):\n        for col in range(10):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # Convert 0 to 1\n            if value == 0:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 1\n            # Convert 2 to 4 or 8 based on position\n            elif value == 2:\n                # Simple pattern: convert to 4 if in even row, 8 if in odd row\n                if row % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 4\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n            # Leave other values as is\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = value\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns and create a transformation function.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that:\n1. The output values seem to be derived from the input values through some transformation\n2. There's a pattern where 0s in the input become 1s or 0s in the output\n3. The number 2 in the input seems to transform into 4 or 8 in the output\n4. There's a pattern where certain positions in the input grid get transformed to specific values\n5. The output grid always has a 12x10 size\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Converts 0 to 1\n- Converts 2 to 4 or 8 based on position\n- Leaves other values as is\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 12x10 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(12)]\n    \n    # Process each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(12):\n        for col in range(10):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # Convert 0 to 1\n            if value == 0:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 1\n            # Convert 2 to 4 or 8 based on position\n            elif value == 2:\n                # Simple pattern: convert to 4 if in even row, 8 if in odd row\n                if row % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 4\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n            # Leave other values as is\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = value\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 12x10 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(12)]\n    \n    # Process each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(12):\n        for col in range(10):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # Convert 0 to 1\n            if value == 0:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 1\n            # Convert 2 to 4 or 8 based on position\n            elif value == 2:\n                # Simple pattern: convert to 4 if in even row, 8 if in odd row\n                if row % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 4\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n            # Leave other values as is\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = value\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
