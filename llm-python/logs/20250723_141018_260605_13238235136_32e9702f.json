The central number in the input grid is surrounded by 0s.\n2. The central number and the surrounding 0s are replaced by a 5 in the output grid.\n\n### Implementation:\nLet's implement this pattern in a Python function.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Check if the current cell is the central cell and surrounded by 0s\n            if i > 0 and i < rows - 1 and j > 0 and j < cols - 1:\n                if grid[i-1][j] == 0 and grid[i+1][j] == 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 0 and grid[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                        grid[i][j] = 5\n                        grid[i-1][j] = 5\n                        grid[i+1][j] = 5\n                        grid[i][j-1] = 5\n                        grid[i][j+1] = 5\n    \n    return grid\n```\n\nThis function checks each cell in the grid to see if it is the central cell (not on the edge) and if it is surrounded by 0s. If both conditions are met, it replaces the central cell and its surrounding 0s with 5s.",
