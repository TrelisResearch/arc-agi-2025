The output grids seem to be formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input grid, and possibly applying some transformation to the values.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that the output grid appears to be formed by selecting specific rows and columns from the input grid, and then applying a transformation that involves taking the minimum value in certain positions.\n\nHere's my hypothesis for the transformation:\n1. Take the first 4 rows of the input grid\n2. For each of these rows, take the first 5 columns\n3. For each of these 4x5 subgrids, take the minimum value in each row\n4. The output grid is formed by taking the minimum values from these subgrids\n\nLet's implement this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take the first 4 rows of the input grid\n    rows = grid[:4]\n    \n    # For each row, take the first 5 columns\n    transformed_rows = []\n    for row in rows:\n        transformed_row = row[:5]\n        transformed_rows.append(transformed_row)\n    \n    # Take the minimum value in each row\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in transformed_rows:\n        min_value = min(row)\n        transformed_grid.append([min_value] * 5)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take the first 4 rows of the input grid\n    rows = grid[:4]\n    \n    # For each row, take the first 5 columns\n    transformed_rows = []\n    for row in rows:\n        transformed_row = row[:5]\n        transformed_rows.append(transformed_row)\n    \n    # Take the minimum value in each row\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in transformed_rows:\n        min_value = min(row)\n        transformed_grid.append([min_value] * 5)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
