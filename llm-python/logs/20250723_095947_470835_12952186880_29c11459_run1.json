The first and last rows remain unchanged (all 0s)\n2. The middle rows show some transformation:\n   - The first and last elements of the row are preserved\n   - The middle elements are transformed based on the values at the ends\n   - Specifically, if the first element is 1 and the last is 2, the middle elements become 1s and 2s\n   - If the first element is 3 and the last is 7, the middle elements become 3s and 7s\n   - This suggests a pattern where the middle elements are filled with the first value for a certain number of positions, then the last value for the remaining positions\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Leaves the first and last rows unchanged\n- For each middle row:\n  - If the first element is 0, leave the row unchanged\n  - Otherwise, fill the row with the first value for a certain number of positions, then the last value for the remaining positions\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # The first and last rows remain unchanged\n    for i in range(5):\n        if i == 0 or i == 4:\n            continue  # Skip first and last rows\n    \n    # Process middle rows\n    for i in range(1, 4):  # Rows 1, 2, 3 (0-based)\n        row = grid[i]\n        if row[0] == 0 or row[-1] == 0:\n            continue  # Skip if first or last element is 0\n        \n        # The first element is the left value, the last is the right value\n        left = row[0]\n        right = row[-1]\n        \n        # Fill the row with left value for a certain number of positions,\n        # then right value for the remaining positions\n        # The number of positions for left value is determined by the difference\n        # between the right and left values\n        # This is a hypothesis based on the training examples\n        if left < right:\n            num_left = right - left\n            num_right = 11 - num_left - 2  # Subtract 2 for the first and last elements\n        else:\n            num_left = left - right\n            num_right = 11 - num_left - 2\n        \n        # Create the transformed row\n        transformed_row = [left] * num_left + [right] * num_right\n        \n        # Ensure the row has exactly 11 elements\n        if len(transformed_row) != 11:\n            transformed_row = [left] * 11\n        \n        transformed_grid[i] = transformed_row\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (5x11)\n2. The value 0 in the input grid is preserved in the output grid\n3. The values 1 and 2 in the input grid are \"expanded\" into a line of the same value, with 5 in the middle\n4. The values 3 and 7 in the input grid are \"expanded\" into a line of the same value, with 5 in the middle\n5. The values 4 and 8 in the input grid are \"expanded\" into a line of the same value, with 5 in the middle\n6. The values 6 and 9 in the input grid are \"expanded\" into a line of the same value, with 5 in the middle\n\nThis suggests that any non-zero value in the input grid is replaced with a line of the same value, with 5 in the middle.
