From the examples, I notice that:\n\n1. The output grid maintains the same dimensions (7x11) as the input grid.\n2. There seems to be a pattern of alternating 2s and 0s in a checkerboard-like pattern.\n3. The output grid appears to be a transformation that flips or rotates certain parts of the input grid.\n4. There are some consistent patterns in the output that suggest a transformation involving flipping or rotating certain rows or columns.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves flipping certain rows or columns in the input grid to produce the output grid.\n\nHere is my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Flip rows 1 and 2\n    transformed_grid[1], transformed_grid[2] = transformed_grid[2], transformed_grid[1]\n    \n    # Flip columns 3 and 4\n    for i in range(7):\n        transformed_grid[i][3], transformed_grid[i][4] = transformed_grid[i][4], transformed_grid[i][3]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
