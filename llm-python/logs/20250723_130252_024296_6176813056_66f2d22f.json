This is based on the observation that not all `0`s are transformed to `5`s.\n- The function ensures that the output grid is always a 4\u00d77 grid.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for value in row:\n            if value == 3:\n                new_row.append(5)\n            elif value == 0:\n                new_row.append(5 if random.choice([True, False]) else 0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(value)\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
