In Example 1, certain numbers seem to be copied from one position to another in a specific pattern.\n2. In Example 3, the output seems to be a transformation where certain positions are filled with values based on their position in the grid.\n3. In Example 4, the output seems to be a transformation where certain positions are filled with values based on their position in the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves copying values from specific positions to other positions in a pattern that depends on their position in the grid.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(17):\n        for j in range(17):\n            # If the cell is not zero, copy it to a specific position\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Copy to a specific position based on the original position\n                # This is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the examples\n                # The pattern is not fully clear, but this is my best guess\n                new_i = i % 4\n                new_j = j % 4\n                transformed_grid[new_i][new_j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(17):\n        for j in range(17):\n            # If the cell is not zero, copy it to a specific position\n            # This is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the examples\n            # The pattern is not fully clear, but this is my best guess\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Copy to a specific position based on the original position\n                new_i = i % 4\n                new_j = j % 4\n                transformed_grid[new_i][new_j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
