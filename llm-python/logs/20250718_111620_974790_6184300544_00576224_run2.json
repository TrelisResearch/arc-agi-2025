    "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find a pattern that maps input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output grid seems to be a repetition of the input grid in a specific pattern. For example, in the first training example, the input is:\n8 6\n6 4\n\nAnd the output is:\n8 6 8 6 8 6\n6 4 6 4 6 4\n6 8 6 8 6 8\n4 6 4 6 4 6\n8 6 8 6 8 6\n6 4 6 4 6 4\n\nThis suggests that the output is a 6x6 grid formed by repeating the input in a specific pattern. The pattern seems to be a combination of the input rows and columns in a specific order.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that the output grid is formed by:\n1. Repeating the first row of the input 3 times\n2. Repeating the second row of the input 3 times\n3. Repeating the first row of the input in reverse order 3 times\n4. Repeating the second row of the input in reverse order 3 times\n\nThis pattern creates a 6x6 grid from a 2x2 input grid.\n\nBased on this pattern, I'll write a Python function that implements this transformation.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Extract the two rows from the input grid\n    row1 = grid[0]\n    row2 = grid[1]\n    \n    # Create the output grid by repeating the rows in the observed pattern\n    transformed_grid = [\n        row1 + row1 + row1,\n        row2 + row2 + row2,\n        row1[::-1] + row1[::-1] + row1[::-1],\n        row2[::-1] + row2[::-1] + row2[::-1]\n    ]\n    \n    # Since the output must be a 6x6 grid, we need to extend it\n    # by adding the first two rows again\n    transformed_grid += transformed_grid[:2]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
