          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the training examples. Let's look at the examples and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has a bunch of 0s and 2s, and the output has 0s, 2s, and 8s. The output seems to have some 8s replacing certain 2s. Let me check the positions where 8s appear. For instance, in the first row of the output, the 8s are at positions 6, 7, and 8. Looking at the input, maybe those positions had 2s in the original grid. But how does that relate to the rest?\n\nLooking at the first input row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2. The output first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 2 0 0 2 8 2 0 0 2 2 8. So the 8s are replacing some 2s. But why those positions?\n\nMaybe there's a pattern based on the positions of the 2s. For example, in the input, the 2s are in certain regions. Maybe the output replaces 2s with 8s when they are in certain positions relative to other elements. Or maybe it's based on the distance from the edges or some other criteria.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, there are 8s in positions where the original input had 2s, but in some cases, the 8s are placed in positions that are symmetric or in certain patterns. For example, the first row's 8s are at positions 6, 7, 8. Wait, maybe the 8s are replacing 2s that are in certain positions, like the middle of a block.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Example 1, the input has a row of 3s. The output for that row has 0s and 2s. Wait, in the input, the fifth row is all 3s. The output for that row is all 0s except for some 2s. Wait, looking at the output for the fifth row of Example 1: it's 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that row is all zeros. But the input had 3s. So maybe the 3s are being replaced with 0s? Or maybe the 3s are in a certain area that's being ignored.\n\nWait, but in the input, there's a row of 3s. In the output, that row is all 0s. So perhaps the 3s are being replaced with 0s? But then, in other parts of the grid, like the sixth row of input, which is all 3s, the output is a mix of 0s and 2s. Wait, no, in the sixth row of the input, the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe the 3s are being transformed into 0s, but in some cases, they are transformed into 2s or 8s. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are part of a different pattern. Let me think about the other examples. In Example 2, the input has 2s, 0s, and 3s. The output has 8s, 2s, and 0s. For example, in the first input row of Example 2, the output is 8 2 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 0 0. So the 3s in the input are being replaced with 0s, but some positions have 8s. Wait, but in the input, the third row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3. The output for that row is 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. So the 3s are replaced with 0s, but the 2 in the sixth position is kept. Maybe the 3s are being replaced with 0s, but in some cases, the 2s are being replaced with 8s or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation depends on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain position relative to the edges, or if it's part of a certain shape.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again. The output has 8s in certain positions. For example, in the first row of the output, the 8s are at positions 6, 7, 8. But in the input, those positions were 2s. So perhaps when a 2 is in a certain position, it's replaced with 8. But why those positions?\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are symmetric. For instance, the first row's 8s are at positions 6, 7, 8. Then in the third row of output, there's 8s at positions 6 and 7. Wait, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like the middle of a block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 2s that are in certain regions. For example, in the input, there are blocks of 2s. The output replaces some of those 2s with 8s. For example, in the first row of input, there's a block of three 2s in the middle. The output replaces the middle 2 with 8? Or maybe the 8s are placed where the 2s are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross or a certain shape. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has 2s and 3s. The output has 8s and 2s. For example, the first row of input is 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3. The output is 8 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 8. So the 3s in the input are replaced with 0s and 2s. The first cell is 2 in input, becomes 8 in output. So maybe the 2s in certain positions are being replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nAnother approach: look for transformations that are consistent across examples. For instance, in Example 1, the output has 8s in certain positions. In Example 2, the output has 8s in certain positions. In Example 3, the output has 8s in certain positions. So perhaps the 8s are being placed where the original grid has 2s that are in certain positions, like in the middle of a block.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a block of 2s. Let me look at the input for Example 1. The first row of input has 2s at positions 6,7,8. The output for that row has 8s at positions 6,7,8. Wait, but in the first row of the output, the 8s are at positions 6,7,8. But in the input, those positions were 2s. So maybe the 2s in those positions are replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in certain positions, like in the middle of a block. For example, in the first row, the 2s are in positions 6-8. The output replaces them with 8s. Then in other rows, similar positions are replaced.\n\nBut then, looking at the third row of input for Example 1: 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0. So no 8s here. So that suggests that the 2s in that row are not replaced. So why in the first row are they replaced?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first row, the 2s are in the middle of the row. Then, in the output, those are replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original grid has 2s that are in certain positions relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 0s, then it's replaced with 8. Or if it's part of a certain shape.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s might be replacing 2s that are in certain positions, such as the middle of a block. For example, in the first row of input, the 2s are in the middle, so they are replaced with 8s. But in other rows, the 2s are in different positions and not replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For instance, in the first row, the 2s are in positions 6-8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let me check the input and output. The input is given as 19x19 grid, but the examples show rows with 19 elements. For example, the first input row of Example 1 is 19 elements. So the positions are 0-based or 1-based? Probably 0-based.\n\nIn the first row of input for Example 1, the first row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2\n\nSo positions 0-18. The 2s are at positions 6,7,8, then 11,12,13, then 16,17,18. Wait, no. Let me count:\n\nThe first row is 19 elements. Let's split them:\n\nIndices 0-18:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2\n\nSo the 2s are at positions 6,7,8 (indices 6-8), then 11,12,13 (indices 11-13), then 16,17,18 (indices 16-18). The output for this row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 2 0 0 2 8 2 0 0 2 2 8\n\nSo the 8s are at positions 6, 12, and 18. Wait, but in the input, the 2s at positions 6-8 are replaced with 8 at position 6, and 2 at 7, 2 at 8. Then at position 12, the input has 2, and output has 8. At position 18, input has 2, output has 8.\n\nSo perhaps the 8s are replacing the 2s that are in certain positions, like the middle of a block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions where the original cell is part of a certain shape. For example, in the first row, the 2s are in three blocks. The output replaces the middle of each block with 8. For example, the first block of three 2s (positions 6-8) has the middle cell (position 7) replaced with 2, but the output has 8 in position 6. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in the middle of a certain pattern. For example, in the first row, the 2s are in positions 6-8. The output has 8 in position 6, 2 in 7, 2 in 8. Then, in the next block (positions 11-13), the output has 2 in position 11, 8 in 12, 2 in 13. Then in the third block (positions 16-18), 2 in 16, 2 in 17, 8 in 18. So the 8s are replacing the middle of each block. Wait, but in the first block, the middle is position 7 (index 6,7,8: middle is 7). But the output has 8 at position 6, which is the first of the three. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like the positions that are in the middle of the grid. Or maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is in a certain position relative to the edges.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in certain positions. Let's see if there's a pattern in the positions of the 8s. For example, the first row has 8s at positions 6, 12, 18. The second row of output has 8s at position 6 (but in the second row, the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So no 8s in the second row. The third row of output has 8s at positions 6 and 7? Wait, no. The third row of output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0. So no 8s. The fourth row of output is 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0. No 8s. The fifth row is all zeros. The sixth row of output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no 8s. The seventh row of output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So here, position 6 is 8. The eighth row has 8 in position 6. The ninth row has 8 in position 6. The tenth row has no 8s. The eleventh row has 8 in position 0 and 18? Wait, the eleventh row of output is:\n\n0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. No 8s. The twelfth row has 8 in position 0 and 18? Let me check. The twelfth row of output is 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. No 8s. The thirteenth row of output is 8 2 2 0 0 2 8 2 0 0 2 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. So here, positions 0, 6, 12, 18 are 8. Wait, that's a lot. So the 8s are in positions that are part of certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is in a certain position relative to the edges. For example, in the first row, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. These are positions that are 6 units from the left, 12 units from the left, and 18 units from the left. But that's the same as the position in the row. So maybe it's the middle of the grid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are part of certain lines or patterns. For example, in the first row of output, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. These are spaced 6 units apart. Maybe this is a pattern of 8s placed at positions that are multiples of 6. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: in the output of Example 1, the 8s are placed where the original input had 2s that are in certain positions. For example, in the first row, the 2s are at positions 6-8, 11-13, 16-18. The output replaces the 2s at positions 6, 12, 18 with 8. But why those positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in the first row, the 2s are in three blocks. The first block is positions 6-8. The output replaces the first position of that block (6) with 8. Then the second block (positions 11-13) has the middle position (12) replaced with 8. The third block (16-18) has the last position (18) replaced with 8. So the 8s are placed at the first, middle, and last positions of each block. That seems like a possible pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize that? For example, if a block of 2s is present, then the 8s are placed at the first, middle, and last positions of each block. But how to detect those blocks.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first row, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. These positions are 6 units from the left, which is the middle of the first third of the row. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like the middle of the grid. For example, in the first row, the middle of the grid is position 9 (since 19 elements, 0-based, middle is 9). But the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18, which are not the middle.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 2. The input has 2s, 0s, and 3s. The output has 8s, 2s, and 0s. For example, the first row of input is 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 3 3. The output is 8 2 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 0 0. So the 3s are replaced with 0s, and the 2s are replaced with 8s in certain positions. For example, the first cell is 2 in input, becomes 8 in output. The second cell is 2, becomes 2. The fifth cell is 2, becomes 2. The sixth cell is 2, becomes 8. So why is the first and sixth positions replaced with 8s?\n\nIn the input for Example 2, the first row has 2s at positions 0, 1, 4, 5. The output has 8s at positions 0 and 5. So maybe the 8s are placed at the ends of the blocks of 2s. For example, the first block of 2s is positions 0-1. The output replaces the first position (0) with 8. The next block of 2s is positions 4-5. The output replaces the first position (4) with 2 and the second (5) with 8. So the 8 is at the end of the block.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. How to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in certain positions relative to the edges. For example, in the first row of Example 2, the first 2 is at position 0 (left edge), and the sixth 2 is at position 5 (which is the end of the block). So maybe the 8s are placed at the ends of the blocks of 2s.\n\nBut how to detect blocks of 2s. For example, in the input, the 2s are in contiguous blocks. So perhaps the transformation is to replace the first and last elements of each block of 2s with 8s.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's test it against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row of input has three blocks of 2s. The first block is positions 6-8 (length 3). The first element of this block is position 6. According to the hypothesis, this would be replaced with 8. But in the output, position 6 is 8. Then the last element of this block is position 8, which is replaced with 2. But in the output, position 8 is 2. So that doesn't fit. However, the second block is positions 11-13. The first element is 11, which is 2 in input. In the output, position 11 is 2. The last element is 13, which is 8. So that fits. The third block is positions 16-18. The first element is 16 (2), which is 2 in output. The last element is 18 (2), which is 8 in output. So this fits. So for the first block, the first element is replaced with 8, and the last element is 2. But why?\n\nThis seems inconsistent. So perhaps the hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in certain positions, like the middle of the block. For example, in the first block of 3 2s, the middle is position 7. In the output, that position is 2. But in the output, position 6 is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of certain lines. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. These positions are spaced 6 units apart. But 6 is 19/3.3... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of a diagonal. For example, in the first row, position 6 is part of a diagonal. But I don't see a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like the middle of the grid. For example, the middle of the grid is at position 9 (for a 19x19 grid). But the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like the positions that are in the same row as the 3s. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is all 3s. The output for that row is all 0s. So maybe the 3s are being replaced with 0s, and the 2s in the same row are replaced with 8s? But that doesn't fit. Because in the fifth row of the input, the 3s are all 3s, but the output is all 0s. But the input for the fifth row is all 3s, and the output is all 0s. So maybe the 3s are replaced with 0s. But in other rows, like the sixth row of the input, which is all 3s, the output has some 2s and 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being replaced with 0s, and the 2s are being replaced with 8s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row of 3s, which is replaced with 0s. But the sixth row of the input is all 3s, and the output has some 2s and 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 2s and 3s. The output has 8s and 2s. For example, the first row of input is 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3. The output is 8 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 8. So the 3s are replaced with 0s and 2s. The first cell is 2 in input, becomes 8. The last cell is 3, becomes 8. So maybe the 3s are replaced with 0s, but some positions are replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position. For example, in Example 3, the first row of input has 2s at positions 0 and 2. The output has 8 at position 0 and 2 at position 2. So the first 2 is replaced with 8, but the second 2 is kept. So why?\n\nMaybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is part of a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a certain position relative to the edges. For instance, in the first row of Example 3, the 2 at position 0 is at the left edge. Maybe that's why it's replaced with 8. But the 2 at position 2 is in the middle, so it's kept. But how to generalize that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is part of a certain shape, like a cross or a line. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the 2s are in blocks. The 8s are placed at the ends of those blocks.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows:\n\n- The 3s are replaced with 0s.\n- The 2s are replaced with 8s in certain positions, like the edges or certain patterns.\n- The 0s are kept as is.\n\nBut how to determine which 2s are replaced with 8s.\n\nLooking at the first example, the 3s are replaced with 0s in certain rows. For example, the fifth row of input is all 3s, and the output is all 0s. The sixth row of input is all 3s, and the output has some 2s and 0s. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the 3s are replaced with 0s only in certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replaced with 0s in rows where there are certain patterns. For example, if a row is all 3s, then replace them with 0s. But in the sixth row of Example 1, the input is all 3s, and the output has some 2s and 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are part of certain lines. For example, in the first row, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. These are positions that are multiples of 6. 6, 12, 18 are all multiples of 6. But 6 is 19/3.333... Not sure. Alternatively, these positions are spaced 6 units apart. Maybe this is a pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize this. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. These are the positions that are 6 units from the left edge, 12 units from the left edge, and 18 units from the left edge. But for a 19x19 grid, these positions are in the middle of the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed at positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in the first row, the middle is position 9. But the 8s are at 6, 12, 18. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed at positions that are part of a certain pattern, like the positions that are in the same column as the 3s. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is all 3s. The output for that row is all 0s. So maybe the columns where 3s appear are replaced with 0s. But that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 8s if they are in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, or if it's part of a certain pattern. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position relative to the 3s. For example, if the cell is adjacent to a 3, it's replaced with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position relative to the edges. For example, if the cell is in the first third of the row, replace it with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to think of the transformation as replacing 2s with 8s in certain positions, and 3s with 0s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 8s where the cell is in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in the first third of the row, or the second third, or the third third.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is part of a certain shape. For example, in the first example, the 2s are in blocks, and the 8s are placed at the ends of those blocks.\n\nSo, the code could look for blocks of 2s and replace the first and last elements of each block with 8s. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, the blocks are 6-8, 11-13, 16-18. The first element of each block is 6, 11, 16. The last element is 8, 13, 18. According to the hypothesis, the first element of each block is replaced with 8. So in the first block, position 6 becomes 8. In the second block, position 11 becomes 8. In the third block, position 16 becomes 8. But in the output, position 11 is 2, and position 16 is 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in the output of the first row of Example 1, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. So position 12 is the middle of the second block (positions 11-13). So maybe the middle of the block is replaced with 8.\n\nIn the first block (6-8), the middle is 7. But in the output, position 7 is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Perhaps I should look for other patterns.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are part of certain lines. For example, in the first row, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. These are positions that are 6 units apart. In a 19x19 grid, 6 is 19/3.333... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in the same column as a certain pattern. For example, in the first column of the input, the first row is 0, second row is 0, third row is 0, fourth row is 0, fifth row is 3, sixth row is 3, seventh row is 3, etc. So maybe the columns with 3s are replaced with 0s. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position relative to the 3s. For example, if the cell is in the same row as a 3, it's replaced with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, perhaps I should try to code a transformation that replaces 2s with 8s in certain positions and 3s with 0s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the 3s are replaced with 0s. So in the code, any cell with 3 is replaced with 0.\n\nFor the 2s, perhaps replace them with 8s if they are in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in the first third of the row or the third third, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position relative to the edges. For example, if the cell is in the first third of the row, replace it with 8.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the cell is in a certain pattern, like the middle of the grid. For example, in a 19x19 grid, the middle is at row 9, column 9. So cells that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 8s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the cell is part of a certain pattern, like the middle of a block of 2s.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for the following:\n\nIn all examples, the output has 8s where the input had 2s, but in certain positions. So maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position relative to the 3s. For example, in the first example, the 3s are in the fifth row. The output for that row is all 0s. So maybe the 3s are replaced with 0s, and the 2s in the same row are replaced with 8s. But in the sixth row of the input, which is all 3s, the output has some 2s and 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a row that has a 3, then it's replaced with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let's try to code a transformation that replaces 3s with 0s, and replaces 2s with 8s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in the middle of the grid. For example, for a 19x19 grid, the middle is at (9,9). So cells that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 8s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position, like the first third of the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in the same column as a 3.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the 3s are replaced with 0s, and the 2s are replaced with 8s in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the 2s in the first row are replaced with 8s at certain positions.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the code can replace 3s with 0s, and for 2s, replace them with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the first third of the row.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 2s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the middle of the row or column.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in the same row as a 3. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is all 3s. The output for that row is all 0s. So the 2s in other rows are replaced with 8s if they are in the same row as a 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll try to write code that replaces 3s with 0s, and replaces 2s with 8s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine those positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position, like the middle of the grid.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for the number of 8s in the output. In Example 1, there are several 8s. In Example 2, there are 8s in certain positions. In Example 3, there are 8s in certain positions.\n\nMaybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain pattern, like a diagonal.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll have to proceed with a possible transformation that replaces 3s with 0s, and replaces 2s with 8s in certain positions.\n\nFor example, replace 3s with 0s, and replace 2s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nMaybe the code can iterate over each cell and check if it is 2, and if it is in the middle of the grid, replace it with 8.\n\nBut for a 19x19 grid, the middle is at row 9, column 9. So cells in row 9 and column 9 are replaced with 8s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, replace 2s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the first third of the row.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write code that replaces 3s with 0s, and replaces 2s with 8s in certain positions, like the middle of the grid.\n\nBut this is likely not correct, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Replace 3s with 0s\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    # Replace 2s with 8s in certain positions\n    # For example, replace 2s in the middle of the grid\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2 and (i == 9 or j == 9):\n                transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. In Example 1, the middle of the grid is at (9,9). But in the output of Example 1, there are 8s in various positions, not just the middle. So this code would not work for Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace 2s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the first third of the row.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in the same row as a 3. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row has 3s. The output for that row is all 0s. So the 2s in other rows are replaced with 8s if they are in the same row as a 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll try to write code that replaces 3s with 0s, and replaces 2s with 8s if they are in the same row as a 3.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Replace 3s with 0s\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    # Replace 2s with 8s if they are in the same row as a 3\n    for i in range(19):\n        has_3 = False\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                has_3 = True\n                break\n        if has_3:\n            for j in range(19):\n                if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nThis code replaces 3s with 0s, and replaces 2s with 8s in any row that has a 3. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the fifth row is all 3s. So any 2 in that row is replaced with 8. But in the fifth row of the input, the row is all 3s, so no 2s. So this would not affect it. The sixth row of input is all 3s, so any 2 in that row is replaced with 8. But the input for the sixth row is all 3s, so no 2s. So this would not affect it. But in the output of Example 1, the sixth row has 2s and 0s. So this code would not work.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are part of certain patterns. For example, the first row has 8s at positions 6, 12, 18. These are positions that are 6 units from the left, 12 units from the left, and 18 units from the left. These are positions that are multiples of 6. So maybe the 8s are placed at positions where the column is a multiple of 6.\n\nBut for a 19x19 grid, 6, 12, 18 are multiples of 6. So perhaps the code replaces 2s with 8s if their column is a multiple of 6.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, the 2s are at columns 6, 11, 16. The columns 6, 12, 18 are multiples of 6. So in the first row, the 2 at column 6 is replaced with 8. The 2 at column 11 is not a multiple of 6, so it remains 2. The 2 at column 16 is not a multiple of 6, so it remains 2. But in the output, the 2 at column 12 is replaced with 8. But 12 is a multiple of 6. So this suggests that the code replaces 2s with 8s if their column is a multiple of 6.\n\nBut in the first row, the 2 at column 6 is replaced with 8. The 2 at column 12 is replaced with 8. The 2 at column 18 is replaced with 8. So this fits.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row has 2s at columns 6, 11, 16. The output replaces 6, 12, 18 with 8. But 12 is not a column where there is a 2 in the input. Wait, in the first row of input, the 2s are at columns 6, 11, 16. So the 12th column is 0 in the input. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nThe transformation replaces 3s with 0s, and replaces 2s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the middle of the grid or certain columns.\n\nBut since I can't determine the exact pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8s are placed at positions that are in certain columns. For example, in the first row, the 8s are at columns 6, 12, 18. These are columns that are 6, 12, 18. So for a 19x19 grid, these are columns 6, 12, 18. So perhaps the code replaces 2s with 8s if their column is 6, 12, or 18.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Replace 3s with 0s\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    # Replace 2s with 8s in certain columns\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2 and j in [6, 12, 18]:\n                transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would only replace 2s in columns 6, 12, 18, which may not fit all examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the first row of input is 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 3 3. The output is 8 2 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2s at columns 0 and 1 are replaced with 8 and 2. The 2 at column 5 is replaced with 8. So in this case, the columns 0, 1, 5 are replaced. But according to the code above, columns 6, 12, 18 are the only ones replaced. So this code would not work for Example 2.\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the examples.\n\nMaybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in the same row as a 3.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nIn Example 1, the fifth row is all 3s. So any 2 in that row is replaced with 8. But in the fifth row of the input, there are no 2s, so this would not affect it. In the sixth row of the input, which is all 3s, there are no 2s, so no replacement. But in the output of Example 1, the sixth row has some 2s and 0s. So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess that the transformation is to replace 3s with 0s, and replace 2s with 8s in certain positions, like the middle of the grid or certain columns.\n\nBut since I can't determine the exact pattern, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 3s with 0s and replaces 2s with 8s in certain positions, like the middle of the grid.\n\nFinal code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Replace 3s with 0s\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    # Replace 2s with 8s in the middle of the grid\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2 and (i == 9 or j == 9):\n                transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nThis is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the training examples. Let's look at the examples and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has a bunch of 0s and 2s, and the output has 0s, 2s, and 8s. The output seems to have some 8s replacing certain 2s. Let me check the positions where 8s appear. For instance, in the first row of the output, the 8s are at positions 6, 7, and 8. Looking at the input, maybe those positions had 2s in the original grid. But how does that relate to the rest?\n\nLooking at the first input row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2. The output first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 2 0 0 2 8 2 0 0 2 2 8. So the 8s are replacing some 2s. But why those positions?\n\nMaybe there's a pattern based on the positions of the 2s. For example, in the input, the 2s are in certain regions. Maybe the output replaces 2s with 8s when they are in certain positions relative to other elements. Or maybe it's based on the distance from the edges or some other criteria.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, there are 8s in positions where the original input had 2s, but in some cases, the 8s are placed in positions that are symmetric or in certain patterns. For example, the first row's 8s are at positions 6, 7, 8. Wait, maybe the 8s are replacing 2s that are in certain positions, like the middle of a block.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Example 1, the input has a row of 3s. The output for that row has 0s and 2s. Wait, in the input, the fifth row is all 3s. The output for that row is all 0s except for some 2s. Wait, looking at the output for the fifth row of Example 1: it's 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that row is all zeros. But the input had 3s. So maybe the 3s are being replaced with 0s? Or maybe the 3s are in a certain area that's being ignored.\n\nWait, but in the input, there's a row of 3s. In the output, that row is all 0s. So perhaps the 3s are being replaced with 0s? But then, in other parts of the grid, like the sixth row of input, which is all 3s, the output is a mix of 0s and 2s. Wait, no, in the sixth row of the input, the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe the 3s are being transformed into 0s, but in some cases, they are transformed into 2s or 8s. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are part of a different pattern. Let me think about the other examples. In Example 2, the input has 2s, 0s, and 3s. The output has 8s, 2s, and 0s. For example, in the first input row of Example 2, the output is 8 2 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 0 0. So the 3s in the input are being replaced with 0s, but some positions have 8s. Wait, but in the input, the third row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3. The output for that row is 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. So the 3s are replaced with 0s, but the 2 in the sixth position is kept. Maybe the 3s are being replaced with 0s, but in some cases, the 2s are being replaced with 8s or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation depends on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain position relative to the edges, or if it's part of a certain shape.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again. The output has 8s in certain positions. For example, in the first row of the output, the 8s are at positions 6, 7, 8. But in the input, those positions were 2s. So perhaps when a 2 is in a certain position, it's replaced with 8. But why those positions?\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are symmetric. For instance, the first row's 8s are at positions 6, 7, 8. Then in the third row of output, there's 8s at positions 6 and 7. Wait, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like the middle of a block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 2s that are in certain regions. For example, in the input, there are blocks of 2s. The output replaces some of those 2s with 8s. For example, in the first row of input, there's a block of three 2s in the middle. The output replaces the middle 2 with 8? Or maybe the 8s are placed where the 2s are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross or a certain shape. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has 2s and 3s. The output has 8s and 2s. For example, the first row of input is 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3. The output is 8 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 8. So the 3s in the input are replaced with 0s and 2s. The first cell is 2 in input, becomes 8 in output. So maybe the 2s in certain positions are being replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nAnother approach: look for transformations that are consistent across examples. For instance, in Example 1, the output has 8s in certain positions. In Example 2, the output has 8s in certain positions. In Example 3, the output has 8s in certain positions. So perhaps the 8s are being placed where the original grid has 2s that are in certain positions, like in the middle of a block.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a block of 2s. Let me look at the input for Example 1. The first row of input has 2s at positions 6,7,8. The output for that row has 8s at positions 6,7,8. Wait, but in the first row of the output, the 8s are at positions 6,7,8. But in the input, those positions were 2s. So maybe the 2s in those positions are replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in certain positions, like in the middle of a block. For example, in the first row, the 2s are in positions 6-8. The output replaces them with 8s. Then in other rows, similar positions are replaced.\n\nBut then, looking at the third row of input for Example 1: 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0. So no 8s here. So that suggests that the 2s in that row are not replaced. So why in the first row are they replaced?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first row, the 2s are in the middle of the row. Then, in the output, those are replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original grid has 2s that are in certain positions relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 0s, then it's replaced with 8. Or if it's part of a certain shape.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s might be replacing 2s that are in certain positions, such as the middle of a block. For example, in the first row of input, the 2s are in the middle, so they are replaced with 8s. But in other rows, the 2s are in different positions and not replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For instance, in the first row, the 2s are in positions 6-8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let me check the input and output. The input is given as 19x19 grid, but the examples show rows with 19 elements. For example, the first input row of Example 1 is 19 elements. So the positions are 0-based or 1-based? Probably 0-based.\n\nIn the first row of input for Example 1, the first row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2\n\nSo positions 0-18. The 2s are at positions 6,7,8, then 11,12,13, then 16,17,18. Wait, no. Let me count:\n\nThe first row is 19 elements. Let's split them:\n\nIndices 0-18:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2\n\nSo the 2s are at positions 6,7,8 (indices 6-8), then 11,12,13 (indices 11-13), then 16,17,18 (indices 16-18). The output for this row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 2 0 0 2 8 2 0 0 2 2 8\n\nSo the 8s are at positions 6, 12, and 18. Wait, but in the input, the 2s at positions 6-8 are replaced with 8 at position 6, and 2 at 7, 2 at 8. Then at position 12, the input has 2, and output has 8. At position 18, input has 2, output has 8.\n\nSo perhaps the 8s are replacing the 2s that are in certain positions, like the middle of a block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions where the original cell is part of a certain shape. For example, in the first row, the 2s are in three blocks. The output replaces the middle of each block with 8. For example, the first block of three 2s (positions 6-8) has the middle cell (position 7) replaced with 2, but the output has 8 in position 6. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in the middle of a certain pattern. For example, in the first row, the 2s are in positions 6-8. The output has 8 in position 6, 2 in 7, 2 in 8. Then, in the next block (positions 11-13), the output has 2 in position 11, 8 in 12, 2 in 13. Then in the third block (positions 16-18), 2 in 16, 2 in 17, 8 in 18. So the 8s are replacing the middle of each block. Wait, but in the first block, the middle is position 7 (index 6,7,8: middle is 7). But the output has 8 at position 6, which is the first of the three. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like the positions that are in the middle of the grid. Or maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is in a certain position relative to the edges.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in certain positions. Let's see if there's a pattern in the positions of the 8s. For example, the first row has 8s at positions 6, 12, 18. The second row of output has 8s at position 6 (but in the second row, the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So no 8s in the second row. The third row of output has 8s at positions 6 and 7? Wait, no. The third row of output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0. So no 8s. The fourth row of output is 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0. No 8s. The fifth row is all zeros. The sixth row of output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no 8s. The seventh row of output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So here, position 6 is 8. The eighth row has 8 in position 6. The ninth row has 8 in position 6. The tenth row has no 8s. The eleventh row has 8 in position 0 and 18? Wait, the eleventh row of output is:\n\n0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. No 8s. The twelfth row has 8 in position 0 and 18? Let me check. The twelfth row of output is 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. No 8s. The thirteenth row of output is 8 2 2 0 0 2 8 2 0 0 2 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. So here, positions 0, 6, 12, 18 are 8. Wait, that's a lot. So the 8s are in positions that are part of certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is in a certain position relative to the edges. For example, in the first row, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. These are positions that are 6 units from the left, 12 units from the left, and 18 units from the left. But that's the same as the position in the row. So maybe it's the middle of the grid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are part of certain lines or patterns. For example, in the first row of output, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. These are spaced 6 units apart. Maybe this is a pattern of 8s placed at positions that are multiples of 6. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: in the output of Example 1, the 8s are placed where the original input had 2s that are in certain positions. For example, in the first row, the 2s are at positions 6-8, 11-13, 16-18. The output replaces the 2s at positions 6, 12, 18 with 8. But why those positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in the first row, the 2s are in three blocks. The first block is positions 6-8. The output replaces the first position of that block (6) with 8. Then the second block (positions 11-13) has the middle position (12) replaced with 8. The third block (16-18) has the last position (18) replaced with 8. So the 8s are placed at the first, middle, and last positions of each block. That seems like a possible pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize that? For example, if a block of 2s is present, then the 8s are placed at the first, middle, and last positions of each block. But how to detect those blocks.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first row, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. These positions are 6 units from the left, which is the middle of the first third of the row. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like the middle of the grid. For example, in the first row, the middle of the grid is position 9 (since 19 elements, 0-based, middle is 9). But the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18, which are not the middle.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 2. The input has 2s, 0s, and 3s. The output has 8s, 2s, and 0s. For example, the first row of input is 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 3 3. The output is 8 2 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 0 0. So the 3s are replaced with 0s, and the 2s are replaced with 8s in certain positions. For example, the first cell is 2 in input, becomes 8 in output. The second cell is 2, becomes 2. The fifth cell is 2, becomes 2. The sixth cell is 2, becomes 8. So why is the first and sixth positions replaced with 8s?\n\nIn the input for Example 2, the first row has 2s at positions 0, 1, 4, 5. The output has 8s at positions 0 and 5. So maybe the 8s are placed at the ends of the blocks of 2s. For example, the first block of 2s is positions 0-1. The output replaces the first position (0) with 8. The next block of 2s is positions 4-5. The output replaces the first position (4) with 2 and the second (5) with 8. So the 8 is at the end of the block.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. How to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in certain positions relative to the edges. For example, in the first row of Example 2, the first 2 is at position 0 (left edge), and the sixth 2 is at position 5 (which is the end of the block). So maybe the 8s are placed at the ends of the blocks of 2s.\n\nBut how to detect blocks of 2s. For example, in the input, the 2s are in contiguous blocks. So perhaps the transformation is to replace the first and last elements of each block of 2s with 8s.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's test it against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row of input has three blocks of 2s. The first block is positions 6-8 (length 3). The first element of this block is position 6. According to the hypothesis, this would be replaced with 8. But in the output, position 6 is 8. Then the last element of this block is position 8, which is replaced with 2. But in the output, position 8 is 2. So that doesn't fit. However, the second block is positions 11-13. The first element is 11, which is 2 in input. In the output, position 11 is 2. The last element is 13, which is 8. So that fits. The third block is positions 16-18. The first element is 16 (2), which is 2 in output. The last element is 18 (2), which is 8 in output. So this fits. So for the first block, the first element is replaced with 8, and the last element is 2. But why?\n\nThis seems inconsistent. So perhaps the hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in certain positions, like the middle of the block. For example, in the first block of 3 2s, the middle is position 7. In the output, that position is 2. But in the output, position 6 is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of certain lines. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. These positions are spaced 6 units apart. But 6 is 19/3.3... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of a diagonal. For example, in the first row, position 6 is part of a diagonal. But I don't see a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like the middle of the grid. For example, the middle of the grid is at position 9 (for a 19x19 grid). But the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original 2s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like the positions that are in the same row as the 3s. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is all 3s. The output for that row is all 0s. So maybe the 3s are being replaced with 0s, and the 2s in the same row are replaced with 8s? But that doesn't fit. Because in the fifth row of the input, the 3s are all 3s, but the output is all 0s. But the input for the fifth row is all 3s, and the output is all 0s. So maybe the 3s are replaced with 0s. But in other rows, like the sixth row of the input, which is all 3s, the output has some 2s and 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being replaced with 0s, and the 2s are being replaced with 8s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row of 3s, which is replaced with 0s. But the sixth row of the input is all 3s, and the output has some 2s and 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 2s and 3s. The output has 8s and 2s. For example, the first row of input is 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3. The output is 8 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 8. So the 3s are replaced with 0s and 2s. The first cell is 2 in input, becomes 8. The last cell is 3, becomes 8. So maybe the 3s are replaced with 0s, but some positions are replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position. For example, in Example 3, the first row of input has 2s at positions 0 and 2. The output has 8 at position 0 and 2 at position 2. So the first 2 is replaced with 8, but the second 2 is kept. So why?\n\nMaybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is part of a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a certain position relative to the edges. For instance, in the first row of Example 3, the 2 at position 0 is at the left edge. Maybe that's why it's replaced with 8. But the 2 at position 2 is in the middle, so it's kept. But how to generalize that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is part of a certain shape, like a cross or a line. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the 2s are in blocks. The 8s are placed at the ends of those blocks.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows:\n\n- The 3s are replaced with 0s.\n- The 2s are replaced with 8s in certain positions, like the edges or certain patterns.\n- The 0s are kept as is.\n\nBut how to determine which 2s are replaced with 8s.\n\nLooking at the first example, the 3s are replaced with 0s in certain rows. For example, the fifth row of input is all 3s, and the output is all 0s. The sixth row of input is all 3s, and the output has some 2s and 0s. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the 3s are replaced with 0s only in certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are replaced with 0s in rows where there are certain patterns. For example, if a row is all 3s, then replace them with 0s. But in the sixth row of Example 1, the input is all 3s, and the output has some 2s and 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are part of certain lines. For example, in the first row, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. These are positions that are multiples of 6. 6, 12, 18 are all multiples of 6. But 6 is 19/3.333... Not sure. Alternatively, these positions are spaced 6 units apart. Maybe this is a pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize this. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. These are the positions that are 6 units from the left edge, 12 units from the left edge, and 18 units from the left edge. But for a 19x19 grid, these positions are in the middle of the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed at positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in the first row, the middle is position 9. But the 8s are at 6, 12, 18. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed at positions that are part of a certain pattern, like the positions that are in the same column as the 3s. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is all 3s. The output for that row is all 0s. So maybe the columns where 3s appear are replaced with 0s. But that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 8s if they are in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, or if it's part of a certain pattern. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position relative to the 3s. For example, if the cell is adjacent to a 3, it's replaced with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position relative to the edges. For example, if the cell is in the first third of the row, replace it with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to think of the transformation as replacing 2s with 8s in certain positions, and 3s with 0s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 8s where the cell is in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in the first third of the row, or the second third, or the third third.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is part of a certain shape. For example, in the first example, the 2s are in blocks, and the 8s are placed at the ends of those blocks.\n\nSo, the code could look for blocks of 2s and replace the first and last elements of each block with 8s. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, the blocks are 6-8, 11-13, 16-18. The first element of each block is 6, 11, 16. The last element is 8, 13, 18. According to the hypothesis, the first element of each block is replaced with 8. So in the first block, position 6 becomes 8. In the second block, position 11 becomes 8. In the third block, position 16 becomes 8. But in the output, position 11 is 2, and position 16 is 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in the output of the first row of Example 1, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. So position 12 is the middle of the second block (positions 11-13). So maybe the middle of the block is replaced with 8.\n\nIn the first block (6-8), the middle is 7. But in the output, position 7 is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Perhaps I should look for other patterns.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are part of certain lines. For example, in the first row, the 8s are at positions 6, 12, 18. These are positions that are 6 units apart. In a 19x19 grid, 6 is 19/3.333... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in the same column as a certain pattern. For example, in the first column of the input, the first row is 0, second row is 0, third row is 0, fourth row is 0, fifth row is 3, sixth row is 3, seventh row is 3, etc. So maybe the columns with 3s are replaced with 0s. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position relative to the 3s. For example, if the cell is in the same row as a 3, it's replaced with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, perhaps I should try to code a transformation that replaces 2s with 8s in certain positions and 3s with 0s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the 3s are replaced with 0s. So in the code, any cell with 3 is replaced with 0.\n\nFor the 2s, perhaps replace them with 8s if they are in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in the first third of the row or the third third, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position relative to the edges. For example, if the cell is in the first third of the row, replace it with 8.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the cell is in a certain pattern, like the middle of the grid. For example, in a 19x19 grid, the middle is at row 9, column 9. So cells that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 8s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the cell is part of a certain pattern, like the middle of a block of 2s.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for the following:\n\nIn all examples, the output has 8s where the input had 2s, but in certain positions. So maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position relative to the 3s. For example, in the first example, the 3s are in the fifth row. The output for that row is all 0s. So maybe the 3s are replaced with 0s, and the 2s in the same row are replaced with 8s. But in the sixth row of the input, which is all 3s, the output has some 2s and 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a row that has a 3, then it's replaced with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let's try to code a transformation that replaces 3s with 0s, and replaces 2s with 8s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in the middle of the grid. For example, for a 19x19 grid, the middle is at (9,9). So cells that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 8s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position, like the first third of the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in the same column as a 3.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the 3s are replaced with 0s, and the 2s are replaced with 8s in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the 2s in the first row are replaced with 8s at certain positions.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the code can replace 3s with 0s, and for 2s, replace them with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the first third of the row.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 2s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the middle of the row or column.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in the same row as a 3. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is all 3s. The output for that row is all 0s. So the 2s in other rows are replaced with 8s if they are in the same row as a 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll try to write code that replaces 3s with 0s, and replaces 2s with 8s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine those positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain position, like the middle of the grid.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for the number of 8s in the output. In Example 1, there are several 8s. In Example 2, there are 8s in certain positions. In Example 3, there are 8s in certain positions.\n\nMaybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain pattern, like a diagonal.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll have to proceed with a possible transformation that replaces 3s with 0s, and replaces 2s with 8s in certain positions.\n\nFor example, replace 3s with 0s, and replace 2s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nMaybe the code can iterate over each cell and check if it is 2, and if it is in the middle of the grid, replace it with 8.\n\nBut for a 19x19 grid, the middle is at row 9, column 9. So cells in row 9 and column 9 are replaced with 8s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, replace 2s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the first third of the row.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write code that replaces 3s with 0s, and replaces 2s with 8s in certain positions, like the middle of the grid.\n\nBut this is likely not correct, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Replace 3s with 0s\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    # Replace 2s with 8s in certain positions\n    # For example, replace 2s in the middle of the grid\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2 and (i == 9 or j == 9):\n                transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. In Example 1, the middle of the grid is at (9,9). But in the output of Example 1, there are 8s in various positions, not just the middle. So this code would not work for Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe replace 2s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the first third of the row.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in the same row as a 3. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row has 3s. The output for that row is all 0s. So the 2s in other rows are replaced with 8s if they are in the same row as a 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll try to write code that replaces 3s with 0s, and replaces 2s with 8s if they are in the same row as a 3.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Replace 3s with 0s\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    # Replace 2s with 8s if they are in the same row as a 3\n    for i in range(19):\n        has_3 = False\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                has_3 = True\n                break\n        if has_3:\n            for j in range(19):\n                if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nThis code replaces 3s with 0s, and replaces 2s with 8s in any row that has a 3. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the fifth row is all 3s. So any 2 in that row is replaced with 8. But in the fifth row of the input, the row is all 3s, so no 2s. So this would not affect it. The sixth row of input is all 3s, so any 2 in that row is replaced with 8. But the input for the sixth row is all 3s, so no 2s. So this would not affect it. But in the output of Example 1, the sixth row has 2s and 0s. So this code would not work.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are part of certain patterns. For example, the first row has 8s at positions 6, 12, 18. These are positions that are 6 units from the left, 12 units from the left, and 18 units from the left. These are positions that are multiples of 6. So maybe the 8s are placed at positions where the column is a multiple of 6.\n\nBut for a 19x19 grid, 6, 12, 18 are multiples of 6. So perhaps the code replaces 2s with 8s if their column is a multiple of 6.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, the 2s are at columns 6, 11, 16. The columns 6, 12, 18 are multiples of 6. So in the first row, the 2 at column 6 is replaced with 8. The 2 at column 11 is not a multiple of 6, so it remains 2. The 2 at column 16 is not a multiple of 6, so it remains 2. But in the output, the 2 at column 12 is replaced with 8. But 12 is a multiple of 6. So this suggests that the code replaces 2s with 8s if their column is a multiple of 6.\n\nBut in the first row, the 2 at column 6 is replaced with 8. The 2 at column 12 is replaced with 8. The 2 at column 18 is replaced with 8. So this fits.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row has 2s at columns 6, 11, 16. The output replaces 6, 12, 18 with 8. But 12 is not a column where there is a 2 in the input. Wait, in the first row of input, the 2s are at columns 6, 11, 16. So the 12th column is 0 in the input. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nThe transformation replaces 3s with 0s, and replaces 2s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the middle of the grid or certain columns.\n\nBut since I can't determine the exact pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8s are placed at positions that are in certain columns. For example, in the first row, the 8s are at columns 6, 12, 18. These are columns that are 6, 12, 18. So for a 19x19 grid, these are columns 6, 12, 18. So perhaps the code replaces 2s with 8s if their column is 6, 12, or 18.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Replace 3s with 0s\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    # Replace 2s with 8s in certain columns\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2 and j in [6, 12, 18]:\n                transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would only replace 2s in columns 6, 12, 18, which may not fit all examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the first row of input is 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 3 3. The output is 8 2 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2s at columns 0 and 1 are replaced with 8 and 2. The 2 at column 5 is replaced with 8. So in this case, the columns 0, 1, 5 are replaced. But according to the code above, columns 6, 12, 18 are the only ones replaced. So this code would not work for Example 2.\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the examples.\n\nMaybe the 8s are placed where the original cell is 2 and is in the same row as a 3.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nIn Example 1, the fifth row is all 3s. So any 2 in that row is replaced with 8. But in the fifth row of the input, there are no 2s, so this would not affect it. In the sixth row of the input, which is all 3s, there are no 2s, so no replacement. But in the output of Example 1, the sixth row has some 2s and 0s. So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess that the transformation is to replace 3s with 0s, and replace 2s with 8s in certain positions, like the middle of the grid or certain columns.\n\nBut since I can't determine the exact pattern, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 3s with 0s and replaces 2s with 8s in certain positions, like the middle of the grid.\n\nFinal code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Replace 3s with 0s\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    # Replace 2s with 8s in the middle of the grid\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2 and (i == 9 or j == 9):\n                transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nThis is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n"
