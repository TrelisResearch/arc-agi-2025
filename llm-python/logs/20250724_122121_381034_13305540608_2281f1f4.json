All 5s remain unchanged\n2. For every row that contains at least one 5 in the input (excluding row 0), 2s are placed in the same column positions where 5s appear in row 0\n3. The 2s appear in rows that originally had 5s (except row 0)\n\nLet me refine this:\n- Row 0 remains unchanged\n- For every other row that originally contains 5s, we place 2s in the column positions where row 0 has 5s\n\nLet me verify with Example 1:\n- Row 0 has 5s at columns 0, 3, 7\n- Rows 3 and 7 have 5s originally\n- So rows 3 and 7 get 2s at columns 0, 3, 7\n\nThis matches!\n\nExample 2:\n- Row 0 has 5s at columns 1, 3, 4, 7\n- Rows 2, 4, 7 have 5s originally\n- So rows 2, 4, 7 get 2s at columns 1, 3, 4, 7\n\nThis matches!\n\nExample 3:\n- Row 0 has 5s at columns 2, 3, 5, 7, 8\n- Rows 2, 3, 6, 8 have 5s originally\n- So rows 2, 3, 6, 8 get 2s at columns 2, 3, 5, 7, 8\n\nThis matches!\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find columns in row 0 that have value 5\n    row_0_five_columns = []\n    for col in range(len(grid[0])):\n        if grid[0][col] == 5:\n            row_0_five_columns.append(col)\n    \n    # For each row (except row 0), if the row originally had any 5s,\n    # place 2s in the columns where row 0 has 5s\n    for row in range(1, len(grid)):\n        # Check if this row originally had any 5s\n        originally_had_fives = 5 in grid[row]\n        \n        if originally_had_fives:\n            # Place 2s in the columns where row 0 has 5s\n            for col in row_0_five_columns:\n                # Only place 2 if the position is currently 0 (empty)\n                if result[row][col] == 0:\n                    result[row][col] = 2\n    \n    return result\n```",

The first row (row 0) remains unchanged\n2. 5s in other rows are being replaced by 2s in specific rows\n3. The rows where replacements happen appear to be rows that contain 5s in the input, but not the first occurrence\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- It seems like for each column that has 5s, we're replacing 5s with 2s in all rows except the first row where that column's 5 appears.\n\nLet me recheck:\nExample 1:\n- Column 0: 5 at row 0 \u2192 no replacement in row 0\n- Column 3: 5 at row 0 \u2192 no replacement in row 0  \n- Column 7: 5 at row 0 \u2192 no replacement in row 0\n- Column 9: 5s at rows 3, 7 \u2192 replace with 2s in rows 3, 7\n\nExample 2:\n- Column 1: 5 at row 0 \u2192 no replacement in row 0\n- Column 3: 5 at row 0 \u2192 no replacement in row 0\n- Column 4: 5 at row 0 \u2192 no replacement in row 0\n- Column 7: 5 at row 0 \u2192 no replacement in row 0\n- Column 9: 5s at rows 2, 4, 7 \u2192 replace with 2s in rows 2, 4, 7\n\nThis looks right! The pattern is:\n1. Find all columns that contain 5s\n2. For each such column, find all rows (except the first) where there's a 5\n3. Replace those 5s with 2s\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each column, check if it contains any 5s\n    for col in range(10):\n        # Find all rows in this column that contain 5\n        rows_with_five = []\n        for row in range(10):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5:\n                rows_with_five.append(row)\n        \n        # If there are multiple 5s in this column, replace all except the first one with 2s\n        if len(rows_with_five) > 1:\n            # Replace all 5s with 2s except the first occurrence\n            for row in rows_with_five[1:]:\n                result[row][col] = 2\n    \n    return result\n```",
