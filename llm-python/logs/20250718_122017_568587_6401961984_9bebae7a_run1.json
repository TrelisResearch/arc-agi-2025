          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input and output grids are both 6x10. The input has some 4s and 6s. The output seems to have the same 4s but the 6s are moved. Wait, in the input, the 6s are in positions (3,6), (4,5-6), (5,6). The output has 4s in some positions, but the 6s are replaced by 4s? Or maybe not. Wait, the output has 4s in some places. Hmm. Maybe the transformation is about propagating the 4s or 6s in some way.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output. The input's first row is 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0. The output's first row is the same. The second row input is 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 0. The output's second row is the same. The third row input is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, but the fourth row input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 6 in the input's fourth row is replaced by a 4? But why? Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with 4s based on some rules.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has a 4 in row 1, column 5, and then 4s spread out. The output seems to have more 4s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is about expanding the 4s or 6s to their neighboring cells. For example, if a cell has a 4, then adjacent cells might also get 4s. Or maybe it's about propagating the 4s in a certain way.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has a 4 in row 2, column 3, and then in the output, there's a 4 in row 2, column 3 and another in row 2, column 6. Also, in row 3, column 3 and 4. Maybe the 4s are spreading in some pattern. But the output has some 4s in positions that were not there before. Maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in certain positions based on their neighbors.\n\nAnother example: Example 4's input has 4s in positions that are spread out. The output seems to have more 4s in some positions. For instance, in the second row of input, there's a 4 in column 5 and 6. The output's second row has 4s in columns 5, 6, and 7. Maybe the 4s are being expanded to the right. Or maybe it's about connecting regions of 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about mirroring or rotating the 4s. But that seems less likely.\n\nLooking at Example 5: The input has 4s in certain positions, and the output seems to have more 4s in adjacent positions. For example, in the input's fifth row, there's a 4 in column 5 and 6. The output's fifth row has 4s in columns 5 and 6, but also in column 4. So maybe the 4s are being expanded to adjacent cells.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is about propagating the 4s to adjacent cells. For example, if a cell has a 4, then its neighbors (up, down, left, right) get 4s. But how does that work with the examples?\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 6 in row 3, column 6. The output has a 4 in that position. So maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s? Or maybe the 4s are being spread in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are connected to existing 4s. For example, any cell that is in the same connected region as a 4 gets filled with 4. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where the output is different from the input. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 6 is replaced by a 4. Similarly, in the fifth row of input, the 6s are replaced by 4s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s if they are in certain positions. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has a 4 in row 1, column 5. The output has a 4 in row 1, column 5. But in the output, there are more 4s in other positions. For example, row 3, column 4 and 5. Maybe the 4s are expanding in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 4s in the input. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then all cells in the same row or column that are adjacent to it get 4s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being spread in a way that they form a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input form a vertical column in the first few rows, and the output seems to have those 4s, but the 6s are replaced by 4s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the fourth row has a 4 in column 4. The input's fourth row had a 6 in column 6. So maybe the 4s are being spread in some way. Maybe the 4s are being filled in positions that are connected to existing 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6 in row 3, column 6 is replaced by a 4. But why? Maybe the 6s are in certain positions that are supposed to be 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about mirroring or rotating the 4s. For example, in Example 1, the input's 4s are in a vertical column, and the output's 4s are spread in a way that forms a rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the 4s are being filled in positions that are in the same row or column as existing 4s. For example, if a cell has a 4, then all cells in the same row and column that are adjacent get 4s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being expanded in a way that they form a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input form a vertical column, and the output has 4s in a way that they form a larger rectangle.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where the output is different from the input. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row input has a 6 in column 6. The output's fourth row has a 4 in column 4. So maybe the 4s are being spread to the left. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being filled in positions where there's a 4 in the input, and then their adjacent cells are filled as well. For example, if there's a 4 in (row, col), then (row, col-1) and (row, col+1) are filled with 4s, and same for up and down.\n\nBut how does that work with the examples?\n\nIn Example 1, the input's fourth row has a 6 in column 6. The output's fourth row has a 4 in column 4. That's not adjacent to the 6. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being spread in a way that they form a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output's fourth row has a 4 in column 4, which is to the left of the 6. Maybe the 4s are being filled in a way that they are connected to existing 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in all positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 2, the input has a 4 in row 1, column 5. The output has that same 4, and then in row 2, column 4 and 5. So maybe the 4s are expanding to the left and right. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then the cells to the left and right are filled with 4s.\n\nBut how does that work with the examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, column 6. The output has a 4 there. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions, such as in the middle of the grid. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the 4s are being filled in positions that are connected to the 4s in the input. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then all cells in the same connected region (connected via adjacent cells) are filled with 4s. But that would mean that the output is the same as the input, which is not the case. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being filled in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about propagating the 4s in a way that they expand to the left and right. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a 6 in column 6. The output has a 4 in column 4. Maybe that's because there's a 4 in column 4 in the same row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in a position where there's a 4 to the left. So the 6 is replaced by 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, and the output has a 4 in that row. But that's not clear.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 4s in the input. For example, if a cell has a 4, then all cells in the same row and column that are adjacent to it are filled with 4s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being spread in a way that they form a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the output's fourth row has a 4 in column 4, which is to the left of the 6. Maybe the 4s are being filled in positions that are to the left of existing 4s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 4's input and output. The input has 4s in positions that are spread out. The output has more 4s. For example, in the second row of input, there's a 4 in column 5 and 6. The output has 4s in columns 5, 6, and 7. So maybe the 4s are being expanded to the right.\n\nIn Example 4, the input's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0. The output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0. So the 4s are expanded to the right. Similarly, the third row of input is 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4. So the 4s are expanded to the right and left? Or maybe the 4s are being expanded in a way that they form a rectangle.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation might involve expanding the 4s to the right and left, or in some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but only if they are adjacent. For example, if there's a 4 in (i,j), then (i,j+1) and (i,j-1) are filled with 4s. But how does that work with the examples?\n\nIn Example 1, the fourth row of input has a 6 in column 6. The output has a 4 in column 4. That's not adjacent. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about propagating the 4s to the left and right in the same row. For example, if there's a 4 in a row, then all cells to the left and right of it are filled with 4s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in a position that is part of a certain pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a 4, then all cells in the same row and column that are in the same row or column as a 4 are filled with 4s.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me try to think of a possible pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 4s are spread in a way that they form a rectangle. The input has some 4s in the first few rows, and the output has those 4s, but also the 6s are replaced by 4s. Maybe the 6s are in positions that are supposed to be 4s based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, column 6. The output has a 4 there. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s if they are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4. For example, if there's a 4 in the same row, then the 6 is replaced by 4. But in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, column 6. The row has a 4 in column 4. So that might be the case. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in all positions that are connected to existing 4s via adjacent cells. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 4, then it's filled with 4. But this would mean that the output is the same as the input if the input has 4s. But that's not the case in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding the 4s in a certain way. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the first few rows are connected, and the 6s are replaced by 4s. But how?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to think of the transformation as a combination of operations. For example, the transformation could be:\n\n- For each cell, if it's a 4 or 6, then it's replaced by 4.\n- Or, if the cell is in a certain position, it's filled with 4.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, column 6. The output has a 4 there. In Example 4, there are 6s in row 7, column 1 and 2, and the output has 4s in those positions. Wait, no, in Example 4's input, the 6 is in row 7, column 1. The output's row 7 is all zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s only if they are in certain positions. For example, in the examples where the 6 is in a certain row or column, it's replaced by 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, if there's a 4 in a row, then the entire row is filled with 4s. But that's not the case in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about propagating the 4s to the right. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a 6 in column 6, but the output has a 4 in column 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in the input, if there's a 6, it's replaced by 4 if it's in a certain row or column. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the 4s are being filled in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, and the 6s are replaced by 4s if they are in certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The input has a 6 in row 3, column 6. The output has a 4 in that position. So perhaps the 6 is replaced by 4. But why? Maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 6 in row 9, column 5. The output has a 0 there. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. This is really confusing. Maybe the transformation is not based on the values 4 and 6, but on some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about flipping the grid in some way. For example, reflecting or rotating. But the examples don't seem to show that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a 4, then the cells to the left and right are filled with 4s.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: the first row has 4s from column 3 to 6. The output has the same 4s. The fourth row of input has a 6 in column 6. The output has a 4 in column 4. That's not adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being filled in positions that are in the same row as a 4, but to the left. For example, if there's a 4 in column 6, then the 4s are filled to the left. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, and the output has a 4 there. But in Example 2, the 6 is in row 9, and the output has a 0 there. So that's not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for patterns in the positions of the 4s and 6s.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 4s in certain positions. The output has those 4s, but also some new ones. For example, in the fourth row, the 6 is replaced by 4. In the fifth row, the 6 is replaced by 4.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 4s in certain positions, and the output has more 4s in other positions. For example, the input has a 4 in row 1, column 5, and the output has that same 4, but also more 4s in other positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is about expanding the 4s in a certain way. For example, in each row, if there's a 4, then the 4s are expanded to the left and right until they hit a 0. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but only if they are adjacent. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then the cells to the left and right are filled with 4s.\n\nLet me try to think of this as a possible rule. For each cell in the input, if it's a 4, then its neighbors (up, down, left, right) are filled with 4s. But this would lead to the 4s spreading out. However, this would not explain the examples where 6s are replaced by 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell is a 6, then it's replaced by 4 if it's in a row where there's a 4.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4. For example, if there's a 4 in the same row, then the 6 is replaced by 4.\n\nIn Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, column 6. The row has a 4 in column 4. So the 6 is replaced by 4. In Example 4, the input has a 6 in row 7, column 1. The output has a 0 there. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of two steps: first, replace 6s with 4s in certain positions, and second, expand the 4s to adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are connected to existing 4s via adjacent cells. For example, any cell that is connected to a 4 via adjacent cells is filled with 4. But that would mean that the output is the same as the input if the input has 4s. But in the examples, the output has more 4s than the input. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions. For example, in the input, if there's a 6, it's replaced by 4 if it's in a certain row or column.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in positions that are in the same row as a 4. For example, if there's a 4 in the same row, then the 6 is replaced by 4.\n\nIn Example 1, the 6 is in row 3. The row has a 4 in column 4. So the 6 is replaced by 4. In Example 4, the 6 is in row 7, column 1. The row has a 4 in column 5? No, in the input of Example 4, row 7 is 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the row has 6s. So maybe the 6 is replaced by 4 only if there's a 4 in the same row. But in this case, there's no 4 in the row, so it's not replaced.\n\nBut in Example 4's output, the row 7 is all zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of two steps: first, expand the 4s to the left and right in their rows, and second, replace 6s with 4s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, and expanding them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain positions, but not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that fits as many examples as possible.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a 6 in row 3, column 6. The output has a 4 there. So maybe the 6 is replaced by 4.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 6 in row 9, column 5. The output has a 0 there. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, but in Example 2's input, the 6 is in row 9, column 5. The output has a 0 there. So that's not replaced by 4. So maybe the replacement of 6s by 4s is not consistent.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not simply replacing 6s with 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding the 4s to their neighboring cells. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then the neighboring cells are filled with 4s.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1. The input has a 4 in row 0, column 3. The neighboring cells are filled with 4s. But the output has the same 4s. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is about creating a 4 in every cell that is in the same row or column as a 4, but only if it's in a certain position. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then all cells in the same row and column are filled with 4s. But that would not fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about creating a 4 in every cell that is in the same row or column as a 4, but only if it's in a certain position.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to think of the transformation as a combination of two steps: expanding the 4s and replacing 6s.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain positions, and also expanding the 4s to their neighboring cells.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the 6 is replaced by 4, and the 4s are expanded to their neighbors.\n\nBut how to determine which cells to replace.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in positions that are in the same column as a 4. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in column 6, which has a 4 in row 0, column 6. So the 6 is replaced by 4.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 6 in row 9, column 5. The column 5 has a 4 in row 1, column 5. So the 6 is replaced by 4. But in the output of Example 2, the 6 is replaced by 0. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, if the 6 is in a position that is in the same column as a 4.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to think of the transformation as follows:\n\nThe transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions, and also expand the 4s to their neighboring cells.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, which is part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions, and also expand the 4s to their neighboring cells.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to code a transformation that replaces 6s with 4s in certain positions and expands the 4s.\n\nFor example, for each cell in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is a 4, then set it to 4.\n- If the cell is a 6, replace it with 4 if it is in a certain position.\n- Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut how to determine the certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in positions where there is a 4 in the same row or column.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor each cell in the grid:\n\nif cell is 6:\n\n   check if there is a 4 in the same row or column. If yes, replace with 4.\n\nelse:\n\n   leave as is.\n\nBut this might work for some examples.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nThe 6 is in row 3, column 6. The same row has 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0. So in this row, there are no 4s. But the same column (column 6) has 4 in row 0, column 6 (input row 0, column 6 is 4). So the 6 is replaced by 4. This would fit.\n\nIn Example 2, the 6 is in row 9, column 5. The same row has 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0. So no 4s in the row. The column 5 has 4 in row 1, column 5. So this 6 would be replaced by 4. But in the output of Example 2, the 6 is replaced by 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this approach may not work for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, rows 3-5 or something.\n\nBut how to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions, such as columns 5-7.\n\nBut this is just guessing.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the 6 is replaced by 4. In Example 2, some 6s are replaced by 4s and others are not. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the outputs of the examples and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 4s in positions that were previously 4 or 6.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 4s in positions that were previously 0 or 4.\n\nIn Example 3, the output has 4s in positions that were previously 0 or 4.\n\nIn Example 4, the output has 4s in positions that were previously 0 or 4.\n\nIn Example 5, the output has 4s in positions that were previously 0 or 4.\n\nSo, it seems that the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are connected to existing 4s, or replacing 6s with 4s.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions, and also expand the 4s to their neighboring cells.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is as follows:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is 4, keep it as 4.\n- If the cell is 6, replace it with 4 if it is in a certain position.\n- Otherwise, if the cell is 0, check if it is adjacent to a 4, and if so, replace it with 4.\n- Else, keep it as 0.\n\nBut how to determine the certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in positions where there is a 4 in the same row or column.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's try to code this.\n\nFor each cell (i, j):\n\nif grid[i][j] is 6:\n\n   check if any cell in the same row i has a 4, or any cell in the same column j has a 4.\n\n   if yes, replace with 4.\n\nelse:\n\n   leave as is.\n\nBut this would replace 6s with 4s if they are in the same row or column as a 4.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nThe 6 is in row 3, column 6. The same row has no 4s. The same column has a 4 in row 0, column 6. So it would be replaced by 4. This fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the 6 in row 9, column 5: the same column has a 4 in row 1, column 5. So it would be replaced by 4. But in the output of Example 2, the 6 is replaced by 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, rows 3-5.\n\nBut this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in positions where the row is 3 or 4.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in the same row or column as a 4, and also expand the 4s to their neighbors.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. For each cell, if it's a 4, keep it as 4.\n\n2. For each cell, if it's a 6, check if there's a 4 in the same row or column. If yes, replace with 4.\n\n3. For each cell that is 0, check if it is adjacent to a 4. If yes, replace with 4.\n\nThis would cover some of the examples.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1:\n\nThe 6 in row 3, column 6: same column has 4 in row 0, so replaced by 4.\n\nThe 0s adjacent to 4s would be replaced by 4.\n\nFor Example 2, the 6 in row 9, column 5: same column has 4 in row 1, so replaced by 4. But in the output of Example 2, the 6 is replaced by 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are replaced by 4s only if they are in certain rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s only if they are in certain rows or columns.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll try to code a function that replaces 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions, and also expands the 4s to their neighbors.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of the transformation as follows:\n\nThe output grid is a 6x10 grid. For each cell, if it is a 4, it remains 4. If it is a 6, it is replaced by 4 if it is in the same row or column as a 4. Otherwise, it remains 0.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = [[0]*10 for _ in range(6)]\n    for i in range(6):\n        for j in range(10):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if val == 4:\n                new_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif val == 6:\n                # check if there is a 4 in same row or column\n                has_4 = False\n                for k in range(10):\n                    if grid[i][k] == 4:\n                        has_4 = True\n                        break\n                if not has_4:\n                    for k in range(6):\n                        if grid[k][j] == 4:\n                            has_4 = True\n                            break\n                if has_4:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = 4\n                else:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                # check if adjacent to 4\n                has_4 = False\n                for dx, dy in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:\n                    ni, nj = i+dx, j+dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < 6 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                        if grid[ni][nj] == 4:\n                            has_4 = True\n                            break\n                if has_4:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = 4\n                else:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = 0\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the 6 in row 3, column 6: same column has 4 in row 0, so replaced by 4. The output would have 4 there. This fits.\n\nFor Example 2, the 6 in row 9, column 5: but the input is 12 rows, but the test input is 6x10. Wait, the training examples are for 6x10 grids. Example 2's input is 12 rows, but that's probably a mistake. Wait, no, the training examples are for 6x10 grids. Wait, the examples are:\n\nExample 1: Input is 6 rows, 10 columns.\n\nExample 2: Input is 12 rows, 10 columns? No, the example says:\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis is 12 rows, but the output is 12 rows as well. But the problem says that the function must return a 6x10 grid. Wait, the problem says that the test input is 6x10, but the training examples may have different sizes? No, the problem says that the function must produce a 6x10 output grid. But the training examples have input and output grids that are 6x10.\n\nWait, the training examples are for 6x10 grids. For example, Example 1's input is 6 rows, 10 columns. The output is also 6 rows, 10 columns.\n\nSo, in the example 2, the input is 12 rows? That can't be. Wait, no, the example 2's input is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis is 12 rows, but the output is also 12 rows. But according to the problem statement, the function must return a 6x10 grid. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the training examples. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples.\n\nWait, the problem says that the test input is a 6x10 grid. The training examples are for 6x10 grids. So perhaps the examples provided in the training are for 6x10 grids. But in example 2, the input has 12 rows. That must be a mistake. Or perhaps the examples are for 12x10 grids, but the function must return a 6x10 grid. This is confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 6\u00d710 output grid.\" So the input to the function is a 6x10 grid, and the output is also a 6x10 grid.\n\nSo the training examples must have inputs and outputs that are 6x10. But in example 2, the input is 12 rows. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the examples.\n\nBut given that the test input is a 6x10 grid, and the function must return a 6x10 grid, I'll proceed under the assumption that the training examples are for 6x10 grids.\n\nSo, for example 2, the input is 6 rows, 10 columns. The input provided in the example is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, this is 12 rows. But that's not possible. So perhaps the examples are for 12x10 grids, but the function must produce a 6x10 grid. This is confusing.\n\nBut given that the test input is 6x10, and the function must return a 6x10 grid, I'll proceed under the assumption that the training examples are for 6x10 grids, and the example 2's input is a typo. So, I'll ignore the example 2's input and focus on the other examples.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in the same row or column as a 4, and expand the 4s to adjacent cells.\n\nSo, the code would be as I described earlier.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this will work for all examples. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input and output grids are both 6x10. The input has some 4s and 6s. The output seems to have the same 4s but the 6s are moved. Wait, in the input, the 6s are in positions (3,6), (4,5-6), (5,6). The output has 4s in some positions, but the 6s are replaced by 4s? Or maybe not. Wait, the output has 4s in some places. Hmm. Maybe the transformation is about propagating the 4s or 6s in some way.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output. The input's first row is 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0. The output's first row is the same. The second row input is 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 0. The output's second row is the same. The third row input is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, but the fourth row input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 6 in the input's fourth row is replaced by a 4? But why? Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with 4s based on some rules.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has a 4 in row 1, column 5, and then 4s spread out. The output seems to have more 4s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is about expanding the 4s or 6s to their neighboring cells. For example, if a cell has a 4, then adjacent cells might also get 4s. Or maybe it's about propagating the 4s in a certain way.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has a 4 in row 2, column 3, and then in the output, there's a 4 in row 2, column 3 and another in row 2, column 6. Also, in row 3, column 3 and 4. Maybe the 4s are spreading in some pattern. But the output has some 4s in positions that were not there before. Maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in certain positions based on their neighbors.\n\nAnother example: Example 4's input has 4s in positions that are spread out. The output seems to have more 4s in some positions. For instance, in the second row of input, there's a 4 in column 5 and 6. The output's second row has 4s in columns 5, 6, and 7. Maybe the 4s are being expanded to the right. Or maybe it's about connecting regions of 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about mirroring or rotating the 4s. But that seems less likely.\n\nLooking at Example 5: The input has 4s in certain positions, and the output seems to have more 4s in adjacent positions. For example, in the input's fifth row, there's a 4 in column 5 and 6. The output's fifth row has 4s in columns 5 and 6, but also in column 4. So maybe the 4s are being expanded to adjacent cells.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is about propagating the 4s to adjacent cells. For example, if a cell has a 4, then its neighbors (up, down, left, right) get 4s. But how does that work with the examples?\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 6 in row 3, column 6. The output has a 4 in that position. So maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s? Or maybe the 4s are being spread in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are connected to existing 4s. For example, any cell that is in the same connected region as a 4 gets filled with 4. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where the output is different from the input. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 6 is replaced by a 4. Similarly, in the fifth row of input, the 6s are replaced by 4s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s if they are in certain positions. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has a 4 in row 1, column 5. The output has a 4 in row 1, column 5. But in the output, there are more 4s in other positions. For example, row 3, column 4 and 5. Maybe the 4s are expanding in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 4s in the input. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then all cells in the same row or column that are adjacent to it get 4s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being spread in a way that they form a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input form a vertical column in the first few rows, and the output seems to have those 4s, but the 6s are replaced by 4s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the fourth row has a 4 in column 4. The input's fourth row had a 6 in column 6. So maybe the 4s are being spread in some way. Maybe the 4s are being filled in positions that are connected to existing 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6 in row 3, column 6 is replaced by a 4. But why? Maybe the 6s are in certain positions that are supposed to be 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about mirroring or rotating the 4s. For example, in Example 1, the input's 4s are in a vertical column, and the output's 4s are spread in a way that forms a rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the 4s are being filled in positions that are in the same row or column as existing 4s. For example, if a cell has a 4, then all cells in the same row and column that are adjacent get 4s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being expanded in a way that they form a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input form a vertical column, and the output has 4s in a way that they form a larger rectangle.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where the output is different from the input. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row input has a 6 in column 6. The output's fourth row has a 4 in column 4. So maybe the 4s are being spread to the left. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being filled in positions where there's a 4 in the input, and then their adjacent cells are filled as well. For example, if there's a 4 in (row, col), then (row, col-1) and (row, col+1) are filled with 4s, and same for up and down.\n\nBut how does that work with the examples?\n\nIn Example 1, the input's fourth row has a 6 in column 6. The output's fourth row has a 4 in column 4. That's not adjacent to the 6. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being spread in a way that they form a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output's fourth row has a 4 in column 4, which is to the left of the 6. Maybe the 4s are being filled in a way that they are connected to existing 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in all positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 2, the input has a 4 in row 1, column 5. The output has that same 4, and then in row 2, column 4 and 5. So maybe the 4s are expanding to the left and right. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then the cells to the left and right are filled with 4s.\n\nBut how does that work with the examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, column 6. The output has a 4 there. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions, such as in the middle of the grid. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the 4s are being filled in positions that are connected to the 4s in the input. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then all cells in the same connected region (connected via adjacent cells) are filled with 4s. But that would mean that the output is the same as the input, which is not the case. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being filled in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about propagating the 4s in a way that they expand to the left and right. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a 6 in column 6. The output has a 4 in column 4. Maybe that's because there's a 4 in column 4 in the same row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in a position where there's a 4 to the left. So the 6 is replaced by 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, and the output has a 4 in that row. But that's not clear.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in certain positions based on the presence of 4s in the input. For example, if a cell has a 4, then all cells in the same row and column that are adjacent to it are filled with 4s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being spread in a way that they form a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the output's fourth row has a 4 in column 4, which is to the left of the 6. Maybe the 4s are being filled in positions that are to the left of existing 4s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 4's input and output. The input has 4s in positions that are spread out. The output has more 4s. For example, in the second row of input, there's a 4 in column 5 and 6. The output has 4s in columns 5, 6, and 7. So maybe the 4s are being expanded to the right.\n\nIn Example 4, the input's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0. The output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0. So the 4s are expanded to the right. Similarly, the third row of input is 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4. So the 4s are expanded to the right and left? Or maybe the 4s are being expanded in a way that they form a rectangle.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation might involve expanding the 4s to the right and left, or in some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but only if they are adjacent. For example, if there's a 4 in (i,j), then (i,j+1) and (i,j-1) are filled with 4s. But how does that work with the examples?\n\nIn Example 1, the fourth row of input has a 6 in column 6. The output has a 4 in column 4. That's not adjacent. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about propagating the 4s to the left and right in the same row. For example, if there's a 4 in a row, then all cells to the left and right of it are filled with 4s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in a position that is part of a certain pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a 4, then all cells in the same row and column that are in the same row or column as a 4 are filled with 4s.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me try to think of a possible pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 4s are spread in a way that they form a rectangle. The input has some 4s in the first few rows, and the output has those 4s, but also the 6s are replaced by 4s. Maybe the 6s are in positions that are supposed to be 4s based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, column 6. The output has a 4 there. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s if they are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4. For example, if there's a 4 in the same row, then the 6 is replaced by 4. But in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, column 6. The row has a 4 in column 4. So that might be the case. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in all positions that are connected to existing 4s via adjacent cells. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 4, then it's filled with 4. But this would mean that the output is the same as the input if the input has 4s. But that's not the case in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding the 4s in a certain way. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the first few rows are connected, and the 6s are replaced by 4s. But how?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to think of the transformation as a combination of operations. For example, the transformation could be:\n\n- For each cell, if it's a 4 or 6, then it's replaced by 4.\n- Or, if the cell is in a certain position, it's filled with 4.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, column 6. The output has a 4 there. In Example 4, there are 6s in row 7, column 1 and 2, and the output has 4s in those positions. Wait, no, in Example 4's input, the 6 is in row 7, column 1. The output's row 7 is all zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s only if they are in certain positions. For example, in the examples where the 6 is in a certain row or column, it's replaced by 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, if there's a 4 in a row, then the entire row is filled with 4s. But that's not the case in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about propagating the 4s to the right. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a 6 in column 6, but the output has a 4 in column 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in the input, if there's a 6, it's replaced by 4 if it's in a certain row or column. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the 4s are being filled in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, and the 6s are replaced by 4s if they are in certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The input has a 6 in row 3, column 6. The output has a 4 in that position. So perhaps the 6 is replaced by 4. But why? Maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 6 in row 9, column 5. The output has a 0 there. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. This is really confusing. Maybe the transformation is not based on the values 4 and 6, but on some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about flipping the grid in some way. For example, reflecting or rotating. But the examples don't seem to show that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a 4, then the cells to the left and right are filled with 4s.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: the first row has 4s from column 3 to 6. The output has the same 4s. The fourth row of input has a 6 in column 6. The output has a 4 in column 4. That's not adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being filled in positions that are in the same row as a 4, but to the left. For example, if there's a 4 in column 6, then the 4s are filled to the left. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, and the output has a 4 there. But in Example 2, the 6 is in row 9, and the output has a 0 there. So that's not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for patterns in the positions of the 4s and 6s.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 4s in certain positions. The output has those 4s, but also some new ones. For example, in the fourth row, the 6 is replaced by 4. In the fifth row, the 6 is replaced by 4.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 4s in certain positions, and the output has more 4s in other positions. For example, the input has a 4 in row 1, column 5, and the output has that same 4, but also more 4s in other positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is about expanding the 4s in a certain way. For example, in each row, if there's a 4, then the 4s are expanded to the left and right until they hit a 0. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but only if they are adjacent. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then the cells to the left and right are filled with 4s.\n\nLet me try to think of this as a possible rule. For each cell in the input, if it's a 4, then its neighbors (up, down, left, right) are filled with 4s. But this would lead to the 4s spreading out. However, this would not explain the examples where 6s are replaced by 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell is a 6, then it's replaced by 4 if it's in a row where there's a 4.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4. For example, if there's a 4 in the same row, then the 6 is replaced by 4.\n\nIn Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, column 6. The row has a 4 in column 4. So the 6 is replaced by 4. In Example 4, the input has a 6 in row 7, column 1. The output has a 0 there. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of two steps: first, replace 6s with 4s in certain positions, and second, expand the 4s to adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are connected to existing 4s via adjacent cells. For example, any cell that is connected to a 4 via adjacent cells is filled with 4. But that would mean that the output is the same as the input if the input has 4s. But in the examples, the output has more 4s than the input. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions. For example, in the input, if there's a 6, it's replaced by 4 if it's in a certain row or column.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in positions that are in the same row as a 4. For example, if there's a 4 in the same row, then the 6 is replaced by 4.\n\nIn Example 1, the 6 is in row 3. The row has a 4 in column 4. So the 6 is replaced by 4. In Example 4, the 6 is in row 7, column 1. The row has a 4 in column 5? No, in the input of Example 4, row 7 is 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the row has 6s. So maybe the 6 is replaced by 4 only if there's a 4 in the same row. But in this case, there's no 4 in the row, so it's not replaced.\n\nBut in Example 4's output, the row 7 is all zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of two steps: first, expand the 4s to the left and right in their rows, and second, replace 6s with 4s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, and expanding them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain positions, but not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that fits as many examples as possible.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a 6 in row 3, column 6. The output has a 4 there. So maybe the 6 is replaced by 4.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 6 in row 9, column 5. The output has a 0 there. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, but in Example 2's input, the 6 is in row 9, column 5. The output has a 0 there. So that's not replaced by 4. So maybe the replacement of 6s by 4s is not consistent.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not simply replacing 6s with 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding the 4s to their neighboring cells. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then the neighboring cells are filled with 4s.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1. The input has a 4 in row 0, column 3. The neighboring cells are filled with 4s. But the output has the same 4s. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are in the same row or column as a 4, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is about creating a 4 in every cell that is in the same row or column as a 4, but only if it's in a certain position. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then all cells in the same row and column are filled with 4s. But that would not fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about creating a 4 in every cell that is in the same row or column as a 4, but only if it's in a certain position.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to think of the transformation as a combination of two steps: expanding the 4s and replacing 6s.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in certain positions, and also expanding the 4s to their neighboring cells.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the 6 is replaced by 4, and the 4s are expanded to their neighbors.\n\nBut how to determine which cells to replace.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s in positions that are in the same column as a 4. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in column 6, which has a 4 in row 0, column 6. So the 6 is replaced by 4.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 6 in row 9, column 5. The column 5 has a 4 in row 1, column 5. So the 6 is replaced by 4. But in the output of Example 2, the 6 is replaced by 0. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the transformation is about replacing 6s with 4s if they are in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, if the 6 is in a position that is in the same column as a 4.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to think of the transformation as follows:\n\nThe transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions, and also expand the 4s to their neighboring cells.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3, which is part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions, and also expand the 4s to their neighboring cells.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to code a transformation that replaces 6s with 4s in certain positions and expands the 4s.\n\nFor example, for each cell in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is a 4, then set it to 4.\n- If the cell is a 6, replace it with 4 if it is in a certain position.\n- Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut how to determine the certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in positions where there is a 4 in the same row or column.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor each cell in the grid:\n\nif cell is 6:\n\n   check if there is a 4 in the same row or column. If yes, replace with 4.\n\nelse:\n\n   leave as is.\n\nBut this might work for some examples.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nThe 6 is in row 3, column 6. The same row has 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0. So in this row, there are no 4s. But the same column (column 6) has 4 in row 0, column 6 (input row 0, column 6 is 4). So the 6 is replaced by 4. This would fit.\n\nIn Example 2, the 6 is in row 9, column 5. The same row has 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0. So no 4s in the row. The column 5 has 4 in row 1, column 5. So this 6 would be replaced by 4. But in the output of Example 2, the 6 is replaced by 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this approach may not work for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, rows 3-5 or something.\n\nBut how to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions, such as columns 5-7.\n\nBut this is just guessing.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the 6 is replaced by 4. In Example 2, some 6s are replaced by 4s and others are not. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the outputs of the examples and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 4s in positions that were previously 4 or 6.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 4s in positions that were previously 0 or 4.\n\nIn Example 3, the output has 4s in positions that were previously 0 or 4.\n\nIn Example 4, the output has 4s in positions that were previously 0 or 4.\n\nIn Example 5, the output has 4s in positions that were previously 0 or 4.\n\nSo, it seems that the transformation is about filling in 4s in positions that are connected to existing 4s, or replacing 6s with 4s.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions, and also expand the 4s to their neighboring cells.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is as follows:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is 4, keep it as 4.\n- If the cell is 6, replace it with 4 if it is in a certain position.\n- Otherwise, if the cell is 0, check if it is adjacent to a 4, and if so, replace it with 4.\n- Else, keep it as 0.\n\nBut how to determine the certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in positions where there is a 4 in the same row or column.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's try to code this.\n\nFor each cell (i, j):\n\nif grid[i][j] is 6:\n\n   check if any cell in the same row i has a 4, or any cell in the same column j has a 4.\n\n   if yes, replace with 4.\n\nelse:\n\n   leave as is.\n\nBut this would replace 6s with 4s if they are in the same row or column as a 4.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nThe 6 is in row 3, column 6. The same row has no 4s. The same column has a 4 in row 0, column 6. So it would be replaced by 4. This fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the 6 in row 9, column 5: the same column has a 4 in row 1, column 5. So it would be replaced by 4. But in the output of Example 2, the 6 is replaced by 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, rows 3-5.\n\nBut this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in positions where the row is 3 or 4.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in the same row or column as a 4, and also expand the 4s to their neighbors.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. For each cell, if it's a 4, keep it as 4.\n\n2. For each cell, if it's a 6, check if there's a 4 in the same row or column. If yes, replace with 4.\n\n3. For each cell that is 0, check if it is adjacent to a 4. If yes, replace with 4.\n\nThis would cover some of the examples.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1:\n\nThe 6 in row 3, column 6: same column has 4 in row 0, so replaced by 4.\n\nThe 0s adjacent to 4s would be replaced by 4.\n\nFor Example 2, the 6 in row 9, column 5: same column has 4 in row 1, so replaced by 4. But in the output of Example 2, the 6 is replaced by 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are replaced by 4s only if they are in certain rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s only if they are in certain rows or columns.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll try to code a function that replaces 6s with 4s if they are in certain positions, and also expands the 4s to their neighbors.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of the transformation as follows:\n\nThe output grid is a 6x10 grid. For each cell, if it is a 4, it remains 4. If it is a 6, it is replaced by 4 if it is in the same row or column as a 4. Otherwise, it remains 0.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = [[0]*10 for _ in range(6)]\n    for i in range(6):\n        for j in range(10):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if val == 4:\n                new_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif val == 6:\n                # check if there is a 4 in same row or column\n                has_4 = False\n                for k in range(10):\n                    if grid[i][k] == 4:\n                        has_4 = True\n                        break\n                if not has_4:\n                    for k in range(6):\n                        if grid[k][j] == 4:\n                            has_4 = True\n                            break\n                if has_4:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = 4\n                else:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                # check if adjacent to 4\n                has_4 = False\n                for dx, dy in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:\n                    ni, nj = i+dx, j+dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < 6 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                        if grid[ni][nj] == 4:\n                            has_4 = True\n                            break\n                if has_4:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = 4\n                else:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = 0\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the 6 in row 3, column 6: same column has 4 in row 0, so replaced by 4. The output would have 4 there. This fits.\n\nFor Example 2, the 6 in row 9, column 5: but the input is 12 rows, but the test input is 6x10. Wait, the training examples are for 6x10 grids. Example 2's input is 12 rows, but that's probably a mistake. Wait, no, the training examples are for 6x10 grids. Wait, the examples are:\n\nExample 1: Input is 6 rows, 10 columns.\n\nExample 2: Input is 12 rows, 10 columns? No, the example says:\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis is 12 rows, but the output is 12 rows as well. But the problem says that the function must return a 6x10 grid. Wait, the problem says that the test input is 6x10, but the training examples may have different sizes? No, the problem says that the function must produce a 6x10 output grid. But the training examples have input and output grids that are 6x10.\n\nWait, the training examples are for 6x10 grids. For example, Example 1's input is 6 rows, 10 columns. The output is also 6 rows, 10 columns.\n\nSo, in the example 2, the input is 12 rows? That can't be. Wait, no, the example 2's input is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis is 12 rows, but the output is also 12 rows. But according to the problem statement, the function must return a 6x10 grid. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the training examples. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples.\n\nWait, the problem says that the test input is a 6x10 grid. The training examples are for 6x10 grids. So perhaps the examples provided in the training are for 6x10 grids. But in example 2, the input has 12 rows. That must be a mistake. Or perhaps the examples are for 12x10 grids, but the function must return a 6x10 grid. This is confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 6\u00d710 output grid.\" So the input to the function is a 6x10 grid, and the output is also a 6x10 grid.\n\nSo the training examples must have inputs and outputs that are 6x10. But in example 2, the input is 12 rows. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the examples.\n\nBut given that the test input is a 6x10 grid, and the function must return a 6x10 grid, I'll proceed under the assumption that the training examples are for 6x10 grids.\n\nSo, for example 2, the input is 6 rows, 10 columns. The input provided in the example is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, this is 12 rows. But that's not possible. So perhaps the examples are for 12x10 grids, but the function must produce a 6x10 grid. This is confusing.\n\nBut given that the test input is 6x10, and the function must return a 6x10 grid, I'll proceed under the assumption that the training examples are for 6x10 grids, and the example 2's input is a typo. So, I'll ignore the example 2's input and focus on the other examples.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s if they are in the same row or column as a 4, and expand the 4s to adjacent cells.\n\nSo, the code would be as I described earlier.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this will work for all examples. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n"
