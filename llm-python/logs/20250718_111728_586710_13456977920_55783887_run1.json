It seems like the transformation involves spreading values in a way that they propagate outward from their original positions, possibly in a diagonal or wave-like pattern.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that:\n- The value 1 in Example 1 spreads diagonally to the right and down\n- The value 6 in Example 2 spreads in a wave-like pattern\n- The value 1 in Example 3 spreads in a diagonal pattern\n- The value 6 in Example 4 spreads in a more complex wave-like pattern\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading values in a wave-like pattern from their original positions, possibly in a diagonal or spiral pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(9):\n            # If the cell is not 0, spread it to adjacent cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for k in range(j+1, 9):\n                    if transformed_grid[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[i][k] = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread down\n                for k in range(i+1, 9):\n                    if transformed_grid[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[k][j] = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread diagonally down-right\n                for k in range(1, 9):\n                    if i + k < 9 and j + k < 9:\n                        if transformed_grid[i + k][j + k] == 0:\n                            transformed_grid[i + k][j + k] = grid[i][j]\n                        else:\n                            break\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(9):\n            # If the cell is not 0, spread it to adjacent cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for k in range(j+1, 9):\n                    if transformed_grid[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[i][k] = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread down\n                for k in range(i+1, 9):\n                    if transformed_grid[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[k][j] = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread diagonally down-right\n                for k in range(1, 9):\n                    if i + k < 9 and j + k < 9:\n                        if transformed_grid[i + k][j + k] == 0:\n                            transformed_grid[i + k][j + k] = grid[i][j]\n                        else:\n                            break\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe that the transformation involves spreading or propagating certain values (like 1, 4, 6) in a specific pattern. It seems like the transformation involves spreading values in a way that they propagate outward from their original positions, possibly in a diagonal or wave-like pattern.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that:\n- The value 1 in Example 1 spreads diagonally to the right and down\n- The value 6 in Example 2 spreads in a wave-like pattern\n- The value 1 in Example 3 spreads in a diagonal pattern\n- The value 6 in Example 4 spreads in a more complex wave-like pattern\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading values in a wave-like pattern from their original positions, possibly in a diagonal or spiral pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(9):\n            # If the cell is not 0, spread it to adjacent cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for k in range(j+1, 9):\n                    if transformed_grid[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[i][k] = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread down\n                for k in range(i+1, 9):\n                    if transformed_grid[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[k][j] = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread diagonally down-right\n                for k in range(1, 9):\n                    if i + k < 9 and j + k < 9:\n                        if transformed_grid[i + k][j + k] == 0:\n                            transformed_grid[i + k][j + k] = grid[i][j]\n                        else:\n                            break\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(9):\n            # If the cell is not 0, spread it to adjacent cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for k in range(j+1, 9):\n                    if transformed_grid[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[i][k] = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread down\n                for k in range(i+1, 9):\n                    if transformed_grid[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[k][j] = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread diagonally down-right\n                for k in range(1, 9):\n                    if i + k < 9 and j + k < 9:\n                        if transformed_grid[i + k][j + k] == 0:\n                            transformed_grid[i + k][j + k] = grid[i][j]\n                        else:\n                            break\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
