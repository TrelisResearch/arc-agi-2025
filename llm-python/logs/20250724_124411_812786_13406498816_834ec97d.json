          "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to identify the pattern.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input: 3x3 grid with a '2' at position (0,1)\n- Output: 3x3 grid with a '4' at position (0,1) and (1,1), and the original '2' at (1,1) becomes '2'\n\nWait, let me recheck this:\n- Input: 0 2 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0\n- Output: 0 4 0, 0 2 0, 0 0 0\n\nActually, it looks like:\n- The '2' at (0,1) gets a '4' above it at (0,1) (but that's the same position - that can't be right)\n- Let me look more carefully...\n\nLooking at Example 1 again:\nInput:\n```\n0 2 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n0 4 0\n0 2 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nI see! The '2' at position (0,1) remains, and a '4' appears at position (0,0) and (0,2) in the same row, but that's not right either.\n\nLet me re-examine:\n- Input: '2' at (0,1) \n- Output: '4' at (0,1), '2' at (1,1)\n\nNo, that's not it either. Let me read the positions correctly:\n- Input: '2' at row 0, column 1\n- Output: '4' at row 0, column 1 and '2' at row 1, column 1\n\nHmm, that would mean '4' replaces '2'? No, let me be more systematic.\n\nActually:\n- Input: position [0][1] = 2\n- Output: position [0][1] = 4, position [1][1] = 2\n\nSo the 2 moves down one row and a 4 appears in its original position.\n\nLet me check Example 2:\nInput: 5x5 grid with '6' at (2,2)\nOutput: 5x5 grid with a pattern of 4s and the '6' stays in place at (4,2) - wait no, '6' is at (2,2) in input and (4,2) in output.\n\nActually, '6' at (2,2) moves to (4,2) and there's a pattern of 4s filling rows 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nLet me check Example 3:\nInput: 9x9 grid with '9' at (4,2)  \nOutput: 9x9 grid with '9' at (5,2) and a pattern of 4s.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\nInput '9' at (4,2) -> Output '9' at (5,2)? No, output shows '9' still at (4,2).\n\nActually looking more carefully:\n- The non-zero element stays in the same position\n- But there's a pattern of 4s above it\n\nIn Example 2:\n- '6' at (2,2) stays at (2,2)\n- There's a pattern of 4s in rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 at columns 0, 2, 4\n\nIn Example 3:\n- '9' at (4,2) stays at (4,2) \n- There's a pattern of 4s in rows 0-4 at odd positions\n\nLet me look for a different pattern.\n\nActually, let me re-read the requirement: \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nAh! I see the issue. I need to produce a 3x3 grid regardless of input size.\n\nLooking again:\nExample 1: 3x3 input -> 3x3 output (matches)\nExample 2: 5x5 input -> but I need to produce 3x3 output\nExample 3: 9x9 input -> but I need to produce 3x3 output\n\nSo I need to somehow extract or transform the input to always produce a 3x3 output.\n\nLet me re-analyze with this in mind:\n\nExample 1: 3x3 -> 3x3, clear.\n\nExample 2: 5x5 input with '6' at (2,2) -> 3x3 output with pattern:\n```\n4 0 4\n4 0 4  \n4 0 4\n```\nand original non-zero element somehow represented?\n\nWait, the output is actually 5x5. Let me re-read...\n\nThe output grids shown are 5x5 and 9x9 respectively. But the requirement says \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nThis is confusing. Let me assume the shown outputs are what we want to replicate, but somehow extract a 3x3 pattern.\n\nActually, re-reading more carefully - the instruction is to implement the transformation that maps inputs to outputs as shown. The constraint about 3x3 might be for the final test function, but the examples show larger grids.\n\nLet me assume I should implement the pattern I see, and then for the test case, extract a 3x3 portion or apply the same logic.\n\nPattern observation:\n1. The non-zero element stays in place (mostly)\n2. A pattern of '4's appears, often in a grid-like fashion above or around the element\n3. The '4's seem to appear at positions with both even row and even column indices (0-indexed), or in a checkerboard pattern\n\nLet me look more systematically:\n\nExample 2: '6' at (2,2). Output has 4s at positions where both row<=3 and (row%2==0 and col%2==0).\n\nActually, looking at output:\nRows 0,1,2,3 have 4 at cols 0,2,4. Row 4 has 6 at col 2.\n\nExample 3: '9' at (4,2). Output has 4s at rows 0-4, cols 0,2,4,6,8 for rows 0-4, then row 5 onwards are mostly 0s except the 9 at (4,2).\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Non-zero elements remain in their positions\n2. '4's fill in a pattern - looks like they appear at positions (r,c) where r < row_of_nonzero_element+1 and both r and c are even\n3. Actually, let me refine: 4s appear in a grid pattern in rows above and including the row with the non-zero element, but only up to a certain point\n\nLet me try a simpler hypothesis:\n1. Find the non-zero element(s)\n2. Place 4s in a checkerboard pattern in the rows leading up to and including the row with the non-zero element\n3. Keep the non-zero elements in place\n\nActually wait - looking at example 1:\nInput: '2' at (0,1)\nOutput: '4' at (0,1) and '2' at (1,1)  \n\nThis looks like the 2 moved down and a 4 appeared where it was.\n\nLet me try a different approach for all examples:\n\nExample 1: '2' moves from (0,1) to (1,1), '4' appears at (0,1)\nExample 2: '6' stays at (2,2), but 4s appear in a pattern  \nExample 3: '9' stays at (4,2), but 4s appear in a pattern\n\nThese are inconsistent. Let me look for a different pattern.\n\nWhat if:\n- The transformation creates a 3x3 grid centered around or derived from the input?\n- Or takes a 3x3 section of the input?\n\nBut that doesn't match the examples.\n\nLet me re-read the instruction: \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nI think this means my function should return a 3x3 grid regardless of the input size.\n\nSo I need to find the pattern that, when applied, results in a 3x3 grid.\n\nLet me hypothesize that I should:\n1. Find significant elements in the input\n2. Create a 3x3 pattern based on those elements\n\nLooking at the examples again to extract 3x3 patterns:\n\nIf I take the central 3x3 region or create a summary 3x3 grid:\n\nActually, let me just implement what I see and then ensure it outputs 3x3:\n\nPattern seems to be:\n1. Keep non-zero elements\n2. Add '4' in specific patterns - often like a grid or frame\n\nLet me make my best guess:\n\nThe transformation appears to:\n1. Preserve non-zero elements in their positions (within a 3x3 view?)\n2. Add '4' elements in a pattern - possibly at even-even coordinates\n3. But always produce exactly 3x3 output\n\nFor a large grid, maybe I take a 3x3 window or create a 3x3 summary.\n\nMy hypothesis:\n- Create a 3x3 output",

There's always one non-zero number in the input\n2. The output creates a pattern of \"4\"s above the position of the non-zero number\n3. The non-zero number stays in its original position\n4. The pattern of 4s seems to be a checkerboard or grid pattern\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- In example 1: The \"4\"s form what looks like the beginning of a checkerboard pattern starting from the top\n- In examples 2 and 3: There's a full 5-row pattern of alternating 4s and 0s at the top\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Looking at the output dimensions:\n- The problem statement says \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nThis means regardless of input size, we need to produce a 3\u00d73 output. Let me re-analyze with this in mind.\n\nLooking at example 1: Already 3\u00d73 \u2192 3\u00d73\nExamples 2 and 3: Larger grids \u2192 but we need to produce 3\u00d73 outputs.\n\nSo the transformation should take any grid and produce a 3\u00d73 result.\n\nLet me look for what determines the 3\u00d73 output:\n- Example 1: The \"2\" at (0,1) becomes a pattern where \"4\"s appear at (0,1) and the \"2\" moves to (1,1)\n- But wait, that's not right either - the output shows \"4\" at (0,1) and \"2\" at (1,1)\n\nLet me re-read more carefully...\n\nActually, the output shows:\n- Position (0,1) has \"4\" (was \"2\" in input)\n- Position (1,1) has \"2\" (was \"0\" in input)\n\nSo it seems like the non-zero value gets replaced with \"4\" at its position, and then that value appears one position down.\n\nLet me check this hypothesis:\nExample 1: \"2\" at (0,1) \u2192 \"4\" at (0,1) and \"2\" at (1,1)\nExample 2: \"6\" at (2,2) \u2192 pattern of \"4\"s in top rows and \"6\" stays at (2,2)\nExample 3: \"9\" at (4,2) \u2192 pattern of \"4\"s in top rows and \"9\" stays at (4,2)\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood the requirement. Let me re-read...\n\nThe requirement is: \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nThis means we need to extract or derive a 3\u00d73 grid from any input. \n\nLooking at this again:\n- Maybe we're supposed to center on the non-zero element and extract a 3\u00d73 region?\n- Or create a canonical 3\u00d73 pattern based on the input?\n\nLet me look at where the non-zero elements are and what 3\u00d73 region around them would look like:\n\nExample 1: Non-zero at (0,1) - can't center, so take top-left 3\u00d73\nExample 2: Non-zero at (2,2) - center at (2,2) and take 3\u00d73 region around it\nExample 3: Non-zero at (4,2) - center at (4,2) and take 3\u00d73 region around it\n\nBut that doesn't match the outputs either.\n\nLet me reconsider what the actual pattern is for producing a 3\u00d73 output:\n\nWhat if the rule is:\n1. Find the non-zero element\n2. Create a 3\u00d73 grid with a checkerboard pattern of 4s in upper rows\n3. Place the original element in its relative position\n\nActually, let me just implement what seems to be the core pattern based on the examples:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the non-zero element\n    non_zero_val = 0\n    non_zero_row = -1\n    non_zero_col = -1\n    \n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[i])):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                non_zero_val = grid[i][j]\n                non_zero_row = i\n                non_zero_col = j\n                break\n        if non_zero_val != 0:\n            break\n    \n    # Create 3x3 output grid\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Fill with checkerboard pattern of 4s in top rows\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if i < 2 and (i + j) % 2 == 0:  # First two rows, checkerboard pattern\n                result[i][j] = 4\n    \n    # Place the non-zero element if it would be in the 3x3 view\n    # This is a simplified approach - in the examples it seems to be placed in corresponding position\n    if non_zero_val != 0:\n        # Place the original value (this is a simplification based on pattern observation)\n        if non_zero_row < len(grid) and non_zero_col < len(grid[0]):\n            # Map the position to our 3x3 grid - simple mapping for now\n            result[min(2, non_zero_row)][min(2, non_zero_col)] = non_zero_val\n            \n            # Based on example 1, also place a 4 at the same position\n            if non_zero_row < 3 and non_zero_col < 3:\n                result[non_zero_row][non_zero_col] = 4\n                # And place original value one row down if possible\n                if non_zero_row + 1 < 3:\n                    result[non_zero_row + 1][non_zero_col] = non_zero_val\n    \n    return result\n```",

Find the row with the non-zero element\n2. Fill all rows above that row (and possibly that row) with a checkerboard pattern of '4' and '0'\n3. Preserve the original non-zero element in its position\n\nActually, let me re-examine Example 1 more carefully:\nInput:\n```\n0 2 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n0 4 0\n0 2 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nThe '2' moved from (0,1) to (1,1), and a '4' appeared at (0,1). No, that's not right either.\n\nLet me look at it differently:\n- The non-zero element stays in place\n- A pattern of '4's is generated in positions above and around the non-zero element\n\nActually, looking at Example 1 again:\n- Input: '2' at (0,1) \n- Output: '4' at (0,1), '2' at (0,1) becomes... No, that's not making sense.\n\nWait, let me recheck the coordinates:\nRow 0: 0 2 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0  \nRow 2: 0 0 0\n\nSo '2' is at row 0, column 1.\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 0 4 0\nRow 1: 0 2 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0\n\nSo the '4' is at (0,1) and the '2' moved to (1,1). \n\nNo, I think I'm misreading this. Let me look at the exact positions:\nInput: '2' at (0,1)\nOutput: '4' at (0,1) and '2' at (1,1)\n\nThis looks like the value is being \"pushed down\" and a '4' is placed where it was.\n\nBut that doesn't match the other examples well.\n\nLet me reconsider. Maybe the output is always 3x3? But Example 2 shows a 5x5 output.\n\nWait, the instruction says \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\" \n\nSo I need to understand how to extract or transform these examples to 3x3 grids.\n\nLet me re-read... The examples show different sized grids, but I must produce a 3x3 output.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the core pattern around the non-zero element and extract a 3x3 region?\n\nLooking at all examples:\n1. There's one non-zero element\n2. A pattern of '4's appears around it\n3. The pattern seems to be a checkerboard or specific arrangement\n\nLet me try a different interpretation:\n- Find the non-zero element\n- Create a 3x3 pattern around it with '4's in a specific arrangement\n- Return that 3x3 grid\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nThe '2' is at (0,1). If I extract a 3x3 centered on it (padding as needed), I might get the pattern.\n\nActually, let me look at what seems to be the rule:\n- Find the position of the single non-zero element\n- Generate a 3x3 grid with a specific pattern of '4's, preserving the original element's value in its relative position\n\nIn Example 1:\nNon-zero at (0,1) -> Output pattern puts '4' at (0,0) and (0,2), moves original to (1,1)\n\nLet me see if there's a consistent pattern:\n- The non-zero element gets processed\n- '4's are placed in specific positions\n- The result is always a 3x3 grid\n\nI think the approach is:\n1. Find the non-zero element\n2. Create a specific 3x3 pattern based on what that element is and where it was\n3. Return the 3x3 result\n\nLooking at the patterns:\nExample 1 (element '2'): \n```\n0 4 0\n0 2 0  \n0 0 0\n```\n\nExample 2 (element '6'): The instruction says output must be 3x3, so maybe I should look at the 3x3 region around the '6'?\n'6' is at (2,2) in a 5x5 grid. The 3x3 centered on it would be rows 1-3, cols 1-3:\n```\n0 0 0\n0 6 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nBut the full output shows:\n```\n4 0 4 0 4\n4 0 4 0 4\n4 0 4 0 4\n0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nIf I take the 3x3 centered on the '6' position (2,2), I get:\nRows 1-3, Cols 1-3:\n```\n0 0 0\n0 6 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nBut that doesn't match what I should be generating. \n\nLet me re-read the problem. It says to implement the transformation, and that the function should produce a 3x3 output. The training examples might be showing the full transformation, but I need to extract the 3x3 portion.\n\nLooking more carefully at Example 2's output:\n```\n4 0 4 0 4\n4 0 4 0 4\n4 0 4 0 4\n0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nIf I extract the top-left 3x3:\n```\n4 0 4\n4 0 4\n4 0 4\n```\n\nThat looks like a consistent pattern!\n\nExample 3's output top-left 3x3:\n```\n4 0 4\n4 0 4\n4 0 4\n```\n\nExample 1's output is already 3x3:\n```\n0 4 0\n0 2 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nHmm, that doesn't match the checkerboard. Let me look again.\n\nActually, let me focus on the position of the non-zero element and create a pattern around it.\n\nI think the pattern is:\n1. Create a 3x3 grid filled with checkerboard pattern of '4' and '0' starting with '4' at position (0,0)\n2. Place the original non-zero value in a specific position based on where it was in the original grid\n\nBut Example 1 doesn't fit this.\n\nLet me try: \nThe transformation creates a 3x3 pattern where:\n- Positions follow a checkerboard of 4s and 0s \n- But the original non-zero element affects where it appears in the 3x3\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. What if the rule is:\n1. Always create the checkerboard pattern: 4 0 4 / 0 4 0 / 4 0 4  or 4 0 4 / 4 0 4 / 4 0 4\n2. Place the original element value in the position corresponding to its relative location\n\nLooking at outputs:\nExample 1: 0 4 0 / 0 2 0 / 0 0 0 - This has the checkerboard top row 0 4 0, then 0 2 0 (2 is not 4), then 0 0 0\nExample 2 (3x3 extract): 4 0 4 / ",

The pattern is alternating 4s and 0s in a specific arrangement\n\nLooking more closely at the pattern:\nIt looks like a grid of 4s with 0s in between, forming a uniform grid pattern.\n\nLet me check if it's about creating a \"grid\" pattern of 4s above the main element:\n- In example 2: Rows 0-4 have a pattern, row 2 has the anchor\n- In example 3: Rows 0-4 have a pattern, row 4 has the anchor\n\nActually, let me reconsider the size. In example 1, it's only 2 rows that are filled.\n\nLet me think differently:\n- The transformation creates a \"background\" pattern of 4s\n- The original element stays in its position\n- The pattern seems to be in the upper rows\n\nLooking at the output structure:\n- It seems like a 5-row pattern of 4s and 0s is created starting from the top\n- The pattern is: 4 0 4 0 4 (repeated)\n\nThis looks like a grid pattern that fills the top portion.\n\nBut wait, example 1 is 3\u00d73 and the pattern is different.\n\nLet me re-examine example 1:\nInput: 0 2 0 / 0 0 0 / 0 0 0\nOutput: 0 4 0 / 0 2 0 / 0 0 0\n\nThe 2 moved from (0,1) to (1,1) and a 4 appeared at (0,1).\n\nActually, let me read this more carefully:\nPosition (0,1) changed from 2 to 4\nPosition (1,1) changed from 0 to 2\n\nSo the 2 moved down one row and a 4 appeared in its original position.\n\nLet me check if this is the pattern:\n- Find the non-zero element\n- Move it down one row (if possible)\n- Put a 4 in its original position\n\nBut this doesn't match examples 2 and 3 where elements don't move.\n\nLet me look again:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input: 2 at (0,1)  \n- Output: 4 at (0,1), 2 at (1,1)\n\nExample 2:\n- Input: 6 at (2,2)\n- Output: A pattern of 4s fills the top, 6 stays at (2,2)\n\nI think I see it now. The transformation depends on the grid size and position of the element.\n\nLet me try a different approach:\n1. If it's a small grid (3x3) with element near the top: move the element down and put 4 in original spot\n2. If it's a larger grid: create a pattern of 4s in the rows above the element\n\nActually, the instructions say I must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid. That's a crucial constraint I missed.\n\nSo I need to transform any input grid into a 3\u00d73 output grid.\n\nLooking at the examples again with this constraint:\n- Example 1: 3\u00d73 input \u2192 3\u00d73 output (pattern as described)\n- Example 2: 5\u00d75 input \u2192 but I need to produce 3\u00d73 output... \n- Example 3: 9\u00d79 input \u2192 but I need to produce 3\u00d73 output...\n\nWait, that can't be right based on the shown outputs. Let me re-read...\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the problem statement: \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nBut the examples show 5\u00d75 and 9\u00d79 outputs. This seems contradictory.\n\nLet me re-read... The key is in the requirements: \"The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position. Values are integers from 0-9. Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied.\"\n\nAnd: \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nSo regardless of input size, I must return a 3\u00d73 grid.\n\nThis means I need to understand how to map the patterns in the examples to a 3\u00d73 output.\n\nLet me reconsider:\n- Maybe I should look at a 3\u00d73 window around the significant element?\n- Or take the essence of the pattern and express it in 3\u00d73?\n\nLooking at example 1 output (which is already 3\u00d73):\n0 4 0\n0 2 0\n0 0 0\n\nFor example 2: the significant part might be the pattern in a 3\u00d73 region.\n\nLet me think of it this way:\n- Find the non-zero element(s)\n- Create a 3\u00d73 pattern based on the rules observed\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Place 4s in a grid pattern\n2. Place the original element in its relative position\n3. Fill rest with 0s\n\nBut I need to compress the larger examples into 3\u00d73.\n\nMaybe the rule is:\n- Create a 3\u00d73 grid with a checkerboard pattern of 4s in the background\n- Place the significant element appropriately\n\nLooking at example 1 output again:\n0 4 0  -> Row with 4 in center\n0 2 0  -> Row with the element in center  \n0 0 0  -> Empty row\n\nThis looks like:\n- First row: 4 in the same column as the element\n- Second row: the element itself in its column\n- Third row: empty\n\nLet me check if this generalizes:\nIn example 1, element is in column 1, so 4 appears at (0,1) and element at (1,1).\n\nBut I still need to figure out the rule for what part of larger grids to focus on.\n\nMaybe I should focus on the position of the non-zero element and create a 3\u00d73 view around its \"importance\".\n\nLet me try a hypothesis:\n1. Find the position of the main non-zero element\n2. Create a 3\u00d73 output where:\n   - Row 0: 4s in columns where the element would logically project influence\n   - Row 1: The element in its relative column position\n   - Row 2: 0s or continuation of pattern\n\nLooking at all examples, it seems to be about creating a \"grid\" pattern with 4s.\n\nMy best hypothesis:\nCreate a 3\u00d73 grid where:\n- Row 0: Alternating 4s and 0s (4 0 4 pattern)\n- Row 1: Contains the significant element(s) positioned appropriately\n- Row 2: Part of the pattern or 0s\n\nLet me implement based on what seems most consistent:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the non-zero element\n    element_val = 0\n    element_row = -1\n    element_col = -1\n    \n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[i])):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                element_val = grid[i][j]\n                element_row = i\n                element_col = j\n                break\n        if element_val != 0:\n            break\n    \n    # Create 3x3 output grid\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    #",

That doesn't seem right. Let me look more carefully.\n\nActually, looking again:\n- Input: 0 2 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0\n- Output: 0 4 0, 0 2 0, 0 0 0\n\nThe '2' at (0,1) becomes '4' at (0,1), and a '2' appears at (1,1). So it seems like the value is being doubled and placed above, and the original value is shifted down.\n\nLet me check Example 2:\n- Input: 5x5 grid with '6' at (2,2)\n- Output: 5x5 grid with a pattern of '4' values in the top rows, and '6' remains at (2,2)\n\nLooking more carefully at Example 2 output:\nRow 0: 4 0 4 0 4\nRow 1: 4 0 4 0 4\nRow 2: 4 0 4 0 4\nRow 3: 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe pattern seems to be that above the original non-zero element, there's a checkerboard pattern of '4's.\n\nExample 3:\n- Input: 9x9 grid with '9' at (4,2)\n- Output: Checkerboard pattern of '4's in the top 5 rows, '9' at (5,2) (shifted down by 1)\n\nLet me recheck Example 1 with this hypothesis:\n- Input: 3x3 with '2' at (0,1)\n- Output: Should have '4's in row 0? But we have '4' at (0,1) only.\n\nLet me think differently. Let me look at the positions:\n\nExample 1:\n- Non-zero element '2' at (0,1)\n- In output: '4' at (0,1), '2' at (1,1)\n\nExample 2:\n- Non-zero element '6' at (2,2) \n- In output: Checkerboard of '4's in rows 0-2, '6' at (3,2) (shifted down by 1)\n\nExample 3:\n- Non-zero element '9' at (4,2)\n- In output: Checkerboard of '4's in rows 0-4, '9' at (5,2) (shifted down by 1)\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n1. Find the non-zero element and its position\n2. Create a checkerboard pattern of '4's above that position (in all rows from 0 to the row of the element)\n3. Shift the original element down by one row\n4. But the output must be 3x3...\n\nWait, the requirement says \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nSo regardless of input size, we always output a 3x3 grid. This means we need to extract or focus on a 3x3 region.\n\nLooking at the examples again with this constraint:\n\nExample 1: Input 3x3, Output 3x3 - Direct transformation\nExample 2: Input 5x5, Output 3x3 - Need to extract relevant 3x3 portion\nExample 3: Input 9x9, Output 3x3 - Need to extract relevant 3x3 portion\n\nLet me reconsider Example 2 and 3 to see what 3x3 portion is being extracted.\n\nExample 2: The output shows the '6' at (3,2) in a 5x5 grid, but we need to produce 3x3.\nIf we take the central or bottom portion that includes the element and its transformation...\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. Maybe the output 3x3 grid is focused around the non-zero element.\n\nFor Example 2: '6' is at (2,2) in 5x5 grid. If we extract 3x3 centered at (2,2), we get rows 1-3, cols 1-3.\nBut the output pattern suggests rows 0-2 of the pattern are shown.\n\nLet me re-read the examples more carefully.\n\nActually, looking at the output format more carefully:\n\nExample 1: Output is clearly 3x3\nExample 2: Output shows 5 rows, but requirement says must produce 3x3\nExample 3: Output shows 9 rows, but requirement says must produce 3x3\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me assume that the examples are showing the full grid, but the actual task is to produce a 3x3 output.\n\nLet me try to understand what 3x3 output would be produced:\n\nMaybe the 3x3 output is a \"local\" view around the non-zero element.\n\nLet me try a different approach:\n1. Find the non-zero element in the input\n2. Create the pattern around it\n3. Extract or focus on a 3x3 region\n\nLooking at Example 1 again:\nInput: '2' at (0,1) in 3x3 grid\nOutput: '4' at (0,1), '2' at (1,1) - this looks like the element got doubled and shifted\n\nBut Examples 2 and 3 show checkerboard patterns.\n\nLet me hypothesize:\n1. When there's a non-zero element, create a checkerboard of '4's above it\n2. Shift the element down by one position\n3. Extract a 3x3 region that best shows this transformation\n\nBut I need to be more specific about the 3x3 extraction.\n\nLet me assume the 3x3 output represents the area around the transformed element.\n\nLooking at the patterns:\n- The non-zero element gets surrounded by a pattern of '4's in a checkerboard\n- The element itself might get moved or duplicated\n\nLet me try to code a solution based on my best understanding:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the non-zero element\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    non_zero_pos = None\n    non_zero_val = None\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                non_zero_pos = (r, c)\n                non_zero_val = grid[r][c]\n                break\n        if non_zero_pos:\n            break\n    \n    if not non_zero_pos:\n        # No non-zero element found, return zeros\n        return [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n    \n    # Create output 3x3 grid\n    output = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n    \n    # Center the view around the non-zero element\n    # Map the grid position to 3x3 output position\n    center_r, center_c = non_zero_pos[0], non_zero_pos[1]\n    \n    # For simplicity, let's map the element to center of output (1,1)\n    # and create checkerboard pattern around it\n    \n    # Put the element value in center\n    output[1][1] = non_zero_val\n    \n    # Create checkerboard pattern of 4s around it\n    # Check if we should place 4s based on position parity\n    for r in range(3):\n        for c in range(3):\n            # Skip the center position\n            if r == 1 and c == 1:\n                continue\n            # Create checkerboard: place 4 if (r+c) is even\n            if (r + c) % 2 == 0:\n                output[r][c] = 4\n    \n    return output\n```",

The examples show the full transformation, but when I implement it, I should always return a 3\u00d73 grid.\n\nLet me focus on what's happening in the top-left 3\u00d73 section of each example:\n- Example 1: Top-left 3\u00d73 of output is the entire output: [[0,4,0],[0,2,0],[0,0,0]]\n- Example 2: Top-left 3\u00d73 of output is: [[4,0,4],[4,0,4],[4,0,4]]\n- Example 3: Top-left 3\u00d73 of output is: [[4,0,4],[4,0,4],[4,0,4]]\n\nSo the pattern for the 3\u00d73 output seems to be:\n1. If the non-zero element is in the top-left 3\u00d73 region, place it in the corresponding position and create the pattern above it\n2. If the non-zero element is outside the top-left 3\u00d73 region, just create the checkerboard pattern\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. The pattern seems to be:\n- Create a checkerboard of 4s and 0s starting with 4 at position (0,0)\n- If there's a non-zero element in the input that falls within the 3\u00d73 output, place it in the corresponding position\n\nLet me look at the positions:\n- Example 1: Non-zero \"2\" at (0,1) \u2192 output \"2\" at (0,1), but with pattern above? No, that's not right.\n- Example 1: Output has \"4\" at (0,1) and \"2\" at (1,1)\n\nLet me think of it as:\n1. Create a 3\u00d73 checkerboard of 4s and 0s starting with 4 at (0,0)\n2. Find any non-zero elements in the input that would map to positions in our 3\u00d73 output\n3. Place those elements in their corresponding positions in the output\n\nCheckerboard pattern:\n```\n4 0 4\n0 4 0\n4 0 4\n```\n\nFor example 1: Non-zero element \"2\" is at (0,1) in a 3\u00d73 grid, so we place \"2\" at (0,1) in our output, overriding the \"0\" that would be there in the checkerboard.\n\nFor example 2: Non-zero element \"6\" is at (2,2) in a 5\u00d75 grid. In our 3\u00d73 output, position (2,2) would have a \"4\" in the checkerboard, but we replace it with \"6\".\n\nFor example 3: Non-zero element \"9\" is at (4,2) in a 9\u00d79 grid. This position (4,2) is outside our 3\u00d73 output grid, so we just keep the checkerboard pattern.\n\nLet me verify:\n- Example 1: Checkerboard with \"2\" at (0,1) \u2192 [[4,2,4],[0,4,0],[4,0,4]] - No, that's not matching.\n- Output is: [[0,4,0],[0,2,0],[0,0,0]]\n\nLet me try a different interpretation:\nMaybe it's about the relative position of the non-zero element.\n\nLet me start over with a clean approach:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create 3x3 checkerboard pattern starting with 4\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                result[i][j] = 4\n    \n    # Find non-zero elements in the input grid\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Check if any non-zero elements fall within our 3x3 output region\n    for i in range(min(3, rows)):\n        for j in range(min(3, cols)):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                result[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return result\n```",

Looking at the output sizes:\n- All outputs are the same size as their inputs\n- The pattern seems to be:\n  1. Fill with a checkerboard pattern of 4s and 0s in a specific region\n  2. Keep the original number in its position\n\nLet me trace this more systematically:\n- In Example 1: 2 at (0,1) \u2192 4 at (0,1), 2 at (1,1)\n- In Example 2: 6 at (2,2) \u2192 checkerboard pattern in rows 0-1, 6 stays at (2,2)\n- In Example 3: 9 at (4,2) \u2192 checkerboard pattern in rows 0-4, 9 stays at (4,2)\n\nWait, let me recheck Example 1 more carefully:\nInput:\n```\n0 2 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n0 4 0\n0 2 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nSo the '2' becomes '4' at (0,1) and a new '2' appears at (1,1). This looks like the number moves down one position and gets incremented.\n\nLet me check if that's consistent:\n- 2 \u2192 becomes 4, creates 2 below it\n- But this doesn't explain the other examples well.\n\nLet me look at the bigger picture:\n- All examples seem to create a pattern of alternating 4s and 0s\n- The pattern fills the grid in a checkerboard manner starting from the top\n- The original number remains in place\n\nActually, let me read the instructions again - it says \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nThis is key! I need to transform any input grid to a 3\u00d73 output grid.\n\nLooking again:\nExample 1: 3\u00d73 input \u2192 3\u00d73 output (this one already fits)\nExample 2: 5\u00d75 input \u2192 5\u00d75 output (but I should make it 3\u00d73)\nExample 3: 9\u00d79 input \u2192 9\u00d79 output (but I should make it 3\u00d73)\n\nSo I need to understand what 3\u00d73 pattern is being created and apply that rule.\n\nLet me reframe:\n- Extract the key pattern that would fit in a 3\u00d73 grid\n- The pattern seems to be a checkerboard of 4s and 0s with the main number staying in place\n\nFor a 3\u00d73 transformation:\n- Create a checkerboard pattern of 4s and 0s\n- Place the non-zero number(s) from the input in their corresponding positions\n\nLet me try to understand:\nIn Example 1: \n- Input has 2 at (0,1)\n- Output has 4 at (0,1) and 2 at (1,1) \n- This looks like the number is both incremented (2\u21924) and duplicated/moved\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. What if:\n- I'm supposed to create a 3\u00d73 grid with a checkerboard pattern\n- Place significant numbers from the input in appropriate positions\n\nBut wait, the instruction says the function should work on any input grid and produce a 3\u00d73 output.\n\nLet me re-read... No, the examples show different sized outputs, but the requirement is that my function must produce a 3\u00d73 output.\n\nSo I need to understand the core transformation rule that maps any grid to a 3\u00d73 representation.\n\nLooking at the essence:\n1. There's a checkerboard pattern of 4s and 0s\n2. There are specific numbers that get transformed/positioned\n\nLet me hypothesize: \n- Extract the \"main\" non-zero element from the input\n- Create a 3\u00d73 grid with a checkerboard of 4/0 \n- Place the main element appropriately\n\nLooking more carefully at Example 1:\nInput 3\u00d73: [[0,2,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]\nOutput 3\u00d73: [[0,4,0],[0,2,0],[0,0,0]]\n\nPattern: \n- Position (0,1) changed from 2 to 4\n- Position (1,1) got the value 2 (copied from above?)\n  \nLet me see if there's a center-focused pattern:\n- Take the center or key element\n- Build a pattern around it\n\nActually, let me just implement what I think is the core pattern:\n\n1. Find the non-zero element in the input\n2. Create a 3\u00d73 checkerboard of 4s and 0s \n3. Place the non-zero element according to the rule I observe\n\nThe checkerboard pattern seems to be:\n```\n4 0 4\n0 4 0  \n4 0 4\n```\n\nBut that's not exactly right based on examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1 output:\n```\n0 4 0  -> row starts with 0\n0 2 0  -> row starts with 0  \n0 0 0  -> row starts with 0\n```\n\nLooking at Example 2 output (top rows):\n```\n4 0 4  -> row starts with 4\n4 0 4  -> row starts with 4\n```\n\nHmm. Let me think of this as: I need to produce a fixed 3\u00d73 pattern that represents the transformation.\n\nWhat if the rule is:\n1. Create checkerboard pattern in 3\u00d73\n2. Find main number in input \n3. Place it in corresponding position in output\n\nBut I need to be more systematic. Let me just focus on creating a function that outputs a 3\u00d73 grid.\n\nBased on the examples, it seems like:\n- There's a background pattern of 4s and 0s in a checkerboard\n- The main number gets processed in some way\n\nLet me try a hypothesis:\n- Create a 3\u00d73 grid filled with checkerboard pattern of 4/0\n- Find the main element in input and place it transformed in the output\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x3 output grid\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Create checkerboard pattern of 4s and 0s\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                output[i][j] = 4\n            else:\n                output[i][j] = 0\n    \n    # Find the main non-zero element and its position\n    main_value = 0\n    main_row, main_col = 0, 0\n    \n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                main_value = grid[i][j]\n                main_row, main_col = i, j\n                break\n        if main_value != 0:\n            break\n    \n    # Map the position to 3x3 grid coordinates\n    # For simplicity, use modulo or center mapping\n    mapped_row = min(2, main_row) if len(grid) > 3 else main_row\n    mapped_col = min(2, main_col) if len(grid[0]) > 3 else main_col\n    \n    # If the grid is larger, map positions appropriately\n    if len(grid) > 3:\n        # For larger grids, map the relative position\n        # This is a simplification - in examples the",

The '2' at position (0,1) remains, and a '4' appears at position (0,0) and (0,2) in the same row, but that's not right either.\n\nLet me re-examine:\n- Input: '2' at (0,1) \n- Output: '4' at (0,1), '2' at (1,1)\n\nNo, that's not it either. Let me read the positions correctly:\n- Input: '2' at row 0, column 1\n- Output: '4' at row 0, column 1 and '2' at row 1, column 1\n\nHmm, that would mean '4' replaces '2'? No, let me be more systematic.\n\nActually:\n- Input: position [0][1] = 2\n- Output: position [0][1] = 4, position [1][1] = 2\n\nSo the 2 moves down one row and a 4 appears in its original position.\n\nLet me check Example 2:\nInput: 5x5 grid with '6' at (2,2)\nOutput: 5x5 grid with a pattern of 4s and the '6' stays in place at (4,2) - wait no, '6' is at (2,2) in input and (4,2) in output.\n\nActually, '6' at (2,2) moves to (4,2) and there's a pattern of 4s filling rows 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nLet me check Example 3:\nInput: 9x9 grid with '9' at (4,2)  \nOutput: 9x9 grid with '9' at (5,2) and a pattern of 4s.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\nInput '9' at (4,2) -> Output '9' at (5,2)? No, output shows '9' still at (4,2).\n\nActually looking more carefully:\n- The non-zero element stays in the same position\n- But there's a pattern of 4s above it\n\nIn Example 2:\n- '6' at (2,2) stays at (2,2)\n- There's a pattern of 4s in rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 at columns 0, 2, 4\n\nIn Example 3:\n- '9' at (4,2) stays at (4,2) \n- There's a pattern of 4s in rows 0-4 at odd positions\n\nLet me look for a different pattern.\n\nActually, let me re-read the requirement: \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nAh! I see the issue. I need to produce a 3x3 grid regardless of input size.\n\nLooking again:\nExample 1: 3x3 input -> 3x3 output (matches)\nExample 2: 5x5 input -> but I need to produce 3x3 output\nExample 3: 9x9 input -> but I need to produce 3x3 output\n\nSo I need to somehow extract or transform the input to always produce a 3x3 output.\n\nLet me re-analyze with this in mind:\n\nExample 1: 3x3 -> 3x3, clear.\n\nExample 2: 5x5 input with '6' at (2,2) -> 3x3 output with pattern:\n```\n4 0 4\n4 0 4  \n4 0 4\n```\nand original non-zero element somehow represented?\n\nWait, the output is actually 5x5. Let me re-read...\n\nThe output grids shown are 5x5 and 9x9 respectively. But the requirement says \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nThis is confusing. Let me assume the shown outputs are what we want to replicate, but somehow extract a 3x3 pattern.\n\nActually, re-reading more carefully - the instruction is to implement the transformation that maps inputs to outputs as shown. The constraint about 3x3 might be for the final test function, but the examples show larger grids.\n\nLet me assume I should implement the pattern I see, and then for the test case, extract a 3x3 portion or apply the same logic.\n\nPattern observation:\n1. The non-zero element stays in place (mostly)\n2. A pattern of '4's appears, often in a grid-like fashion above or around the element\n3. The '4's seem to appear at positions with both even row and even column indices (0-indexed), or in a checkerboard pattern\n\nLet me look more systematically:\n\nExample 2: '6' at (2,2). Output has 4s at positions where both row<=3 and (row%2==0 and col%2==0).\n\nActually, looking at output:\nRows 0,1,2,3 have 4 at cols 0,2,4. Row 4 has 6 at col 2.\n\nExample 3: '9' at (4,2). Output has 4s at rows 0-4, cols 0,2,4,6,8 for rows 0-4, then row 5 onwards are mostly 0s except the 9 at (4,2).\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Non-zero elements remain in their positions\n2. '4's fill in a pattern - looks like they appear at positions (r,c) where r < row_of_nonzero_element+1 and both r and c are even\n3. Actually, let me refine: 4s appear in a grid pattern in rows above and including the row with the non-zero element, but only up to a certain point\n\nLet me try a simpler hypothesis:\n1. Find the non-zero element(s)\n2. Place 4s in a checkerboard pattern in the rows leading up to and including the row with the non-zero element\n3. Keep the non-zero elements in place\n\nActually wait - looking at example 1:\nInput: '2' at (0,1)\nOutput: '4' at (0,1) and '2' at (1,1)  \n\nThis looks like the 2 moved down and a 4 appeared where it was.\n\nLet me try a different approach for all examples:\n\nExample 1: '2' moves from (0,1) to (1,1), '4' appears at (0,1)\nExample 2: '6' stays at (2,2), but 4s appear in a pattern  \nExample 3: '9' stays at (4,2), but 4s appear in a pattern\n\nThese are inconsistent. Let me look for a different pattern.\n\nWhat if:\n- The transformation creates a 3x3 grid centered around or derived from the input?\n- Or takes a 3x3 section of the input?\n\nBut that doesn't match the examples.\n\nLet me re-read the instruction: \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nI think this means my function should return a 3x3 grid regardless of the input size.\n\nSo I need to find the pattern that, when applied, results in a 3x3 grid.\n\nLet me hypothesize that I should:\n1. Find significant elements in the input\n2. Create a 3x3 pattern based on those elements\n\nLooking at the examples again to extract 3x3 patterns:\n\nIf I take the central 3x3 region or create a summary 3x3 grid:\n\nActually, let me just implement what I see and then ensure it outputs 3x3:\n\nPattern seems to be:\n1. Keep non-zero elements\n2. Add '4' in specific patterns - often like a grid or frame\n\nLet me make my best guess:\n\nThe transformation appears to:\n1. Preserve non-zero elements in their positions (within a 3x3 view?)\n2. Add '4' elements in a pattern - possibly at even-even coordinates\n3. But always produce exactly 3x3 output\n\nFor a large grid, maybe I take a 3x3 window or create a 3x3 summary.\n\nMy hypothesis:\n- Create a 3x3 output",
