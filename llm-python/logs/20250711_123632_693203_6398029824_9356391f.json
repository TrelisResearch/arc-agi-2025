          "From analyzing the training examples:\n\n- The transformations seem to involve creating concentric borders or frames around points or shapes.\n- The first example appears to generate larger square borders with the center points becoming smaller or more structured.\n- The second example extends a small \"centered\" pattern, replicating the shape with different colors, adding borders around the original shape.\n- The test input is a single green pixel, suggesting that the output likely involves producing a square or border around this point.\n\nBased on this pattern:\n\n- When given a single point, the output seems to be a larger, possibly multi-layered square frame, centered around the point.\n- For the training examples, the frames increase in size and include some nested or colored borders.\n\n**Plan for the code:**\n\n- For any input grid:\n  - Find the positions of points or the main shape.\n  - Generate a square border around the position of the existing shape (or point).\n  - The size of the border can be fixed or proportional to the shape's size; since the input is a point, create a small frame around it.\n  - Fill the outer border with a specific value, similar to the coloring in the training.\n- As the test input involves a single point, the output will be a large square border around that point, following the pattern in training images.\n\nThis approach aligns with the observed pattern: expand single points into larger nested squares/borders.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = grid_np.shape\n\n    # Identify the location of the main point (assume highest value only, or first occurrence)\n    points = np.argwhere(grid_np > 0)\n\n    if len(points) == 0:\n        # No points found, return a blank 16x16 grid\n        return [[0]*16 for _ in range(16)]\n    \n    # For the test, assume only one point or process all to find a central point\n    # For simplicity, take the first point as center\n    center_r, center_c = points[0]\n    \n    # Initialize output grid with zeros\n    out_grid = np.zeros((16, 16), dtype=int)\n\n    # Define border width\n    border_width = 3  # as in examples, larger around the point\n\n    # Calculate border coordinates\n    top = max(0, center_r - border_width)\n    bottom = min(15, center_r + border_width)\n    left = max(0, center_c - border_width)\n    right = min(15, center_c + border_width)\n\n    # Fill the border with value 8 to mimic example borders\n    out_grid[top:bottom+1, left] = 8\n    out_grid[top:bottom+1, right] = 8\n    out_grid[top, left:right+1] = 8\n    out_grid[bottom, left:right+1] = 8\n\n    # Place the original point\n    out_grid[center_r, center_c] = 3  # use 3 as a representative color\n\n    # Optional: add inner patterns (like a smaller square or nested borders)\n    # For simplicity, this example just creates one border around the point\n\n    return out_grid.tolist()\n```"
