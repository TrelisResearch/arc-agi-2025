          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice the following patterns:\n\n1. In Example 1, the 7s in the diagonal of the input grid are transformed into 7s in the diagonal of the output grid, but with additional 7s in the diagonal positions that are offset by one row and column.\n2. In Example 2, the 9s and 5s form a diagonal pattern that gets transformed into a pattern where the values propagate along the diagonal in a specific way.\n3. In Example 3, the 2s and 5s form a diagonal pattern that gets transformed into a pattern where the values propagate along the diagonal in a specific way.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves propagating values along the diagonal in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not zero, propagate the value along the diagonal\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Propagate the value along the diagonal\n                for k in range(1, 10):\n                    if i + k < 10 and j + k < 10:\n                        transformed_grid[i + k][j + k] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not zero, propagate the value along the diagonal\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Propagate the value along the diagonal\n                for k in range(1, 10):\n                    if i + k < 10 and j + k < 10:\n                        transformed_grid[i + k][j + k] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation involves:\n1. Placing the value 7 in the diagonal positions (main diagonal)\n2. For Example 1, the 7s are placed on the main diagonal and some additional positions\n3. For Example 2, the 9s are placed in a diagonal pattern\n4. For Example 3, the 2s are placed in a diagonal pattern with some additional positions\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves placing values in a diagonal pattern, with some additional positions depending on the value.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Place the value 7 on the main diagonal\n    for i in range(10):\n        transformed_grid[i][i] = 7\n    \n    #

In Example 1, the 7s in the diagonal of the input grid are transformed into 7s in the diagonal of the output grid, but with additional 7s in the diagonal positions that are offset by one row and column.\n2. In Example 2, the 9s and 5s form a diagonal pattern that gets transformed into a pattern where the values propagate along the diagonal in a specific way.\n3. In Example 3, the 2s and 5s form a diagonal pattern that gets transformed into a pattern where the values propagate along the diagonal in a specific way.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves propagating values along the diagonal in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not zero, propagate the value along the diagonal\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Propagate the value along the diagonal\n                for k in range(1, 10):\n                    if i + k < 10 and j + k < 10:\n                        transformed_grid[i + k][j + k] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not zero, propagate the value along the diagonal\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Propagate the value along the diagonal\n                for k in range(1, 10):\n                    if i + k < 10 and j + k < 10:\n                        transformed_grid[i + k][j + k] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
