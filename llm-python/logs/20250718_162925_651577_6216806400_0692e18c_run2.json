          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output grids seem to be formed by expanding the input grid in some way. The output grids are 9x9, while the input grids are 3x3. This suggests that the input grid is being expanded to form the output grid.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput:\n0 7 0\n7 7 7\n0 7 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0\n7 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 7\n0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0\n\nIt seems that the input grid is being replicated in a pattern that forms a 9x9 grid. The input grid's values are being placed in a specific pattern that creates a larger grid.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nInput:\n0 0 6\n0 6 0\n6 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6\n0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis example shows a more complex pattern where the input values are being replicated in a way that creates a larger grid with specific patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\nInput:\n4 4 0\n0 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nOutput:\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0\n4 4 0 4 4 0 0 0 0\n4 4 0 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0\n\nThis example shows a pattern where the input values are being replicated in a way that creates a larger grid with specific patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replicating the input grid in a specific pattern to form a 9x9 output grid. The exact pattern is not clear, but I'll implement a transformation that replicates the input grid in a way that forms a 9x9 grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Replicate the input grid in a specific pattern to form the output grid\n    # This is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the training examples\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            # Place the value in the output grid in a specific pattern\n            # This is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the training examples\n            transformed_grid[i*3][j*3] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3][j*3 + 1] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3][j*3 + 2] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3 + 1][j*3] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3 + 1][j*3 + 1] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3 + 1][j*3 + 2] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3 + 2][j*3] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3 + 2][j*3 + 1] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3 + 2][j*3 + 2] = val\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output grids seem to be formed by expanding the input grid in some way. The output grids are 9x9, while the input grids are 3x3. This suggests that the input grid is being expanded to form the output grid.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput:\n0 7 0\n7 7 7\n0 7 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0\n7 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 7\n0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0\n\nIt seems that the input grid is being replicated in a pattern that forms a 9x9 grid. The input grid's values are being placed in a specific pattern that creates a larger grid.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nInput:\n0 0 6\n0 6 0\n6 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6\n0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0\n6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis example shows a more complex pattern where the input values are being replicated in a way that creates a larger grid with specific patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\nInput:\n4 4 0\n0 0 4\n0 0 4\n\nOutput:\n0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0\n4 4 0 4 4 0 0 0 0\n4 4 0 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0\n\nThis example shows a pattern where the input values are being replicated in a way that creates a larger grid with specific patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replicating the input grid in a specific pattern to form a 9x9 output grid. The exact pattern is not clear, but I'll implement a transformation that replicates the input grid in a way that forms a 9x9 grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Replicate the input grid in a specific pattern to form the output grid\n    # This is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the training examples\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            # Place the value in the output grid in a specific pattern\n            # This is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the training examples\n            transformed_grid[i*3][j*3] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3][j*3 + 1] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3][j*3 + 2] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3 + 1][j*3] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3 + 1][j*3 + 1] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3 + 1][j*3 + 2] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3 + 2][j*3] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3 + 2][j*3 + 1] = val\n            transformed_grid[i*3 + 2][j*3 + 2] = val\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
