The transformation seems to involve some form of \"expansion\" or \"spread\" of values from certain positions.\n2. Values like 4 and 2 seem to be \"spread\" or \"expanded\" into neighboring cells.\n3. Values like 3 and 8 seem to be \"expanded\" or \"spread\" in a more complex pattern.\n4. Values like 1 and 6 seem to be \"expanded\" or \"spread\" in a more complex pattern.\n5.

The transformation seems to involve some form of \"expansion\" or \"spread\" of values from certain positions.\n2. Values like 4 and 2 seem to be \"spread\" or \"expanded\" into neighboring cells.\n3. Values like 3 and 8 seem to be \"expanded\" or \"spread\" in a more complex pattern.\n4. Values like 1 and 6 seem to be \"expanded\" or \"spread\" in a more complex pattern.\n5.
