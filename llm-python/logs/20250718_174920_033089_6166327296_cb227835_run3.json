The output grid often has a \"spiral\" or \"wave\" pattern of numbers\n2. Numbers propagate from a central point outward\n3. There's a pattern of 3s forming a spiral around the 8s\n4. The 8s seem to be the starting points of these patterns\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Identifies the positions of 8s\n- Creates a spiral pattern of 3s around each 8\n- Leaves other positions as 0\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Find positions of 8s\n    eight_positions = np.where(grid_np == 8)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define directions for spiral pattern (right, down, left, up)\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n    \n    # For each 8, create a spiral of 3s around it\n    for (row, col) in eight_positions:\n        direction_index = 0\n        step = 1\n        while True:\n            # Move in current direction\n            new_row, new_col = row + directions[direction_index][0] * step, col + directions[direction_index][1] * step\n            \n            # Check if new position is within bounds\n            if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 13:\n                # If the position is not already 8, set it to 3\n                if transformed[new_row, new_col] != 8:\n                    transformed[new_row, new_col] = 3\n                # Change direction after each step\n                direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 4\n                step += 1\n            else:\n                break\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    eight_positions = np.where(grid_np == 8)\n    \n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n    \n    for (row, col) in eight_positions:\n        direction_index = 0\n        step = 1\n        while True:\n            new_row, new_col = row + directions[direction_index][0] * step, col + directions[direction_index][1] * step\n            if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 13:\n                if transformed[new_row, new_col] != 8:\n                    transformed[new_row, new_col] = 3\n                direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 4\n                step += 1\n            else:\n                break\n    \n    return transformed.tolist()\n```",
