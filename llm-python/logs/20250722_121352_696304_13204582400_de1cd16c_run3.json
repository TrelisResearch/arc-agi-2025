For example, in Example 1, the maximum value is 8, and the output is 8. In Example 2, the maximum value is 8, but the output is 2. So this can't be the pattern.\n\nLooking more closely, I notice that the output seems to be the minimum value that appears in a specific pattern. For example, in Example 1, the value 8 appears in the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner, but the output is 8. In Example 2, the value 2 appears in the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner, but the output is 2. In Example 3, the value 6 appears in the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner, but the output is 6. In Example 4, the value 4 appears in the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner, but the output is 4.\n\nThis suggests that the output is the value that appears in the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid.\n\nLet me write a function that returns the value in the top-left corner of the grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Return the value in the top-left corner of the grid\n    return [grid[0][0]]\n```",
