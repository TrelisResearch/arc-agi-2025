          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation appears to involve replacing certain values with others in specific regions.\n2. There are patterns where certain numbers (like 3, 4, 8) are replaced with others (like 1, 2, 8).\n3. The transformation seems to preserve the general shape and structure of the grid, but with specific values being replaced.\n4. There are patterns where certain regions (like the middle of the grid) have specific values that are replaced in a consistent way.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values in specific regions of the grid. For example, values like 3 might be replaced with 1, 4 with 2, and 8 with 8 (no change).\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace specific values based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    for i in range(27):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # 8 remains unchanged based on example 3\n                pass\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # 2 might be replaced with 1 based on example 3\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # 6 might be replaced with 1 based on example 2\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # 7 might be replaced with 1 based on example 2\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                # 9 might be replaced with 1 based on example 2\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace specific values based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    for i in range(27):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # 8 remains unchanged based on example 3\n                pass\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # 2 might be replaced with 1 based on example 3\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # 6 might be replaced with 1 based on example 2\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # 7 might be replaced with 1 based on example 2\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                # 9 might be replaced with 1 based on example 2\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The transformation appears to involve replacing certain values with others in specific regions.\n2. There are patterns where certain numbers (like 3, 4, 8) are replaced with others (like 1, 2, 8).\n3. The transformation seems to preserve the general shape and structure of the grid, but with specific values being replaced.\n4. There are patterns where certain regions (like the middle of the grid) have specific values that are replaced in a consistent way.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values in specific regions of the grid. For example, values like 3 might be replaced with 1, 4 with 2, and 8 with 8 (no change).\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace specific values based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    for i in range(27):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # 8 remains unchanged based on example 3\n                pass\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # 2 might be replaced with 1 based on example 3\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # 6 might be replaced with 1 based on example 2\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # 7 might be replaced with 1 based on example 2\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                # 9 might be replaced with 1 based on example 2\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace specific values based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    for i in range(27):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # 8 remains unchanged based on example 3\n                pass\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # 2 might be replaced with 1 based on example 3\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # 6 might be replaced with 1 based on example 2\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # 7 might be replaced with 1 based on example 2\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                # 9 might be replaced with 1 based on example 2\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
