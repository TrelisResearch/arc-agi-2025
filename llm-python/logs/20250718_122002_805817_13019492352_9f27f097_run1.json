          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a lot of 2s, and in the output, there's a similar structure but with some changes in the middle. The output seems to have some kind of pattern where certain numbers are replaced. For instance, in the input, there's a section with 2s and 1s and 3s. The output has those same numbers but maybe some transformation around the middle part. Wait, looking at the output, there's a 1 and 3 in positions that were 2s in the input. Maybe there's a pattern where certain regions are transformed based on their neighbors?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 4 in some positions and a 1, and the output has those numbers rearranged. For example, in the input, the 4s are in the middle and the 1s are in other areas. The output seems to have the 4s and 1s swapped in some way. Maybe there's a transformation where certain numbers are moved or replaced based on their positions.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 1 in the corners and a 3 in the middle. The output has some changes in the middle, like the 3s and 2s. The output seems to have some kind of expansion or contraction of certain numbers. For example, in the input, there's a 3 in the middle, and in the output, there's a 3 in the middle but with some 2s around it. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced based on their position relative to other numbers.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers based on their position in the grid. For instance, in Example 1, the middle part of the grid has some 1s and 3s that are transformed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain regions are transformed based on their neighbors. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the middle, and the output has 1 and 3s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is surrounded by certain numbers, it gets replaced with another.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of symmetry or reflection. For example, in Example 2, the output seems to have a mirrored pattern in some parts. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for specific patterns. Let's look at the first example's input and output. The input has a 2 in the first row, and the output is the same. But in the second row, the input is 2 1 3 3 1 2... and the output is the same. But in the middle rows, there's a change. For example, in row 7 of the input, the 0s are replaced with 1 and 3s in the output. Wait, in the input for example 1, row 7 is all 2s except for 0s in positions 5-8. The output for that row has 1 and 3s in those positions. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 and 3s based on their position.\n\nWait, in example 1's input, the middle part has a 0 in positions 5-8 (row 7, columns 5-8). The output for that row has 1, 3, 3, 1. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with numbers based on their position. But how?\n\nLooking at the test input: the input has 8s in the first row, then some 1s and 2s, then 8s again. The output for the test input is not given, but the test input's output is not provided. But maybe the transformation is something like replacing certain numbers based on their neighbors or their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their position in certain regions. For example, in the first example, the middle part of the grid (rows 4-6) has a pattern that's transformed. Maybe the transformation is about expanding or contracting certain numbers based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their value. For example, 0s are replaced with 1s and 3s in certain positions. But how?\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output: the input has a 1 in the corners and a 3 in the middle. The output has the same 1s and 3s but with some 2s in the middle. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers in specific regions. For example, the middle part of the grid is being modified based on some rules.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is based on the distance from the center. For example, cells closer to the center are replaced with certain numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 0s in the middle are replaced with 1 and 3s, which might be part of a pattern that's expanding outward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell has a certain value, it's replaced with another based on surrounding cells.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers in certain regions. For example, in example 1, the middle part of the grid (rows 4-6) has some 1s and 3s that are transformed. Maybe the 1s and 3s are being replaced with other numbers based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the middle part of the grid (rows 4-6) has 1s and 3s in certain positions. The input for example 1 has 2s and 1s and 3s. Maybe the transformation is about replacing 2s with 1s and 3s in certain areas.\n\nBut this is getting a bit vague. Maybe I need to think of a general rule that can apply to all examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input has a 4 in some positions and a 1 in others. The output has 4s and 1s in different positions. For example, in the input, the 4 is in the middle, and in the output, the 4s are in the same positions, but the 1s are moved. Maybe the transformation is about swapping certain numbers based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing numbers in certain regions. For example, in example 2, the middle part of the grid has a 4 and 1, and the output has those numbers in different positions. Maybe the transformation is about rotating or flipping certain parts of the grid.\n\nAnother approach: think about the test input. The test input has 8s in the first row, then some 1s and 2s, then 8s again. The output is not given, but the test input is part of the problem. However, the user hasn't provided the output for the test input, so I need to focus on the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: certain numbers are replaced with others based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding cells with certain values. For example, if a cell has a certain number of 2s around it, it's replaced with 1 or 3.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's input and output. The input has a 3 in the middle, and the output has 3s in the middle but with some 2s around them. The output's middle part has 3s and 2s. Maybe the transformation is about expanding or contracting certain numbers in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s and 3s in certain positions. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced with 1 and 3s. In example 3, the 0s are replaced with 3s and 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, in the middle part of the grid, certain numbers are replaced with others. For example, in example 1, the middle part (rows 4-6) has a pattern that is transformed. Maybe the transformation is about replacing 2s with 1s and 3s in certain regions.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation involves replacing numbers in a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the middle part of the grid is transformed by replacing 2s with 1s and 3s in a specific way. Maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their position in the grid, such as replacing 2s with 1s and 3s in a cross shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 0s in the middle are replaced with 1 and 3s, which might be part of a pattern that's expanding outward.\n\nBut I need to find a general rule that can apply to all examples. Maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers in certain regions based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with a certain value based on its neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers in certain regions. For example, in example 1, the middle part of the grid (rows 4-6) has a pattern that's transformed. Maybe the transformation is about replacing 2s with 1s and 3s in a specific pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the following: the output is the same as the input, except for certain regions where the numbers are replaced based on their position. For example, in example 1, the middle part of the grid (rows 4-6) has some 2s and 1s and 3s that are transformed into 1s and 3s.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing numbers in certain regions based on their distance from the center. For example, cells that are closer to the center are replaced with 1s and 3s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing numbers in certain regions with other numbers based on their position. For example, in example 1, the middle part of the grid (rows 4-6) has a pattern that's transformed. Maybe the transformation is about replacing 2s with 1s and 3s in a specific way.\n\nBut I need to find a way to code this. Maybe the key is to look for patterns in the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output:\n\nInput rows 4-6 (rows 4, 5, 6):\n\nRow 4: 2 1 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 5: 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nOutput rows 4-6:\n\nRow 4: 2 1 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 5: 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nWait, that's the same as the input. But in example 1's output, the rows 7-10 are different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for example 1 is:\n\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 8: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 9: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 10: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\nThe output for these rows is:\n\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 1 3 3 1 2 2 2 2\nRow 8: 2 2 2 2 1 3 1 1 2 2 2 2\nRow 9: 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 2 2 2 2\nRow 10: 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2\n\nSo the 0s in these rows are replaced with 1 and 3s. The pattern seems to be that in these rows, the 0s are in columns 5-8. The output for these rows has 1 and 3s in those columns. For example, row 7 has 1, 3, 3, 1 in columns 5-8. Row 8 has 1, 3, 1, 1. Row 9 has 3, 3, 3, 1. Row 10 has 1, 1, 1, 1.\n\nThis suggests that the 0s are being replaced with a pattern that depends on their position. For example, the first row (row 7) has 1,3,3,1. The second row (row 8) has 1,3,1,1. The third row (row 9) has 3,3,3,1. The fourth row (row 10) has 1,1,1,1.\n\nThis seems like a pattern that's expanding outward. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, the first row (row 7) has 1 and 3 in the middle, while row 10 has all 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with a pattern that depends on their position. For example, the 0s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 1s and 3s in a certain way.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input has a 4 in some positions and a 1 in others. The output has the 4s and 1s in different positions. For example, in the input, row 7 has 2 4 4 4 1 4 2 2 2 2 2 2. The output for that row is 2 4 4 4 1 4 2 2 2 2 2 2. So it's the same. But in other rows, the 4s and 1s are rearranged. For example, row 8 in input is 2 4 4 1 4 4 2 2 2 2 2 2. The output for that row is 2 4 4 1 4 4 2 2 2 2 2 2. So it's the same. But in row 9, the input is 2 4 1 4 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2, and the output is 2 4 1 4 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2. So it's the same. But in row 10, input is 2 4 4 1 4 1 2 2 2 2 2 2, and the output is 2 4 4 1 4 1 2 2 2 2 2 2. So same as input. But in row 6, the input is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2, and the output is the same. So maybe the transformation in example 2 is not changing the input, but that's not possible. Wait, no, the output for example 2 is different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for example 2 is:\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 7: 2 4 4 4 1 4 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 8: 2 4 4 1 4 4 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 9: 2 4 1 4 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 10: 2 4 4 1 4 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 11: 2 4 4 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\nRow 6: same as input\nRow 7: same as input\nRow 8: same as input\nRow 9: same as input\nRow 10: same as input\nRow 11: same as input\n\nBut the output for example 2 is different. Wait, the output for example 2 is:\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 2 4 1 4 4 4 2 2\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 2 4 4 1 4 4 2 2\nRow 8: 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 4 1 4 2 2\nRow 9: 2 2 2 2 2 1 4 1 4 4 2 2\nRow 10: 2 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4 4 2 2\nRow 11: same as input\n\nSo the transformation is changing the input in rows 6-10. For example, in row 6, the input has 2s, but the output has 4 and 1 in certain positions. So maybe the transformation is about replacing certain values in certain regions.\n\nLooking at row 6 of the output for example 2: the input is all 2s, and the output has 4 and 1 in columns 5-8. So the pattern here is that the 2s are replaced with 4 and 1 in a certain way. For example, the first row (row 6) of output is 2 2 2 2 2 4 1 4 4 4 2 2. So columns 5-8 are 4,1,4,4. This seems like a pattern where the middle part is replaced with 4s and 1s. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is about replacing certain regions in the grid with specific patterns based on their position. For example, in example 2, the middle part of the grid (rows 6-10) is being transformed. The 2s in those rows are replaced with 4s and 1s in a certain pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nMaybe the transformation involves replacing certain values in certain regions based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the middle part of the grid, it's replaced with a certain value based on its position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their position relative to certain boundaries. For example, cells in the middle of the grid are replaced with 1s and 3s, while others remain the same.\n\nBut without seeing the output for the test input, it's hard to say. However, the test input has a pattern of 8s in the first row, then some 1s and 2s, then 8s again. The output for the test input is not given, but the transformation should be applied to it.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced with 1 and 3s in certain positions, and in example 2, the 2s are replaced with 4 and 1s in certain positions. So maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers in certain regions based on their position.\n\nBut how to determine what regions and what replacements?\n\nLooking at example 1's test input, the input has 0s in the middle of the grid (rows 7-10, columns 5-8). The output for those rows replaces the 0s with 1 and 3s. Similarly, in example 2, the input has 2s in certain regions that are replaced with 4 and 1s.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation involves replacing certain values in certain regions with other values based on their position.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nMaybe the transformation involves checking if a cell is in a certain region and replacing it with a specific value. For example, for cells in the middle of the grid, replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern.\n\nBut how to determine the regions and the patterns?\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the examples and try to find a rule that applies to all.\n\nIn example 1, the 0s are replaced with a pattern that depends on their row. For example, row 7 has 1,3,3,1 in columns 5-8. Row 8 has 1,3,1,1. Row 9 has 3,3,3,1. Row 10 has 1,1,1,1.\n\nThis seems like a pattern that's expanding outward. For example, row 7 has a cross-like pattern, row 8 has a similar but different pattern, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is based on the distance from the center. For example, cells that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with certain values based on their distance from the center.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a certain shape. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced with a pattern that forms a cross or a diamond.\n\nBut how to code that?\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation involves replacing 0s with 1s and 3s in a certain pattern that depends on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, 0s are replaced with 1s and 3s in a way that forms a certain shape.\n\nBut how to determine that shape?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following rule: if a cell is in a certain region (like the middle part of the grid), then replace it with a certain value based on its position. For example, in the middle part of the grid, replace 0s with 1s and 3s in a way that forms a pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell has a 0, and its neighbors are 2s, then replace it with 1 or 3 based on some rule.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in row i and column j, then replace it with a certain value based on i and j.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the 0s are in rows 7-10, columns 5-8. The output for these rows replaces them with values that form a pattern. For example, row 7 has 1,3,3,1. This could be a pattern where the first and last elements are 1, and the middle are 3. Row 8 has 1,3,1,1. Row 9 has 3,3,3,1. Row 10 has 1,1,1,1.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern depends on the row. For example, row 7: first and last are 1, middle are 3. Row 8: first is 1, then 3, then 1, then 1. Row 9: all 3s except last is 1. Row 10: all 1s.\n\nThis seems like a pattern that is expanding outward. Maybe the transformation is about replacing the 0s with a pattern that depends on their row and column.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s and 3s in a way that forms a certain shape. For example, in the middle of the grid, the 0s are replaced with a pattern that forms a cross or a diamond.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced with 1s and 3s, and in example 2, the 2s are replaced with 4s and 1s. So maybe the transformation is about replacing certain values in certain regions based on their position.\n\nBut how to determine which regions and which values?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers in certain regions based on their position relative to the center of the grid. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with a certain value, and if it's near the edge, it remains the same.\n\nBut again, this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, the transformation seems to involve replacing certain values in certain regions with other values. For example:\n\n- In example 1, 0s are replaced with 1 and 3s in the middle of the grid.\n- In example 2, 2s are replaced with 4 and 1s in the middle of the grid.\n- In example 3, 0s are replaced with 3 and 2s in the middle of the grid.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation involves replacing certain values in the middle of the grid with other values based on their position.\n\nSo, the transformation might be: for cells in the middle of the grid (rows 4-8, columns 4-8?), replace them with certain values based on their position.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are in the middle?\n\nAlternatively, the transformation involves replacing cells in a certain region with values based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, cells are replaced with 1 and 3 in example 1, with 4 and 1 in example 2, and with 3 and 2 in example 3.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nMaybe the transformation is about replacing certain values in the middle of the grid with other values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with a certain value based on its position.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s and 3s in certain patterns, and 2s with 4s and 1s in other patterns.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a pattern that forms a cross or diamond. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced with a cross-like pattern.\n\nBut how to code that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that depends on their row and column. For example, for a cell in row i and column j, if it's in the middle of the grid, replace it with 1 if it's in a certain position, and 3 otherwise.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s and 3s in a way that forms a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the 0s in the middle are replaced with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a cross.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should make a function that replaces 0s in certain regions with 1 and 3s based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a pattern that depends on their row and column.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are in the middle?\n\nMaybe the middle of the grid is rows 4-8 and columns 4-8. For example, in example 1, the 0s are in rows 7-10 and columns 5-8. But that might not be consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the middle of the grid is rows 4-8 and columns 4-8. For example, in example 1, the 0s are in rows 7-10, which is outside of this range. So this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern, and 2s with 4 and 1s in another pattern.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nPerhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern, and 2s with 4 and 1s in another pattern. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced with 1 and 3s in a cross-like pattern, and in example 2, the 2s are replaced with 4 and 1s in a similar pattern.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe the code could check if a cell is in a certain region (like the middle of the grid), and then replace it with a certain value based on its position.\n\nFor example, in the middle region of the grid, replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a pattern that depends on the row and column.\n\nBut how to determine the region?\n\nMaybe the region is defined as rows 4-8 and columns 4-8. For example, in example 1, the 0s are in rows 7-10 and columns 5-8, which is outside of this range. So this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the region is rows 6-9 and columns 6-9.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is about replacing cells that are in the middle of the grid with certain values. For example, in example 1, the middle of the grid is replaced with 1 and 3s, and in example 2, it's replaced with 4 and 1s.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nPerhaps the transformation is about replacing cells in the middle of the grid with certain values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with 1 or 3, depending on its position.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that replaces 0s with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern, and 2s with 4 and 1s in another pattern, based on their position.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a cross or diamond. For example, in example 1, the 0s in the middle are replaced with a cross-like pattern.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that depends on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, replace with 1 and 3 in a certain way.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I think the best approach is to write a function that replaces 0s with 1 and 3s in certain patterns based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a cross.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nPerhaps the code could check if the cell is in the middle of the grid and replace it with a certain value. For example, for cells in rows 4-8 and columns 4-8, replace 0s with 1 and 3s based on their position.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a pattern where the middle of the replaced region is 3, and the edges are 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that depends on the row. For example, in rows 7-10, replace the 0s with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s in the middle of the grid with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern, and 2s with 4 and 1s in another pattern, based on their position.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the code could check if the cell is in the middle of the grid (rows 4-8 and columns 4-8), and then replace it with certain values based on their position.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a pattern where the middle of the replaced region is 3, and the edges are 1.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe for the middle region, the code replaces 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a cross. For example, in the middle row, replace with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that depends on their position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the replaced region, replace with 3, else with 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s with 1 and 3s in certain positions, and 2s with 4 and 1s in other positions, based on their position.\n\nFor example:\n\n- For each cell in the grid, if it is a 0 and is in the middle of the grid (rows 4-8 and columns 4-8), replace it with 1 or 3 based on its position.\n- Similarly for other values.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code might look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Define the middle region\n    middle_rows = range(4, 8)\n    middle_cols = range(4, 8)\n    # Replace 0s in the middle region\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if i in middle_rows and j in middle_cols:\n                if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                    # Replace with 1 or 3 based on position\n                    # For example, if i is even, replace with 1, else 3\n                    # This is a guess\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1 if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else 3\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess and may not work for the examples.\n\nAlternatively, for example 1, the 0s in rows 7-10, columns 5-8 are replaced with 1 and 3s. So perhaps the code should check if the cell is in rows 7-10 and columns 5-8, and replace 0s with certain values.\n\nBut this is specific to example 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a pattern. For example, in rows 7-10, columns 5-8:\n\nRow 7: 1,3,3,1\nRow 8: 1,3,1,1\nRow 9: 3,3,3,1\nRow 10: 1,1,1,1\n\nThis suggests that for row i, column j in this region, the value is 1 if it's on the edge, and 3 if it's in the middle.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nFor example, in row 7 (i=7), columns 5-8 (j=5-8):\n\n- j=5: 1\n- j=6: 3\n- j=7: 3\n- j=8: 1\n\nThis is a symmetric pattern around the middle of the row.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 (i=8):\n\n- j=5: 1\n- j=6: 3\n- j=7: 1\n- j=8: 1\n\nThis is not symmetric, but perhaps it's based on the row number.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to make a best guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a pattern that depends on their row and column, and similarly for other values.\n\nBut since the test input has 8s in the first row and 0s in the middle, perhaps the code should replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a cross. For example, in the middle of the grid, replace 0s with 1s and 3s in a cross shape.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nMaybe for each cell in the middle of the grid, if it's on the same row as the center or the same column as the center, replace with 3, else 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the code could replace 0s with 1 and 3s based on their distance from the center.\n\nFor example, if the distance from the center is 0, replace with 3; if it's 1, replace with 1; if it's 2, replace with 3, etc.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern, and 2s with 4 and 1s in another pattern, based on their position.\n\nBut since I'm not sure, I'll make a function that replaces 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a cross in the middle of the grid.\n\nThe code might look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Define the center of the grid\n    center = 6  # since it's 12x12, center is at 5.5, so rows 5-6?\n    # Replace 0s in the middle region\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if it's in the middle region\n                if 4 <= i <= 8 and 4 <= j <= 8:\n                    # Replace with 1 or 3 based on position\n                    # For example, if it's in the middle row or column, replace with 3\n                    if i == 6 or j == 6:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 3\n                    else:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 1\n    return transformed\n\nThis code replaces 0s in the middle region (rows 4-8, columns 4-8) with 3 if they are in the middle row or column, else 1. This might match example 1, where the 0s are replaced with 1 and 3s in the middle region.\n\nBut this is just a guess. For example 1, the 0s are in rows 7-10, columns 5-8. But the code replaces 0s in rows 4-8 and columns 4-8. So for row 7, columns 5-8, this code would replace 0s with 3 if they are in column 6 (since j=6 is the middle column). But in example 1, row 7 has 1,3,3,1 in columns 5-8. So this code would replace j=5 with 1 (since i=7 is not 6), j=6 with 3 (since j=6 is the middle column), j=7 with 3 (since j=7 is not the middle column?), but this is not matching.\n\nHmm, this code might not work for example 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should replace 0s in the middle region with 1 and 3 based on their position in the row and column. For example, for row i, column j in the middle region:\n\nif i is even, replace with 1, else 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach and write the code.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a lot of 2s, and in the output, there's a similar structure but with some changes in the middle. The output seems to have some kind of pattern where certain numbers are replaced. For instance, in the input, there's a section with 2s and 1s and 3s. The output has those same numbers but maybe some transformation around the middle part. Wait, looking at the output, there's a 1 and 3 in positions that were 2s in the input. Maybe there's a pattern where certain regions are transformed based on their neighbors?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 4 in some positions and a 1, and the output has those numbers rearranged. For example, in the input, the 4s are in the middle and the 1s are in other areas. The output seems to have the 4s and 1s swapped in some way. Maybe there's a transformation where certain numbers are moved or replaced based on their positions.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 1 in the corners and a 3 in the middle. The output has some changes in the middle, like the 3s and 2s. The output seems to have some kind of expansion or contraction of certain numbers. For example, in the input, there's a 3 in the middle, and in the output, there's a 3 in the middle but with some 2s around it. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced based on their position relative to other numbers.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers based on their position in the grid. For instance, in Example 1, the middle part of the grid has some 1s and 3s that are transformed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain regions are transformed based on their neighbors. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the middle, and the output has 1 and 3s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is surrounded by certain numbers, it gets replaced with another.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of symmetry or reflection. For example, in Example 2, the output seems to have a mirrored pattern in some parts. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for specific patterns. Let's look at the first example's input and output. The input has a 2 in the first row, and the output is the same. But in the second row, the input is 2 1 3 3 1 2... and the output is the same. But in the middle rows, there's a change. For example, in row 7 of the input, the 0s are replaced with 1 and 3s in the output. Wait, in the input for example 1, row 7 is all 2s except for 0s in positions 5-8. The output for that row has 1 and 3s in those positions. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 and 3s based on their position.\n\nWait, in example 1's input, the middle part has a 0 in positions 5-8 (row 7, columns 5-8). The output for that row has 1, 3, 3, 1. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with numbers based on their position. But how?\n\nLooking at the test input: the input has 8s in the first row, then some 1s and 2s, then 8s again. The output for the test input is not given, but the test input's output is not provided. But maybe the transformation is something like replacing certain numbers based on their neighbors or their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their position in certain regions. For example, in the first example, the middle part of the grid (rows 4-6) has a pattern that's transformed. Maybe the transformation is about expanding or contracting certain numbers based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their value. For example, 0s are replaced with 1s and 3s in certain positions. But how?\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output: the input has a 1 in the corners and a 3 in the middle. The output has the same 1s and 3s but with some 2s in the middle. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers in specific regions. For example, the middle part of the grid is being modified based on some rules.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is based on the distance from the center. For example, cells closer to the center are replaced with certain numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 0s in the middle are replaced with 1 and 3s, which might be part of a pattern that's expanding outward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell has a certain value, it's replaced with another based on surrounding cells.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers in certain regions. For example, in example 1, the middle part of the grid (rows 4-6) has some 1s and 3s that are transformed. Maybe the 1s and 3s are being replaced with other numbers based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the middle part of the grid (rows 4-6) has 1s and 3s in certain positions. The input for example 1 has 2s and 1s and 3s. Maybe the transformation is about replacing 2s with 1s and 3s in certain areas.\n\nBut this is getting a bit vague. Maybe I need to think of a general rule that can apply to all examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input has a 4 in some positions and a 1 in others. The output has 4s and 1s in different positions. For example, in the input, the 4 is in the middle, and in the output, the 4s are in the same positions, but the 1s are moved. Maybe the transformation is about swapping certain numbers based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing numbers in certain regions. For example, in example 2, the middle part of the grid has a 4 and 1, and the output has those numbers in different positions. Maybe the transformation is about rotating or flipping certain parts of the grid.\n\nAnother approach: think about the test input. The test input has 8s in the first row, then some 1s and 2s, then 8s again. The output is not given, but the test input is part of the problem. However, the user hasn't provided the output for the test input, so I need to focus on the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: certain numbers are replaced with others based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding cells with certain values. For example, if a cell has a certain number of 2s around it, it's replaced with 1 or 3.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's input and output. The input has a 3 in the middle, and the output has 3s in the middle but with some 2s around them. The output's middle part has 3s and 2s. Maybe the transformation is about expanding or contracting certain numbers in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s and 3s in certain positions. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced with 1 and 3s. In example 3, the 0s are replaced with 3s and 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, in the middle part of the grid, certain numbers are replaced with others. For example, in example 1, the middle part (rows 4-6) has a pattern that is transformed. Maybe the transformation is about replacing 2s with 1s and 3s in certain regions.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation involves replacing numbers in a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the middle part of the grid is transformed by replacing 2s with 1s and 3s in a specific way. Maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their position in the grid, such as replacing 2s with 1s and 3s in a cross shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 0s in the middle are replaced with 1 and 3s, which might be part of a pattern that's expanding outward.\n\nBut I need to find a general rule that can apply to all examples. Maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers in certain regions based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with a certain value based on its neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers in certain regions. For example, in example 1, the middle part of the grid (rows 4-6) has a pattern that's transformed. Maybe the transformation is about replacing 2s with 1s and 3s in a specific pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the following: the output is the same as the input, except for certain regions where the numbers are replaced based on their position. For example, in example 1, the middle part of the grid (rows 4-6) has some 2s and 1s and 3s that are transformed into 1s and 3s.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing numbers in certain regions based on their distance from the center. For example, cells that are closer to the center are replaced with 1s and 3s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing numbers in certain regions with other numbers based on their position. For example, in example 1, the middle part of the grid (rows 4-6) has a pattern that's transformed. Maybe the transformation is about replacing 2s with 1s and 3s in a specific way.\n\nBut I need to find a way to code this. Maybe the key is to look for patterns in the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output:\n\nInput rows 4-6 (rows 4, 5, 6):\n\nRow 4: 2 1 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 5: 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nOutput rows 4-6:\n\nRow 4: 2 1 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 5: 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nWait, that's the same as the input. But in example 1's output, the rows 7-10 are different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for example 1 is:\n\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 8: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 9: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 10: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\nThe output for these rows is:\n\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 1 3 3 1 2 2 2 2\nRow 8: 2 2 2 2 1 3 1 1 2 2 2 2\nRow 9: 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 2 2 2 2\nRow 10: 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2\n\nSo the 0s in these rows are replaced with 1 and 3s. The pattern seems to be that in these rows, the 0s are in columns 5-8. The output for these rows has 1 and 3s in those columns. For example, row 7 has 1, 3, 3, 1 in columns 5-8. Row 8 has 1, 3, 1, 1. Row 9 has 3, 3, 3, 1. Row 10 has 1, 1, 1, 1.\n\nThis suggests that the 0s are being replaced with a pattern that depends on their position. For example, the first row (row 7) has 1,3,3,1. The second row (row 8) has 1,3,1,1. The third row (row 9) has 3,3,3,1. The fourth row (row 10) has 1,1,1,1.\n\nThis seems like a pattern that's expanding outward. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, the first row (row 7) has 1 and 3 in the middle, while row 10 has all 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with a pattern that depends on their position. For example, the 0s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 1s and 3s in a certain way.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input has a 4 in some positions and a 1 in others. The output has the 4s and 1s in different positions. For example, in the input, row 7 has 2 4 4 4 1 4 2 2 2 2 2 2. The output for that row is 2 4 4 4 1 4 2 2 2 2 2 2. So it's the same. But in other rows, the 4s and 1s are rearranged. For example, row 8 in input is 2 4 4 1 4 4 2 2 2 2 2 2. The output for that row is 2 4 4 1 4 4 2 2 2 2 2 2. So it's the same. But in row 9, the input is 2 4 1 4 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2, and the output is 2 4 1 4 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2. So it's the same. But in row 10, input is 2 4 4 1 4 1 2 2 2 2 2 2, and the output is 2 4 4 1 4 1 2 2 2 2 2 2. So same as input. But in row 6, the input is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2, and the output is the same. So maybe the transformation in example 2 is not changing the input, but that's not possible. Wait, no, the output for example 2 is different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for example 2 is:\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 7: 2 4 4 4 1 4 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 8: 2 4 4 1 4 4 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 9: 2 4 1 4 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 10: 2 4 4 1 4 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 11: 2 4 4 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\nRow 6: same as input\nRow 7: same as input\nRow 8: same as input\nRow 9: same as input\nRow 10: same as input\nRow 11: same as input\n\nBut the output for example 2 is different. Wait, the output for example 2 is:\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 2 4 1 4 4 4 2 2\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 2 4 4 1 4 4 2 2\nRow 8: 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 4 1 4 2 2\nRow 9: 2 2 2 2 2 1 4 1 4 4 2 2\nRow 10: 2 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4 4 2 2\nRow 11: same as input\n\nSo the transformation is changing the input in rows 6-10. For example, in row 6, the input has 2s, but the output has 4 and 1 in certain positions. So maybe the transformation is about replacing certain values in certain regions.\n\nLooking at row 6 of the output for example 2: the input is all 2s, and the output has 4 and 1 in columns 5-8. So the pattern here is that the 2s are replaced with 4 and 1 in a certain way. For example, the first row (row 6) of output is 2 2 2 2 2 4 1 4 4 4 2 2. So columns 5-8 are 4,1,4,4. This seems like a pattern where the middle part is replaced with 4s and 1s. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is about replacing certain regions in the grid with specific patterns based on their position. For example, in example 2, the middle part of the grid (rows 6-10) is being transformed. The 2s in those rows are replaced with 4s and 1s in a certain pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nMaybe the transformation involves replacing certain values in certain regions based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the middle part of the grid, it's replaced with a certain value based on its position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their position relative to certain boundaries. For example, cells in the middle of the grid are replaced with 1s and 3s, while others remain the same.\n\nBut without seeing the output for the test input, it's hard to say. However, the test input has a pattern of 8s in the first row, then some 1s and 2s, then 8s again. The output for the test input is not given, but the transformation should be applied to it.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced with 1 and 3s in certain positions, and in example 2, the 2s are replaced with 4 and 1s in certain positions. So maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers in certain regions based on their position.\n\nBut how to determine what regions and what replacements?\n\nLooking at example 1's test input, the input has 0s in the middle of the grid (rows 7-10, columns 5-8). The output for those rows replaces the 0s with 1 and 3s. Similarly, in example 2, the input has 2s in certain regions that are replaced with 4 and 1s.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation involves replacing certain values in certain regions with other values based on their position.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nMaybe the transformation involves checking if a cell is in a certain region and replacing it with a specific value. For example, for cells in the middle of the grid, replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern.\n\nBut how to determine the regions and the patterns?\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the examples and try to find a rule that applies to all.\n\nIn example 1, the 0s are replaced with a pattern that depends on their row. For example, row 7 has 1,3,3,1 in columns 5-8. Row 8 has 1,3,1,1. Row 9 has 3,3,3,1. Row 10 has 1,1,1,1.\n\nThis seems like a pattern that's expanding outward. For example, row 7 has a cross-like pattern, row 8 has a similar but different pattern, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is based on the distance from the center. For example, cells that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with certain values based on their distance from the center.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a certain shape. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced with a pattern that forms a cross or a diamond.\n\nBut how to code that?\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation involves replacing 0s with 1s and 3s in a certain pattern that depends on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, 0s are replaced with 1s and 3s in a way that forms a certain shape.\n\nBut how to determine that shape?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following rule: if a cell is in a certain region (like the middle part of the grid), then replace it with a certain value based on its position. For example, in the middle part of the grid, replace 0s with 1s and 3s in a way that forms a pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell has a 0, and its neighbors are 2s, then replace it with 1 or 3 based on some rule.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in row i and column j, then replace it with a certain value based on i and j.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the 0s are in rows 7-10, columns 5-8. The output for these rows replaces them with values that form a pattern. For example, row 7 has 1,3,3,1. This could be a pattern where the first and last elements are 1, and the middle are 3. Row 8 has 1,3,1,1. Row 9 has 3,3,3,1. Row 10 has 1,1,1,1.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern depends on the row. For example, row 7: first and last are 1, middle are 3. Row 8: first is 1, then 3, then 1, then 1. Row 9: all 3s except last is 1. Row 10: all 1s.\n\nThis seems like a pattern that is expanding outward. Maybe the transformation is about replacing the 0s with a pattern that depends on their row and column.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s and 3s in a way that forms a certain shape. For example, in the middle of the grid, the 0s are replaced with a pattern that forms a cross or a diamond.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced with 1s and 3s, and in example 2, the 2s are replaced with 4s and 1s. So maybe the transformation is about replacing certain values in certain regions based on their position.\n\nBut how to determine which regions and which values?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers in certain regions based on their position relative to the center of the grid. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with a certain value, and if it's near the edge, it remains the same.\n\nBut again, this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, the transformation seems to involve replacing certain values in certain regions with other values. For example:\n\n- In example 1, 0s are replaced with 1 and 3s in the middle of the grid.\n- In example 2, 2s are replaced with 4 and 1s in the middle of the grid.\n- In example 3, 0s are replaced with 3 and 2s in the middle of the grid.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation involves replacing certain values in the middle of the grid with other values based on their position.\n\nSo, the transformation might be: for cells in the middle of the grid (rows 4-8, columns 4-8?), replace them with certain values based on their position.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are in the middle?\n\nAlternatively, the transformation involves replacing cells in a certain region with values based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, cells are replaced with 1 and 3 in example 1, with 4 and 1 in example 2, and with 3 and 2 in example 3.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nMaybe the transformation is about replacing certain values in the middle of the grid with other values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with a certain value based on its position.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s and 3s in certain patterns, and 2s with 4s and 1s in other patterns.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a pattern that forms a cross or diamond. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced with a cross-like pattern.\n\nBut how to code that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that depends on their row and column. For example, for a cell in row i and column j, if it's in the middle of the grid, replace it with 1 if it's in a certain position, and 3 otherwise.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s and 3s in a way that forms a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the 0s in the middle are replaced with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a cross.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should make a function that replaces 0s in certain regions with 1 and 3s based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a pattern that depends on their row and column.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are in the middle?\n\nMaybe the middle of the grid is rows 4-8 and columns 4-8. For example, in example 1, the 0s are in rows 7-10 and columns 5-8. But that might not be consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the middle of the grid is rows 4-8 and columns 4-8. For example, in example 1, the 0s are in rows 7-10, which is outside of this range. So this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern, and 2s with 4 and 1s in another pattern.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nPerhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern, and 2s with 4 and 1s in another pattern. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced with 1 and 3s in a cross-like pattern, and in example 2, the 2s are replaced with 4 and 1s in a similar pattern.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe the code could check if a cell is in a certain region (like the middle of the grid), and then replace it with a certain value based on its position.\n\nFor example, in the middle region of the grid, replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a pattern that depends on the row and column.\n\nBut how to determine the region?\n\nMaybe the region is defined as rows 4-8 and columns 4-8. For example, in example 1, the 0s are in rows 7-10 and columns 5-8, which is outside of this range. So this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the region is rows 6-9 and columns 6-9.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is about replacing cells that are in the middle of the grid with certain values. For example, in example 1, the middle of the grid is replaced with 1 and 3s, and in example 2, it's replaced with 4 and 1s.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nPerhaps the transformation is about replacing cells in the middle of the grid with certain values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with 1 or 3, depending on its position.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that replaces 0s with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern, and 2s with 4 and 1s in another pattern, based on their position.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a cross or diamond. For example, in example 1, the 0s in the middle are replaced with a cross-like pattern.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that depends on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, replace with 1 and 3 in a certain way.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I think the best approach is to write a function that replaces 0s with 1 and 3s in certain patterns based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a cross.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nPerhaps the code could check if the cell is in the middle of the grid and replace it with a certain value. For example, for cells in rows 4-8 and columns 4-8, replace 0s with 1 and 3s based on their position.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a pattern where the middle of the replaced region is 3, and the edges are 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that depends on the row. For example, in rows 7-10, replace the 0s with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s in the middle of the grid with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern, and 2s with 4 and 1s in another pattern, based on their position.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the code could check if the cell is in the middle of the grid (rows 4-8 and columns 4-8), and then replace it with certain values based on their position.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a pattern where the middle of the replaced region is 3, and the edges are 1.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe for the middle region, the code replaces 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a cross. For example, in the middle row, replace with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that depends on their position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the replaced region, replace with 3, else with 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s with 1 and 3s in certain positions, and 2s with 4 and 1s in other positions, based on their position.\n\nFor example:\n\n- For each cell in the grid, if it is a 0 and is in the middle of the grid (rows 4-8 and columns 4-8), replace it with 1 or 3 based on its position.\n- Similarly for other values.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code might look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Define the middle region\n    middle_rows = range(4, 8)\n    middle_cols = range(4, 8)\n    # Replace 0s in the middle region\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if i in middle_rows and j in middle_cols:\n                if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                    # Replace with 1 or 3 based on position\n                    # For example, if i is even, replace with 1, else 3\n                    # This is a guess\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1 if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else 3\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess and may not work for the examples.\n\nAlternatively, for example 1, the 0s in rows 7-10, columns 5-8 are replaced with 1 and 3s. So perhaps the code should check if the cell is in rows 7-10 and columns 5-8, and replace 0s with certain values.\n\nBut this is specific to example 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a pattern. For example, in rows 7-10, columns 5-8:\n\nRow 7: 1,3,3,1\nRow 8: 1,3,1,1\nRow 9: 3,3,3,1\nRow 10: 1,1,1,1\n\nThis suggests that for row i, column j in this region, the value is 1 if it's on the edge, and 3 if it's in the middle.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nFor example, in row 7 (i=7), columns 5-8 (j=5-8):\n\n- j=5: 1\n- j=6: 3\n- j=7: 3\n- j=8: 1\n\nThis is a symmetric pattern around the middle of the row.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 (i=8):\n\n- j=5: 1\n- j=6: 3\n- j=7: 1\n- j=8: 1\n\nThis is not symmetric, but perhaps it's based on the row number.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to make a best guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a pattern that depends on their row and column, and similarly for other values.\n\nBut since the test input has 8s in the first row and 0s in the middle, perhaps the code should replace 0s with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a cross. For example, in the middle of the grid, replace 0s with 1s and 3s in a cross shape.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nMaybe for each cell in the middle of the grid, if it's on the same row as the center or the same column as the center, replace with 3, else 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the code could replace 0s with 1 and 3s based on their distance from the center.\n\nFor example, if the distance from the center is 0, replace with 3; if it's 1, replace with 1; if it's 2, replace with 3, etc.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s with 1 and 3s in a certain pattern, and 2s with 4 and 1s in another pattern, based on their position.\n\nBut since I'm not sure, I'll make a function that replaces 0s with 1 and 3s in a way that forms a cross in the middle of the grid.\n\nThe code might look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Define the center of the grid\n    center = 6  # since it's 12x12, center is at 5.5, so rows 5-6?\n    # Replace 0s in the middle region\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if it's in the middle region\n                if 4 <= i <= 8 and 4 <= j <= 8:\n                    # Replace with 1 or 3 based on position\n                    # For example, if it's in the middle row or column, replace with 3\n                    if i == 6 or j == 6:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 3\n                    else:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 1\n    return transformed\n\nThis code replaces 0s in the middle region (rows 4-8, columns 4-8) with 3 if they are in the middle row or column, else 1. This might match example 1, where the 0s are replaced with 1 and 3s in the middle region.\n\nBut this is just a guess. For example 1, the 0s are in rows 7-10, columns 5-8. But the code replaces 0s in rows 4-8 and columns 4-8. So for row 7, columns 5-8, this code would replace 0s with 3 if they are in column 6 (since j=6 is the middle column). But in example 1, row 7 has 1,3,3,1 in columns 5-8. So this code would replace j=5 with 1 (since i=7 is not 6), j=6 with 3 (since j=6 is the middle column), j=7 with 3 (since j=7 is not the middle column?), but this is not matching.\n\nHmm, this code might not work for example 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should replace 0s in the middle region with 1 and 3 based on their position in the row and column. For example, for row i, column j in the middle region:\n\nif i is even, replace with 1, else 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach and write the code.\n"
