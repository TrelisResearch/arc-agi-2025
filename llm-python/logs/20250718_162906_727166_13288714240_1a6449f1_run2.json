The output grids seem to be formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input grid, and applying some transformation.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that the output grid seems to be formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input grid, and applying some transformation. The pattern appears to be:\n\n1. Take certain rows from the input grid (specific rows)\n2. Take certain columns from the input grid (specific columns)\n3. Apply some transformation to the selected cells\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that takes specific rows and columns from the input grid and applies a transformation to the selected cells.\n\nHere's my hypothesis for the transformation:\n\n- Take rows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 from the input grid\n- Take columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 from the input grid\n- For each cell in the output grid, if the value is 0, replace it with 0; otherwise, replace it with the value from the input grid\n\nThis seems to be a reasonable hypothesis based on the examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take specific rows and columns from the input grid\n    selected_rows = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n    selected_cols = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in selected_rows:\n        new_row = []\n        for col in selected_cols:\n            # If the value is 0, keep it as 0; otherwise, keep the value from the input grid\n            new_row.append(grid[row][col] if grid[row][col] != 0 else 0)\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
