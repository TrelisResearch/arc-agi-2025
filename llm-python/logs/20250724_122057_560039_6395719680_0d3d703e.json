Let me see if there's a mathematical pattern:\n- 1 \u2192 5 (+4)\n- 2 \u2192 6 (+4)\n- 3 \u2192 4 (+1)\n- 4 \u2192 3 (-1)\n- 5 \u2192 1 (-4)\n- 6 \u2192 2 (-4)\n- 8 \u2192 9 (+1)\n- 9 \u2192 8 (-1)\n\nThis doesn't seem consistent. Let me check if it's a more complex pattern.\n\nLooking more carefully, I notice:\n- 1\u21945, 2\u21946, 3\u21944, 8\u21949\n- These seem to be pairs that map to each other with some transformation\n\nActually, let me reconsider the pattern. Looking at all mappings:\n1\u21925, 2\u21926, 3\u21924, 4\u21923, 5\u21921, 6\u21922, 8\u21929, 9\u21928\n\nI notice these are almost like symmetric pairs around a center:\n- 1\u21925, 5\u21921\n- 2\u21926, 6\u21922\n- 3\u21924, 4\u21923\n- 8\u21929, 9\u21928\n\nThis looks like a specific substitution cipher. Let me create a mapping dictionary:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create mapping based on observed patterns\n    mapping = {\n        1: 5,\n        2: 6,\n        3: 4,\n        4: 3,\n        5: 1,\n        6: 2,\n        7: 7,  # 7 is not in examples, keep it unchanged\n        8: 9,\n        9: 8,\n        0: 0   # 0 is not in examples, keep it unchanged\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the transformation to each element in the grid\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for element in row:\n            new_row.append(mapping.get(element, element))  # Use original if not in mapping\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
