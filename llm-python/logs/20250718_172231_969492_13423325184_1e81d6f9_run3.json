          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that:\n1. The first column (index 0) remains unchanged in all examples\n2. The fourth column (index 3) contains the value 5 in the input and remains 5 in the output\n3. The value 3 appears in the 13th column (index 12) in the first example, but is changed to 0 in the output\n4. The value 8 appears in the 7th column (index 6) in the second example, but is changed to 0 in the output\n5. The value 9 appears in the 10th column (index 9) in the third example, but is changed to 0 in the output\n6. The value 7 appears in the 13th column (index 12) in the first example, but is changed to 0 in the output\n7. The value 4 appears in the 9th column (index 8) in the first example, but is changed to 0 in the output\n8. The value 2 appears in the 14th column (index 14) in the first example, but is changed to 0 in the output\n9. The value 6 appears in the 13th column (index 12) in the first example, but is changed to 0 in the output\n10. The value 1 appears in the 13th column (index 12) in the first example, but is changed to 0 in the output\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves setting certain values to 0 based on their position and value. Specifically, it seems like values in certain columns (like column 12) are being set to 0 in the output.\n\nBased on this pattern, I'll implement a transformation that sets certain values to 0 based on their position and value.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Set values in specific columns to 0 based on observed patterns\n    # These are columns that seem to have values set to 0 in the output\n    for row in range(15):\n        # Set column 12 to 0\n        transformed_grid[row][12] = 0\n        # Set column 14 to 0\n        transformed_grid[row][14] = 0\n        # Set column 9 to 0\n        transformed_grid[row][9] = 0\n        # Set column 8 to 0\n        transformed_grid[row][8] = 0\n        # Set column 6 to 0\n        transformed_grid[row][6] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
