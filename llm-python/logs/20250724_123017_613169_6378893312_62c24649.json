The pattern appears to involve mirroring/reflection operations\n\nLet me examine the transformations more carefully:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input: 3\u00d73 grid\n- Output: 6\u00d76 grid that appears to have horizontal and vertical mirroring\n\nLooking at the structure:\n- First row: [3 3 3] becomes [3 3 3 3 3 3] (mirrored horizontally)\n- Second row: [0 2 2] becomes [0 2 2 2 2 0] \n- Third row: [1 1 0] becomes [1 1 0 0 1 1]\n- Then it's mirrored vertically\n\nLet me trace this more systematically:\n- The output seems to be created by:\n  1. Taking each row and mirroring it horizontally (appending the reverse)\n  2. Then mirroring the entire top half vertically (appending the reverse rows)\n\nLet me check this hypothesis with Example 1:\nInput rows:\n- Row 0: [3, 3, 3] \u2192 mirrored: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n- Row 1: [0, 2, 2] \u2192 mirrored: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n- Row 2: [1, 1, 0] \u2192 mirrored: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nThen vertical mirror:\n- Output rows 0-2: [3,3,3,3,3,3], [0,2,2,2,2,0], [1,1,0,0,1,1]\n- Output rows 3-5: [1,1,0,0,1,1], [0,2,2,2,2,0], [3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nThis matches!
