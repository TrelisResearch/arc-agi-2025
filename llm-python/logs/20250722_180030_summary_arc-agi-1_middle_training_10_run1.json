              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to transform the input grid into the output grid as per the examples. Let's start by analyzing the examples to find out the pattern.\n\nFirst, the input grid has 5s and 0s, and the output grid has 1s and 2s. So the transformation is from 5 to either 1 or 2, depending on the context. The output grid's non-zero cells are determined by the positions and the surrounding cells in the input grid.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a vertical column of 5s in the third column and a diagonal of 5s. The output has 2s in certain positions and 1s in others. Maybe the output color depends on some rules like the number of adjacent 5s in the input grid, or the distance from the nearest 5.\n\nAnother thing is that in the output, the value seems to be determined by how many 5s are in the same \"connected component\" in the input grid. For instance, in Example 1, the output has 2s where there are multiple connected 5s in a diagonal line. But in the top-left part, there's a single 5 that might be in a different component, so it's assigned 1. Wait, but in the output, the top-left 5 in the input (row 0, col 2) is transformed to 2, and the one at row 8, col 8 is 1. Hmm, maybe it's not about the number of adjacent cells but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color depends on whether the input cell is part of the main diagonal (i == j) or not. But looking at Example 2, the output has 2s and 1s in different regions. Not sure.\n\nWait, in Example 3's input, the output is a mix of 1s and 2s, and it seems that the 2s are in positions that are even in some way, while 1s are in others. But this might be a stretch.\n\nLet me try to think of the color assignment as based on the distance to the nearest 5 in the input grid. But in the output, the color is 1 or 2. Maybe the value is determined by the number of steps away from the nearest 5. For example, if the distance is 0 (directly on a 5), then maybe it's 2. But the output in example 1 has some 2s and 1s where the input has 5s. Wait, in example 1, the output has 2s in some places where the input had 5s. Wait, no, in example 1, the input cells that are 5s are transformed to 2s or 1s? Wait, in the output grid for example 1, the input cells that are 5s are transformed to 2s or 1s? Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's output, the output grid's non-zero cells are 2s and 1s. For example, the cell (2,2) in the output is 2, which was originally 5 in the input. So the transformation is not just based on the input cell's value. So the output is not just for the input's 5s, but also for adjacent cells. Wait, but the input is a grid of 0s and 5s, and the output is a grid of 0s and 1s or 2s. So the transformation must be for all cells that are not 0, but the output is not just a copy of 5s, but transformed into 1s and 2s based on some pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the output of example 1, the input has a vertical column of 5s in columns 2-4 (rows 2-4), and some other 5s. The output has 2s in certain cells. For instance, in row 2, columns 2-4 (input is 5), output is 2. But in row 8, column 1 (input is 5), output is 1. So maybe the transformation is based on the parity of the row or column? Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color is determined by the number of 5s in the input in the same diagonal. For example, in Example 1's input, the main diagonal (i == j) has 5s in certain cells, but not all. Wait, maybe the output color is determined by the sum of the input's 5s in the same row and column. But that's too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1, the output grid has 2s in certain positions. For instance, in the input, the cell (2,2) is 5. The output is 2. The cell (8,1) is 5 in input, but output is 1. So why the difference? What's special about these cells?\n\nMaybe the value is 2 if the cell is part of a diagonal line of 5s that is longer than a certain length, and 1 otherwise. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by whether the cell is part of the main diagonal (i == j) or not. For example, in example 3's output, the cells that are on the main diagonal are assigned 1, and others are 2. But example 1's output has some 2s and 1s, so that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe the color depends on the coordinates of the cell. For example, if the cell's row plus column is even, then 2, else 1. Let's check example 1's output.\n\nFor cell (2,2): row 2 + column 2 = 4, even \u2192 2. Correct. Cell (8,1): 8+1=9 \u2192 odd \u2192 1. Correct. Cell (0,2): 0+2=2 even \u2192 2. Correct. Cell (8,8): 16 even \u2192 but the output is 1. Wait, no. In example 3's output, the cell (8,8) is 2. Wait, maybe this is not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color is determined by the number of 5s in the same row and column of the input. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as being an image where each 5 in the input is a source of diffusion, and the output is the value based on the number of steps required to reach that 5. But the examples don't support uniform steps.\n\nAnother approach: observe that in example 2's input, the output has 2s and 1s. For example, the cell (2,2) in the output is 2. The input cell (2,2) is 5. Wait, but the output grid is not directly mapping 5s to 2s. So maybe the output is for all cells that are adjacent to 5s, not just the input 5s.\n\nWait, the output grid has non-zero values in cells that are connected to some 5s. For example, in example 1's output, the cell (0,2) has a value of 2. The input cell (0,2) is 5, so why is it 2? Or is it that the output grid is a combination of the input's 5s and their neighbors, transformed into 1s and 2s based on some criteria.\n\nBut how to determine the exact criteria.\n\nLooking at example 1's output grid, the non-zero cells are 1s and 2s. The 2s are in certain positions. For example, in the input, the cells in the third column are 5s. The output has 2s in those positions. However, in the input, there are cells in other positions that are 5s, but their outputs are 1s. So the output seems to be based on the coordinates of the cell. For example, maybe the value is 2 if the cell is in a certain range of rows and columns, and 1 otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by how many times the input has a 5 in that cell's row or column. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output, the cell (8,8) is 2, which is on the main diagonal. But the input cell (8,8) is 0, right? Wait, in example 3's input, the cell (8,8) is 0. But the output is 2. So the value is not directly based on the input cell's value.\n\nTherefore, the output is based on the input's 5s and their neighborhoods, but there's a specific rule that determines whether a cell is 1 or 2.\n\nMaybe the value is 2 if the cell is in a certain \"coloring\" pattern, like the diagonal parity. For example, cells where i + j is even \u2192 2, and odd \u2192 1. Let's test this:\n\nIn example 1's output:\n\n- cell (2,2): 2+2=4 even \u2192 2. Correct.\n- cell (8,1): 8+1=9 odd \u2192 1. Correct.\n- cell (0,2): 0+2=2 even"
