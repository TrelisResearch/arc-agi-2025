    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, there are two examples given. Let me look at them carefully.\n\nFirst example input is:\n3 3 8\n3 7 0\n5 0 0\n\nOutput is:\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n\nHmm. Let me write down the positions. Let's index rows and columns from 0 to 2.\n\nOriginal input:\nRow 0: [3, 3, 8]\nRow 1: [3, 7, 0]\nRow 2: [5, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: [0, 0, 5]\nRow 1: [0, 7, 3]\nRow 2: [8, 3, 3]\n\nLooking at each cell. Maybe there's some transformation based on positions. Let's see.\n\nFor example, the original cell (0,0) is 3. In the output, (0,0) is 0. Wait, but in the output row 2, column 0 is 8. Original (2,0) was 5. So maybe some kind of reversal or permutation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotated version. Let's check. Let's see the original input and output.\n\nOriginal input's row 0 is 3 3 8. Output row 0 is 0 0 5. Hmm, not sure. Let's check the output's row 2: 8 3 3. Original row 0 is 3 3 8. So maybe the output row 2 is the original row 0 reversed? Original row 0 is [3,3,8], reversed is [8,3,3], which matches output row 2. Similarly, output row 0 is [0,0,5]. Original row 2 is [5,0,0]. Reversed would be [0,0,5], which matches output row 0. So maybe the first and third rows are reversed. Then what about the middle row?\n\nOriginal row 1 is [3,7,0]. Output row 1 is [0,7,3]. Wait, that's the original row 1 reversed? Original row 1 is [3,7,0], reversed is [0,7,3]. Yes! So the output is the original grid reversed row-wise. So each row is reversed. But wait, the output rows are reversed. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,8] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [8,3,3] \u2192 which is output row 2.\n\nRow 1: [3,7,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,7,3] \u2192 output row 1.\n\nRow 2: [5,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,5] \u2192 output row 0.\n\nSo the output grid is the original grid's rows reversed. So the output grid is the original grid's rows in reverse order, and each row is reversed. Wait, no. Because the output rows are:\n\nOutput row 0 is [0,0,5], which is original row 2 reversed.\n\nOutput row 1 is [0,7,3], which is original row 1 reversed.\n\nOutput row 2 is [8,3,3], which is original row 0 reversed.\n\nSo the output grid is the original grid's rows reversed in order, and each row is reversed. So the entire grid is reversed both in rows and in each row. So the transformation is to reverse the rows and then reverse each row.\n\nBut let's check the second example.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n5 5 2\n1 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n2 5 5\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [5,5,2] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [2,5,5] \u2192 which is output row 2.\n\nRow 1: [1,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,1] \u2192 output row 1.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,0] \u2192 output row 0.\n\nSo the output grid is the original rows reversed, and each row is reversed. So the output is the original grid's rows reversed, and each row is reversed. So the transformation is to reverse the order of the rows and then reverse each row.\n\nSo the process is: for each row in the original grid, reverse it, then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nWait, let me check. For example 1, original rows are:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,8] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [8,3,3]\n\nRow 1: [3,7,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,7,3]\n\nRow 2: [5,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nThen, the output rows are [0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3]. Which is the reversed order of the reversed rows. So the original rows are reversed in order, then each row is reversed. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nOriginal rows are row 0, row 1, row 2. After reversing the order of rows, the rows become row 2, row 1, row 0. Then, each row is reversed. So row 2 becomes [0,0,5] (original row 2 is [5,0,0], reversed is [0,0,5]). Then row 1 is [3,7,0] reversed is [0,7,3]. Then row 0 is [3,3,8] reversed is [8,3,3]. So the output is:\n\n[0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3], which matches the first example's output.\n\nSo the transformation is: reverse the order of the rows, then reverse each row.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Reverse the order of the rows (so row 2 becomes first, row 1 second, row 0 third).\n\n2. For each row in this new order, reverse the elements in the row.\n\nSo for the first example, the input is:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,8]\n\nRow 1: [3,7,0]\n\nRow 2: [5,0,0]\n\nReverse the order of rows \u2192 rows become [row2, row1, row0].\n\nThen reverse each row:\n\nrow2 \u2192 [5,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nrow1 \u2192 [3,7,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,7,3]\n\nrow0 \u2192 [3,3,8] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [8,3,3]\n\nSo the output is:\n\n[0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3], which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for example 2:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow0: [5,5,2]\n\nRow1: [1,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nReverse rows \u2192 [row2, row1, row0]\n\nThen reverse each row:\n\nrow2 \u2192 [0,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nrow1 \u2192 [1,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,1]\n\nrow0 \u2192 [5,5,2] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [2,5,5]\n\nSo output is:\n\n[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [2,5,5], which matches the example 2's output.\n\nSo the transformation is to reverse the order of the rows and then reverse each row.\n\nSo the code would take the input grid, reverse the rows, then reverse each row.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest input is:\n\n6 3 5\n\n6 8 0\n\n4 0 0\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: [6,3,5]\n\nRow1: [6,8,0]\n\nRow2: [4,0,0]\n\nReverse the rows \u2192 [row2, row1, row0]\n\nThen reverse each row:\n\nrow2 \u2192 [4,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,4]\n\nrow1 \u2192 [6,8,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,8,6]\n\nrow0 \u2192 [6,3,5] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [5,3,6]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,4], [0,8,6], [5,3,6]\n\nBut wait, let me check. The output grid would be:\n\nFirst row (original row2 reversed): [0,0,4]\n\nSecond row (original row1 reversed): [0,8,6]\n\nThird row (original row0 reversed): [5,3,6]\n\nSo the transformed grid is:\n\n0 0 4\n\n0 8 6\n\n5 3 6\n\nBut let me check if that's the correct pattern.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n\n    # reverse the rows\n\n    reversed_rows = grid[::-1]\n\n    # reverse each row\n\n    transformed = [row[::-1] for row in reversed_rows]\n\n    return transformed\n\nYes. So that's the code.\n\nBut let's check for example 1. The input grid is:\n\nOriginal grid is:\n\n[[3,3,8], [3,7,0], [5,0,0]]\n\nreversed_rows is [[5,0,0], [3,7,0], [3,3,8]]\n\nthen each row is reversed:\n\n[0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3], which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct transformation.\n\nSo the Python code would be as described.\n\nSo the function would take the grid, reverse the rows, then reverse each row.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse the rows\n    reversed_rows = grid[::-1]\n    # Reverse each row\n    transformed = [row[::-1] for row in reversed_rows]\n    return transformed\n\nYes, that's the code. Let me check the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow0: [6,3,5]\n\nRow1: [6,8,0]\n\nRow2: [4,0,0]\n\nReversed rows: [row2, row1, row0] \u2192 [[4,0,0], [6,8,0], [6,3,5]]\n\nThen each row reversed:\n\n[0,0,4], [0,8,6], [5,3,6]\n\nSo the output grid is:\n\n0 0 4\n\n0 8 6\n\n5 3 6\n\nWhich is the transformed grid.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n"

Let me look at them carefully.\n\nFirst example input is:\n3 3 8\n3 7 0\n5 0 0\n\nOutput is:\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n\nHmm. Let me write down the positions. Let's index rows and columns from 0 to 2.\n\nOriginal input:\nRow 0: [3, 3, 8]\nRow 1: [3, 7, 0]\nRow 2: [5, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: [0, 0, 5]\nRow 1: [0, 7, 3]\nRow 2: [8, 3, 3]\n\nLooking at each cell. Maybe there's some transformation based on positions. Let's see.\n\nFor example, the original cell (0,0) is 3. In the output, (0,0) is 0. Wait, but in the output row 2, column 0 is 8. Original (2,0) was 5. So maybe some kind of reversal or permutation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotated version. Let's check. Let's see the original input and output.\n\nOriginal input's row 0 is 3 3 8. Output row 0 is 0 0 5. Hmm, not sure. Let's check the output's row 2: 8 3 3. Original row 0 is 3 3 8. So maybe the output row 2 is the original row 0 reversed? Original row 0 is [3,3,8], reversed is [8,3,3], which matches output row 2. Similarly, output row 0 is [0,0,5]. Original row 2 is [5,0,0]. Reversed would be [0,0,5], which matches output row 0. So maybe the first and third rows are reversed. Then what about the middle row?\n\nOriginal row 1 is [3,7,0]. Output row 1 is [0,7,3]. Wait, that's the original row 1 reversed? Original row 1 is [3,7,0], reversed is [0,7,3]. Yes! So the output is the original grid reversed row-wise. So each row is reversed. But wait, the output rows are reversed. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,8] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [8,3,3] \u2192 which is output row 2.\n\nRow 1: [3,7,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,7,3] \u2192 output row 1.\n\nRow 2: [5,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,5] \u2192 output row 0.\n\nSo the output grid is the original grid's rows reversed. So the output grid is the original grid's rows in reverse order, and each row is reversed. Wait, no. Because the output rows are:\n\nOutput row 0 is [0,0,5], which is original row 2 reversed.\n\nOutput row 1 is [0,7,3], which is original row 1 reversed.\n\nOutput row 2 is [8,3,3], which is original row 0 reversed.\n\nSo the output grid is the original grid's rows reversed in order, and each row is reversed. So the entire grid is reversed both in rows and in each row. So the transformation is to reverse the rows and then reverse each row.\n\nBut let's check the second example.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n5 5 2\n1 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n2 5 5\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [5,5,2] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [2,5,5] \u2192 which is output row 2.\n\nRow 1: [1,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,1] \u2192 output row 1.\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,0] \u2192 output row 0.\n\nSo the output grid is the original rows reversed, and each row is reversed. So the output is the original grid's rows reversed, and each row is reversed. So the transformation is to reverse the order of the rows and then reverse each row.\n\nSo the process is: for each row in the original grid, reverse it, then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nWait, let me check. For example 1, original rows are:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,8] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [8,3,3]\n\nRow 1: [3,7,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,7,3]\n\nRow 2: [5,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nThen, the output rows are [0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3]. Which is the reversed order of the reversed rows. So the original rows are reversed in order, then each row is reversed. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nOriginal rows are row 0, row 1, row 2. After reversing the order of rows, the rows become row 2, row 1, row 0. Then, each row is reversed. So row 2 becomes [0,0,5] (original row 2 is [5,0,0], reversed is [0,0,5]). Then row 1 is [3,7,0] reversed is [0,7,3]. Then row 0 is [3,3,8] reversed is [8,3,3]. So the output is:\n\n[0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3], which matches the first example's output.\n\nSo the transformation is: reverse the order of the rows, then reverse each row.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Reverse the order of the rows (so row 2 becomes first, row 1 second, row 0 third).\n\n2. For each row in this new order, reverse the elements in the row.\n\nSo for the first example, the input is:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,8]\n\nRow 1: [3,7,0]\n\nRow 2: [5,0,0]\n\nReverse the order of rows \u2192 rows become [row2, row1, row0].\n\nThen reverse each row:\n\nrow2 \u2192 [5,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nrow1 \u2192 [3,7,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,7,3]\n\nrow0 \u2192 [3,3,8] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [8,3,3]\n\nSo the output is:\n\n[0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3], which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for example 2:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow0: [5,5,2]\n\nRow1: [1,0,0]\n\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nReverse rows \u2192 [row2, row1, row0]\n\nThen reverse each row:\n\nrow2 \u2192 [0,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nrow1 \u2192 [1,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,1]\n\nrow0 \u2192 [5,5,2] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [2,5,5]\n\nSo output is:\n\n[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [2,5,5], which matches the example 2's output.\n\nSo the transformation is to reverse the order of the rows and then reverse each row.\n\nSo the code would take the input grid, reverse the rows, then reverse each row.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest input is:\n\n6 3 5\n\n6 8 0\n\n4 0 0\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: [6,3,5]\n\nRow1: [6,8,0]\n\nRow2: [4,0,0]\n\nReverse the rows \u2192 [row2, row1, row0]\n\nThen reverse each row:\n\nrow2 \u2192 [4,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,4]\n\nrow1 \u2192 [6,8,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,8,6]\n\nrow0 \u2192 [6,3,5] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [5,3,6]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[0,0,4], [0,8,6], [5,3,6]\n\nBut wait, let me check. The output grid would be:\n\nFirst row (original row2 reversed): [0,0,4]\n\nSecond row (original row1 reversed): [0,8,6]\n\nThird row (original row0 reversed): [5,3,6]\n\nSo the transformed grid is:\n\n0 0 4\n\n0 8 6\n\n5 3 6\n\nBut let me check if that's the correct pattern.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n\n    # reverse the rows\n\n    reversed_rows = grid[::-1]\n\n    # reverse each row\n\n    transformed = [row[::-1] for row in reversed_rows]\n\n    return transformed\n\nYes. So that's the code.\n\nBut let's check for example 1. The input grid is:\n\nOriginal grid is:\n\n[[3,3,8], [3,7,0], [5,0,0]]\n\nreversed_rows is [[5,0,0], [3,7,0], [3,3,8]]\n\nthen each row is reversed:\n\n[0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3], which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct transformation.\n\nSo the Python code would be as described.\n\nSo the function would take the grid, reverse the rows, then reverse each row.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse the rows\n    reversed_rows = grid[::-1]\n    # Reverse each row\n    transformed = [row[::-1] for row in reversed_rows]\n    return transformed\n\nYes, that's the code. Let me check the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow0: [6,3,5]\n\nRow1: [6,8,0]\n\nRow2: [4,0,0]\n\nReversed rows: [row2, row1, row0] \u2192 [[4,0,0], [6,8,0], [6,3,5]]\n\nThen each row reversed:\n\n[0,0,4], [0,8,6], [5,3,6]\n\nSo the output grid is:\n\n0 0 4\n\n0 8 6\n\n5 3 6\n\nWhich is the transformed grid.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n"
