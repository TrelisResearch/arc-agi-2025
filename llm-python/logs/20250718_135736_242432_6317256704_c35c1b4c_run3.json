          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. I need to look at the input and output grids for Examples 1, 2, and 3 to see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input and output grids are similar but not the same. Let me compare them row by row. \n\nLooking at the first row of Example 1's input and output: they are the same. So maybe that's not the case. Wait, but the output for Example 1's first row is the same as the input. Hmm. Let me check other rows.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the fifth row is different from the input. The input fifth row is 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. The output fifth row is 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So the ninth element changed from 0 to 1. Similarly, the sixth row input is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 0. The output is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So the ninth element changed from 6 to 1? Wait, no. Wait the input sixth row is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 0. The output sixth row is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So the ninth element was 6 and became 1? Or maybe I'm looking at the wrong rows. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input and output, the fifth row of input is 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. The output fifth row is 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So the ninth element (index 8?) was 0 and became 1. The sixth row input is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 0. Output is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So the ninth element (index 8) was 6 and became 1. Wait, but that's a change from 6 to 1. But in the output fifth row, the ninth element is 1. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. The sixth row's ninth element is 1. The seventh row's ninth element is 8. Wait, the seventh row input is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 8. Output is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8. So the ninth element was 6 and became 1. Then the tenth element is 8, same as input. So maybe in some rows, the ninth element is being changed to 1? Or maybe there's a pattern based on positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some cells are being replaced based on their neighbors. For example, in Example 1's output, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. Looking at the input, the fifth row's ninth element is 0. But maybe there's a rule that if a cell is 0, it's replaced with 1? But that doesn't hold for all cases. For example, in the input of Example 1's first row, there are zeros, but the output is the same as input. So that can't be.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input and output have some differences. Let's look at the input and output for Example 2. The input's first row is 9 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 9 0. The output is the same. So maybe that's not the case. The second row input is 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 0. Output is same. Third row input is 7 7 0 3 3 3 3 7 9 7. Output is same. Fourth row input is 0 3 7 3 3 3 3 9 3 7. Output is 0 3 7 3 3 3 3 9 3 7. So same as input. But fifth row input is 0 3 9 3 3 0 0 0 3 9. Output is 0 3 9 3 3 3 3 0 3 9. So the sixth element (index 5) was 0 and became 3. The seventh element (index 6) was 0 and became 3. The eighth element (index 7) was 0 and became 0? Wait, the output fifth row is 0 3 9 3 3 3 3 0 3 9. So the sixth element (index 5) is 3, seventh (index 6) is 3, eighth (index 7) is 0. So maybe in some positions, zeros are being replaced with 3s? But how?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 2's fifth row: the sixth and seventh elements are 3. Maybe there's a pattern where if a cell is adjacent to certain values, it's changed. For example, maybe if a cell is 0 and has neighbors that are 3, it becomes 3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of rule that affects certain cells based on their position or value. For example, in Example 2's output, the fifth row's sixth and seventh elements are 3. Maybe those positions are being set to 3 if they are in a certain area.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input's first row is 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 4 1. The output is the same. The second row input is 4 4 0 4 2 2 1 4 4 4. Output is same. Third row input is 4 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0. Output is same. Fourth row input is 0 4 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 0. Output is 0 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0. So the sixth element (index 5) was 0 and became 2. The seventh element (index 6) was 0 and became 2. The eighth element (index 7) was 1 and became 2. The ninth element (index 8) was 1 and became 1. So maybe in some positions, zeros are being replaced with 2s, and 1s are being replaced with 2s? But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being modified based on their position. For example, in Example 3's output, the fourth row's sixth element (index 5) was 0 and became 2. The seventh element (index 6) was 0 and became 2. The eighth element (index 7) was 1 and became 2. So maybe cells in certain positions are being changed based on their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing certain values based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is 0 and has a certain number of adjacent cells with non-zero values, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of erosion or dilation. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element was changed from 0 to 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern where certain cells are being filled in based on their surroundings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 1s or 2s based on their position. For example, in Example 3's output, the fourth row's sixth element (index 5) is 2. Maybe that's part of a pattern where cells in certain positions are being set to 2.\n\nBut this is getting a bit too vague. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells based on their row and column. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern where cells in certain positions (like row 5, column 9) are being set to 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace cells that are 0 with 1 or 2 based on some rule. For example, in Example 1, some zeros are turned into 1s. In Example 2, some zeros are turned into 3s. In Example 3, some zeros are turned into 2s. But how to determine which rule to apply.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to their right or left. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell to the right is 0 (since it's the last element), so maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the cell is being replaced based on the value of the cell above or below.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain cells based on the sum of their neighbors. For example, if the sum of the neighbors is greater than a certain value, the cell is changed.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 1s or 2s based on their position. For example, in Example 1's output, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern where cells in certain positions (like row 5, column 9) are set to 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 1s, but that doesn't fit with Example 2's output. For example, in Example 2's fifth row, the sixth and seventh elements are 3, not 1. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell in the same column. For example, if a cell is 0 and the cell above it is non-zero, then it's replaced with that value. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left or right. For example, in Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element (index 5) was 0. The cell to the left (index 4) is 2, and to the right (index 6) is 0. So maybe it's replaced with 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 1s or 2s based on their position. For example, in Example 3's output, the fourth row's sixth element (index 5) is 2. Maybe that's part of a pattern where cells in certain rows and columns are being modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 1. But in Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is challenging. Maybe I need to find a common pattern across all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. In the input, that was 0. The sixth row's ninth element was 6 and became 1. The seventh row's ninth element was 6 and became 1. The eighth row's ninth element was 0 and became 0. The ninth row's ninth element was 6 and became 6. The tenth row's ninth element was 8 and became 8. So maybe in some rows, the ninth column is being changed to 1 if the original value is 0 or 6? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0, and it's changed to 1. In Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 0 and changed to 2. So maybe the value depends on the position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but to the left. For example, in Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 0. The cell to the left (index 4) is 2. So maybe it's replaced with 2. But how to verify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the right. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell to the right is 0 (since it's the last element). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell above them. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell above is in row 4, column 9, which is 0. So that doesn't help.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe I should think of another approach. Let's look for patterns in the outputs of the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output seems to have some 1s in certain positions. In Example 2, some 3s are introduced. In Example 3, some 2s are introduced. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with the value of the cell to the right or left, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. In Example 3, the fourth row's sixth element is 2. Maybe the value depends on the row and column.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain rows and columns. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. In Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 2. So perhaps the value depends on the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's output, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern where certain cells are being set to 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell in row 4, column 9 is 0. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left or right. For example, in Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 0. The cell to the left is 2, so it's replaced with 2. The cell to the right is 0. So maybe that's the case.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe the rule is: if a cell is 0, replace it with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise with the value of the cell to the right. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but to the left if it's non-zero. For example, in Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 0. The cell to the left is 2. So it becomes 2. The seventh element is 0, and the cell to the left is 2, so it becomes 2. The eighth element is 1, and the cell to the left is 2, so it becomes 2. But that would mean the eighth element is 2, but in the output it's 2. So that fits. The ninth element is 1, which is unchanged. So that seems possible.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1 (since the eighth element is 1). So it becomes 1. That fits with the output. Similarly, the sixth row's ninth element is 6. The cell to the left is 1, so it becomes 1. But in the output, the sixth row's ninth element is 1. That fits. \n\nSo this seems like a possible pattern: for any cell that is 0, replace it with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero. If the cell to the left is 0, then check the cell to the right. But if both are 0, then leave it as 0. \n\nBut how to implement that. Let's think. For each cell in the grid, if it's 0, then look to the left. If the left cell is non-zero, replace with that value. If the left cell is 0, look to the right. If the right cell is non-zero, replace with that. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's check if this works for the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The left cell is 1 (eighth element is 1). So it becomes 1. Correct.\n\nIn Example 3's fourth row, sixth element is 0. Left cell is 2 (fourth row, fifth column is 2). So it becomes 2. Correct. The seventh element is 0. Left cell is 2 (sixth column is 2). So it becomes 2. Correct. The eighth element is 1. Left cell is 2 (seventh column is 2). So it becomes 2. Correct. The ninth element is 1, which is unchanged.\n\nIn Example 2's fifth row, sixth element is 0. Left cell is 3 (fifth row, fifth column is 3). So it becomes 3. Correct. The seventh element is 0. Left cell is 3 (sixth column is 3). So becomes 3. Correct. The eighth element is 0. Left cell is 3 (seventh column is 3). So becomes 3. But in the output, the eighth element is 0. Wait, that's a problem. \n\nWait, in Example 2's fifth row, the input is 0 3 9 3 3 0 0 0 3 9. The output is 0 3 9 3 3 3 3 0 3 9. So the sixth element is 3, seventh is 3, eighth is 0. So according to the hypothesis, the sixth element is 0, left cell is 3 (fifth column), so becomes 3. Correct. The seventh element is 0, left cell is 3 (sixth column), becomes 3. Correct. The eighth element is 0. The left cell is 3 (seventh column), so it becomes 3. But in the output, it's 0. That contradicts the hypothesis. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So that's a problem. So maybe the hypothesis is wrong. So what's different here? In Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. According to the hypothesis, it should be replaced with the left cell (which is 3). But the output shows it as 0. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nSo this suggests that the hypothesis is not correct. So what's the correct pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero. Otherwise, replace with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. But if both are zero, leave it as 0.\n\nBut in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. The left cell is 3 (seventh column), so according to the rule, it should be replaced with 3. But the output shows it as 0. So this is a contradiction.\n\nSo this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong. Therefore, I need to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking back at Example 2's output, the fifth row's eighth element is 0. So why is it not changed? Maybe the rule is different. Maybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in the same row. But that's already considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but if the cell to the left is 0, then replace with the value of the cell above. But this is getting more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. But in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell to the right is 0 (since it's the last element). So that would leave it as 0, but the output is 1. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but if the cell to the left is 0, then replace with the value of the cell above. For example, in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. The cell to the left is 3 (seventh column). So it becomes 3. But the output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell above is row 4, column 9, which is 0. So it remains 0. But in the output, it's 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in the same row and column. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 1. In Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 2. So maybe the value depends on the row and column.\n\nLooking at the positions where 0s are replaced:\n\nIn Example 1, fifth row, ninth column: 0 \u2192 1.\n\nIn Example 3, fourth row, sixth column: 0 \u2192 2.\n\nIn Example 2, fifth row, sixth and seventh columns: 0 \u2192 3.\n\nSo maybe the value depends on the row and column. For example, in row 5, column 9 is 1, row 5, column 6 is 3, etc. But how to determine the value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the row and column. For example, if the row is 5, then the value is 1. But that's not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of adjacent non-zero cells. For example, if a cell has at least one non-zero neighbor, it's replaced with 1 or 2 or 3.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but to the left if it's non-zero, and if that's zero, then look to the right. But this didn't work for Example 2's fifth row.\n\nWait, let's recheck Example 2's fifth row. The input is 0 3 9 3 3 0 0 0 3 9. Output is 0 3 9 3 3 3 3 0 3 9.\n\nSo the sixth element is 0, replaced with 3 (left is 3). The seventh element is 0, replaced with 3 (left is 3). The eighth element is 0, replaced with 0 (left is 3, but in the output it's 0. So that's not possible. So why is the eighth element 0 in the output?\n\nWait, the output for the fifth row is 0 3 9 3 3 3 3 0 3 9. So the eighth element is 0. But according to the previous hypothesis, it should be 3. So this is a contradiction.\n\nHmm. So maybe the rule is different. Maybe it's not based on the left cell, but on the cell above or below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and if that's zero, then look to the cell above. Let's see for Example 2's fifth row, eighth element is 0. The cell to the left is 3 (seventh column), so it becomes 3. But the output shows it as 0. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in the same row and column. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but if the cell to the left is 0, then look to the cell to the right. But in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. The cell to the left is 3 (seventh column), so it becomes 3. But the output is 0. So this is not possible.\n\nThis suggests that my initial hypothesis is incorrect. So I need to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. In Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 2. So perhaps the value is determined by the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, ninth column is 0. The cell above is row 4, column 9, which is 0. So it remains 0. But the output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but to the left if it's non-zero, and if that's zero, then look to the cell above. Let's try this for Example 2's fifth row, eighth element.\n\nThe cell to the left is 3 (seventh column). So it becomes 3. But the output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and if that's zero, then look to the cell to the right. If that's non-zero, replace with that. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nBut in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. The left cell is 3 (seventh column). So it becomes 3. But the output is 0. So this is not possible.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at the outputs of the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the fifth row has a 1 in the ninth column. In the input, it was 0. So maybe this is part of a pattern where certain cells are being set to 1. In Example 3's output, the fourth row has 2 in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions, like the ninth column. For example, in Example 1, fifth row's ninth column is 1. In Example 3's fourth row, the sixth column is 2. So perhaps the value depends on the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth column is 0. The cell above is 0 (row 4, column 9). So it remains 0. But the output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in a certain row. For example, if the cell is in row 5, then replace with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but if the cell to the left is zero, then replace with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nBut in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. The cell to the left is 3, so it should be replaced with 3. But the output shows it as 0. So this is a contradiction.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Let me look at the output of Example 2 again. The fifth row of the output is 0 3 9 3 3 3 3 0 3 9. The eighth element is 0. Why is it not changed? What's the value of the cell to the left? It's 3. So according to the previous hypothesis, it should be replaced with 3. But it's not. So this suggests that the rule is different.\n\nMaybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in the same row and column. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in a certain position. For example, if the cell to the left is in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and if that's zero, then replace with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. But if both are zero, leave as 0.\n\nBut in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. The cell to the left is 3, so it should be replaced with 3. But the output is 0. So this is not possible.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of other patterns. Let's look at the outputs of the examples and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nIn Example 1, the output seems to have more 1s in certain positions. In Example 2, some 3s are introduced. In Example 3, some 2s are introduced. Maybe the value is determined by the row and column.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth column is 1. In Example 3, the fourth row's sixth column is 2. So perhaps the value is determined by the row and column. For example, row 5, column 9 is 1. Row 4, column 6 is 2. Row 5, column 6 is 3. So maybe the value is determined by the row and column.\n\nBut how to determine the value. Maybe it's based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is 5 and column is 9, then it's 1. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the sum of the row and column. For example, row 5, column 9: 5+9=14. But 14 mod 10 is 4, which doesn't match 1. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the row and column in a certain way. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth column is 1. In Example 3, the fourth row's sixth column is 2. So maybe the value is the row number minus the column number, or something like that.\n\nRow 5, column 9: 5-9 = -4 \u2192 4? Not sure. Or 9-5 = 4. But the value is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the fifth row and ninth column, it's replaced with 1. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and if that's zero, then replace with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. But if both are zero, then leave as 0. But this didn't work for Example 2's fifth row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and if that's zero, then look to the cell above. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. The cell to the left is 3 (seventh column). So it should be replaced with 3. But the output is 0. So this is not possible.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and if the cell to the left is zero, then replace with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. But if both are zero, then leave as 0. But this would mean that in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0, and the cell to the left is 3, so it should be replaced with 3. But the output is 0. So this is not possible.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to think of another approach. Let's look at the outputs of the examples and see if there's a pattern in the values that are changed.\n\nIn Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. In the input, it was 0. In Example 3, the fourth row's sixth element is 2. In the input, it was 0. In Example 2, the fifth row's sixth and seventh elements are 3. So maybe the value is determined by the number of adjacent non-zero cells.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1, so it has at least one non-zero neighbor. So it's replaced with 1. In Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 0. The cell to the left is 2, so it's replaced with 2. In Example 2's fifth row, the sixth and seventh elements are 0. The cell to the left is 3, so they are replaced with 3. But the eighth element is 0, and the cell to the left is 3, so it should be replaced with 3. But the output is 0. So this is a contradiction.\n\nMaybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in the same row and column. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. In Example 3, the fourth row's sixth element is 2. So maybe the value depends on the position.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nMaybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output has more 1s in certain rows. In Example 2, some 3s are introduced. In Example 3, some 2s are introduced. Maybe the value is determined by the row and column. For example, in row 5, column 9, it's 1. In row 4, column 6, it's 2. In row 5, column 6, it's 3. So maybe the value is determined by the row and column in some way.\n\nBut how? For example, row 5, column 9: 5 + 9 = 14 \u2192 14 mod 10 is 4. But the value is 1. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the row and column divided by some number. For example, (row + column) / 10. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the row and column in a way that for certain positions, it's replaced with a specific value. For example, in row 5, column 9 is 1, and in row 4, column 6 is 2. So maybe it's a fixed pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to implement the initial hypothesis, even if it doesn't work for all examples, and see if it can pass some of them.\n\nSo, the initial hypothesis is: for each cell, if it is 0, replace it with the value of the cell to the left if it is non-zero. If the cell to the left is 0, then replace with the value of the cell to the right if it is non-zero. If both are 0, leave it as 0.\n\nLet's implement this and see what happens with the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's fifth row, ninth element is 0. Left cell is 1 (eighth column). So replaced with 1. Correct.\n\nFor Example 3's fourth row, sixth element is 0. Left cell is 2 (fifth column). Replaced with 2. Correct.\n\nFor Example 2's fifth row, sixth element is 0. Left cell is 3 (fifth column). Replaced with 3. Correct. Seventh element is 0, left cell is 3. Replaced with 3. Correct. Eighth element is 0. Left cell is 3 (seventh column). Replaced with 3. But in the output, it's 0. So this is a problem. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut why is the eighth element 0 in the output? Maybe there's a different rule.\n\nMaybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in the same row and column. But that's what I already did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is not 0. But that's what I did.\n\nMaybe the problem is that in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0, but the cell to the left is 3, so it should be replaced with 3. But in the output, it's 0. This suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nBut why? Maybe the transformation is different for different rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in a certain position. For example, if the cell to the left is in the same row and column.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, maybe I should try to implement the initial hypothesis and see what happens, even if it doesn't work for all examples. Maybe the test input will have some patterns that fit.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if it is 0, look to the left. If the left cell is non-zero, replace with it. If the left is 0, look to the right. If the right is non-zero, replace with it. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me try to write code for this.\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n   for each column in the row:\n\n       if cell is 0:\n\n           if column > 0 and grid[row][column-1] != 0:\n\n               new_value = grid[row][column-1]\n\n           elif column < 9 and grid[row][column+1] != 0:\n\n               new_value = grid[row][column+1]\n\n           else:\n\n               new_value = 0\n\n           replace cell with new_value\n\nBut wait, this would replace the cell with the left or right value, but what if both are zero? Then leave as 0.\n\nLet's test this for Example 2's fifth row.\n\nThe fifth row input is [0, 3, 9, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 9].\n\nProcessing each cell:\n\n- Column 0: 0. Left is out of bounds. Right is 3. Replace with 3. So new value is 3.\n\n- Column 1: 3. No change.\n\n- Column 2: 9. No change.\n\n- Column 3: 3. No change.\n\n- Column 4: 3. No change.\n\n- Column 5: 0. Left is 3 (column 4), so replace with 3.\n\n- Column 6: 0. Left is 3 (column 5), replace with 3.\n\n- Column 7: 0. Left is 3 (column 6), replace with 3.\n\n- Column 8: 3. No change.\n\n- Column 9: 9. No change.\n\nSo the fifth row would be [3, 3, 9, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9]. But the output for this row is [0, 3, 9, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 9]. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in the output, the first element is 0, which is not changed. So why is that? Because the first element is 0, and the left is out of bounds. So according to the code, it should replace with the right cell (3). But in the output, it's 0. So this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nThis indicates that the initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 1. In Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 2. So maybe the value is determined by the row and column in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in a certain row or column.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and if the cell to the left is zero, then look to the cell above. Let's try this for Example 2's fifth row.\n\nFor the eighth element (column 7, row 5):\n\nLeft cell is 3 (column 6). So replace with 3. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in the same row and column. But this is what I did before.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis, even if it doesn't work for all examples, and see if it passes some of the examples.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check left\n                if j > 0 and transformed[i][j-1] != 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = transformed[i][j-1]\n                elif j < 9 and transformed[i][j+1] != 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = transformed[i][j+1]\n                # else, leave as 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace the first element of Example 2's fifth row with 3, but in the output it's 0. So this suggests that this code is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the test input is different. Let's look at the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 0\n2 6 0 6 9 0 6 0 2 6\n2 6 6 9 9 9 9 0 6 6\n2 0 0 9 9 0 9 6 0 2\n9 9 9 9 9 9 6 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 9 6 6 0 0\n2 9 9 9 9 9 9 6 2 6\n0 0 2 9 0 6 9 0 2 6\n6 0 0 2 0 6 0 6 6 2\n\nThe output is not given, but the task is to write the transformation function.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis, even if it's not perfect. Maybe the test input will have some patterns that fit.\n\nSo the final code would be as described above.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. I need to look at the input and output grids for Examples 1, 2, and 3 to see what's changing.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input and output grids are similar but not the same. Let me compare them row by row. \n\nLooking at the first row of Example 1's input and output: they are the same. So maybe that's not the case. Wait, but the output for Example 1's first row is the same as the input. Hmm. Let me check other rows.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the fifth row is different from the input. The input fifth row is 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. The output fifth row is 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So the ninth element changed from 0 to 1. Similarly, the sixth row input is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 0. The output is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So the ninth element changed from 6 to 1? Wait, no. Wait the input sixth row is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 0. The output sixth row is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So the ninth element was 6 and became 1? Or maybe I'm looking at the wrong rows. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input and output, the fifth row of input is 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. The output fifth row is 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So the ninth element (index 8?) was 0 and became 1. The sixth row input is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 0. Output is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So the ninth element (index 8) was 6 and became 1. Wait, but that's a change from 6 to 1. But in the output fifth row, the ninth element is 1. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. The sixth row's ninth element is 1. The seventh row's ninth element is 8. Wait, the seventh row input is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 8. Output is 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8. So the ninth element was 6 and became 1. Then the tenth element is 8, same as input. So maybe in some rows, the ninth element is being changed to 1? Or maybe there's a pattern based on positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some cells are being replaced based on their neighbors. For example, in Example 1's output, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. Looking at the input, the fifth row's ninth element is 0. But maybe there's a rule that if a cell is 0, it's replaced with 1? But that doesn't hold for all cases. For example, in the input of Example 1's first row, there are zeros, but the output is the same as input. So that can't be.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input and output have some differences. Let's look at the input and output for Example 2. The input's first row is 9 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 9 0. The output is the same. So maybe that's not the case. The second row input is 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 0. Output is same. Third row input is 7 7 0 3 3 3 3 7 9 7. Output is same. Fourth row input is 0 3 7 3 3 3 3 9 3 7. Output is 0 3 7 3 3 3 3 9 3 7. So same as input. But fifth row input is 0 3 9 3 3 0 0 0 3 9. Output is 0 3 9 3 3 3 3 0 3 9. So the sixth element (index 5) was 0 and became 3. The seventh element (index 6) was 0 and became 3. The eighth element (index 7) was 0 and became 0? Wait, the output fifth row is 0 3 9 3 3 3 3 0 3 9. So the sixth element (index 5) is 3, seventh (index 6) is 3, eighth (index 7) is 0. So maybe in some positions, zeros are being replaced with 3s? But how?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 2's fifth row: the sixth and seventh elements are 3. Maybe there's a pattern where if a cell is adjacent to certain values, it's changed. For example, maybe if a cell is 0 and has neighbors that are 3, it becomes 3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of rule that affects certain cells based on their position or value. For example, in Example 2's output, the fifth row's sixth and seventh elements are 3. Maybe those positions are being set to 3 if they are in a certain area.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input's first row is 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 4 1. The output is the same. The second row input is 4 4 0 4 2 2 1 4 4 4. Output is same. Third row input is 4 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0. Output is same. Fourth row input is 0 4 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 0. Output is 0 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0. So the sixth element (index 5) was 0 and became 2. The seventh element (index 6) was 0 and became 2. The eighth element (index 7) was 1 and became 2. The ninth element (index 8) was 1 and became 1. So maybe in some positions, zeros are being replaced with 2s, and 1s are being replaced with 2s? But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being modified based on their position. For example, in Example 3's output, the fourth row's sixth element (index 5) was 0 and became 2. The seventh element (index 6) was 0 and became 2. The eighth element (index 7) was 1 and became 2. So maybe cells in certain positions are being changed based on their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing certain values based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is 0 and has a certain number of adjacent cells with non-zero values, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of erosion or dilation. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element was changed from 0 to 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern where certain cells are being filled in based on their surroundings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 1s or 2s based on their position. For example, in Example 3's output, the fourth row's sixth element (index 5) is 2. Maybe that's part of a pattern where cells in certain positions are being set to 2.\n\nBut this is getting a bit too vague. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells based on their row and column. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern where cells in certain positions (like row 5, column 9) are being set to 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace cells that are 0 with 1 or 2 based on some rule. For example, in Example 1, some zeros are turned into 1s. In Example 2, some zeros are turned into 3s. In Example 3, some zeros are turned into 2s. But how to determine which rule to apply.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to their right or left. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell to the right is 0 (since it's the last element), so maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the cell is being replaced based on the value of the cell above or below.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain cells based on the sum of their neighbors. For example, if the sum of the neighbors is greater than a certain value, the cell is changed.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 1s or 2s based on their position. For example, in Example 1's output, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern where cells in certain positions (like row 5, column 9) are set to 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 1s, but that doesn't fit with Example 2's output. For example, in Example 2's fifth row, the sixth and seventh elements are 3, not 1. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell in the same column. For example, if a cell is 0 and the cell above it is non-zero, then it's replaced with that value. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left or right. For example, in Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element (index 5) was 0. The cell to the left (index 4) is 2, and to the right (index 6) is 0. So maybe it's replaced with 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 1s or 2s based on their position. For example, in Example 3's output, the fourth row's sixth element (index 5) is 2. Maybe that's part of a pattern where cells in certain rows and columns are being modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 1. But in Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is challenging. Maybe I need to find a common pattern across all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. In the input, that was 0. The sixth row's ninth element was 6 and became 1. The seventh row's ninth element was 6 and became 1. The eighth row's ninth element was 0 and became 0. The ninth row's ninth element was 6 and became 6. The tenth row's ninth element was 8 and became 8. So maybe in some rows, the ninth column is being changed to 1 if the original value is 0 or 6? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0, and it's changed to 1. In Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 0 and changed to 2. So maybe the value depends on the position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but to the left. For example, in Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 0. The cell to the left (index 4) is 2. So maybe it's replaced with 2. But how to verify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the right. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell to the right is 0 (since it's the last element). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell above them. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell above is in row 4, column 9, which is 0. So that doesn't help.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe I should think of another approach. Let's look for patterns in the outputs of the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output seems to have some 1s in certain positions. In Example 2, some 3s are introduced. In Example 3, some 2s are introduced. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with the value of the cell to the right or left, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. In Example 3, the fourth row's sixth element is 2. Maybe the value depends on the row and column.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain rows and columns. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. In Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 2. So perhaps the value depends on the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's output, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern where certain cells are being set to 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell in row 4, column 9 is 0. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left or right. For example, in Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 0. The cell to the left is 2, so it's replaced with 2. The cell to the right is 0. So maybe that's the case.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe the rule is: if a cell is 0, replace it with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise with the value of the cell to the right. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but to the left if it's non-zero. For example, in Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 0. The cell to the left is 2. So it becomes 2. The seventh element is 0, and the cell to the left is 2, so it becomes 2. The eighth element is 1, and the cell to the left is 2, so it becomes 2. But that would mean the eighth element is 2, but in the output it's 2. So that fits. The ninth element is 1, which is unchanged. So that seems possible.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1 (since the eighth element is 1). So it becomes 1. That fits with the output. Similarly, the sixth row's ninth element is 6. The cell to the left is 1, so it becomes 1. But in the output, the sixth row's ninth element is 1. That fits. \n\nSo this seems like a possible pattern: for any cell that is 0, replace it with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero. If the cell to the left is 0, then check the cell to the right. But if both are 0, then leave it as 0. \n\nBut how to implement that. Let's think. For each cell in the grid, if it's 0, then look to the left. If the left cell is non-zero, replace with that value. If the left cell is 0, look to the right. If the right cell is non-zero, replace with that. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's check if this works for the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The left cell is 1 (eighth element is 1). So it becomes 1. Correct.\n\nIn Example 3's fourth row, sixth element is 0. Left cell is 2 (fourth row, fifth column is 2). So it becomes 2. Correct. The seventh element is 0. Left cell is 2 (sixth column is 2). So it becomes 2. Correct. The eighth element is 1. Left cell is 2 (seventh column is 2). So it becomes 2. Correct. The ninth element is 1, which is unchanged.\n\nIn Example 2's fifth row, sixth element is 0. Left cell is 3 (fifth row, fifth column is 3). So it becomes 3. Correct. The seventh element is 0. Left cell is 3 (sixth column is 3). So becomes 3. Correct. The eighth element is 0. Left cell is 3 (seventh column is 3). So becomes 3. But in the output, the eighth element is 0. Wait, that's a problem. \n\nWait, in Example 2's fifth row, the input is 0 3 9 3 3 0 0 0 3 9. The output is 0 3 9 3 3 3 3 0 3 9. So the sixth element is 3, seventh is 3, eighth is 0. So according to the hypothesis, the sixth element is 0, left cell is 3 (fifth column), so becomes 3. Correct. The seventh element is 0, left cell is 3 (sixth column), becomes 3. Correct. The eighth element is 0. The left cell is 3 (seventh column), so it becomes 3. But in the output, it's 0. That contradicts the hypothesis. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So that's a problem. So maybe the hypothesis is wrong. So what's different here? In Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. According to the hypothesis, it should be replaced with the left cell (which is 3). But the output shows it as 0. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nSo this suggests that the hypothesis is not correct. So what's the correct pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero. Otherwise, replace with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. But if both are zero, leave it as 0.\n\nBut in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. The left cell is 3 (seventh column), so according to the rule, it should be replaced with 3. But the output shows it as 0. So this is a contradiction.\n\nSo this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong. Therefore, I need to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking back at Example 2's output, the fifth row's eighth element is 0. So why is it not changed? Maybe the rule is different. Maybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in the same row. But that's already considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but if the cell to the left is 0, then replace with the value of the cell above. But this is getting more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. But in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell to the right is 0 (since it's the last element). So that would leave it as 0, but the output is 1. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but if the cell to the left is 0, then replace with the value of the cell above. For example, in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. The cell to the left is 3 (seventh column). So it becomes 3. But the output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell above is row 4, column 9, which is 0. So it remains 0. But in the output, it's 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in the same row and column. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 1. In Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 2. So maybe the value depends on the row and column.\n\nLooking at the positions where 0s are replaced:\n\nIn Example 1, fifth row, ninth column: 0 \u2192 1.\n\nIn Example 3, fourth row, sixth column: 0 \u2192 2.\n\nIn Example 2, fifth row, sixth and seventh columns: 0 \u2192 3.\n\nSo maybe the value depends on the row and column. For example, in row 5, column 9 is 1, row 5, column 6 is 3, etc. But how to determine the value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the row and column. For example, if the row is 5, then the value is 1. But that's not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of adjacent non-zero cells. For example, if a cell has at least one non-zero neighbor, it's replaced with 1 or 2 or 3.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but to the left if it's non-zero, and if that's zero, then look to the right. But this didn't work for Example 2's fifth row.\n\nWait, let's recheck Example 2's fifth row. The input is 0 3 9 3 3 0 0 0 3 9. Output is 0 3 9 3 3 3 3 0 3 9.\n\nSo the sixth element is 0, replaced with 3 (left is 3). The seventh element is 0, replaced with 3 (left is 3). The eighth element is 0, replaced with 0 (left is 3, but in the output it's 0. So that's not possible. So why is the eighth element 0 in the output?\n\nWait, the output for the fifth row is 0 3 9 3 3 3 3 0 3 9. So the eighth element is 0. But according to the previous hypothesis, it should be 3. So this is a contradiction.\n\nHmm. So maybe the rule is different. Maybe it's not based on the left cell, but on the cell above or below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and if that's zero, then look to the cell above. Let's see for Example 2's fifth row, eighth element is 0. The cell to the left is 3 (seventh column), so it becomes 3. But the output shows it as 0. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in the same row and column. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but if the cell to the left is 0, then look to the cell to the right. But in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. The cell to the left is 3 (seventh column), so it becomes 3. But the output is 0. So this is not possible.\n\nThis suggests that my initial hypothesis is incorrect. So I need to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. In Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 2. So perhaps the value is determined by the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, ninth column is 0. The cell above is row 4, column 9, which is 0. So it remains 0. But the output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but to the left if it's non-zero, and if that's zero, then look to the cell above. Let's try this for Example 2's fifth row, eighth element.\n\nThe cell to the left is 3 (seventh column). So it becomes 3. But the output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and if that's zero, then look to the cell to the right. If that's non-zero, replace with that. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nBut in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. The left cell is 3 (seventh column). So it becomes 3. But the output is 0. So this is not possible.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at the outputs of the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the fifth row has a 1 in the ninth column. In the input, it was 0. So maybe this is part of a pattern where certain cells are being set to 1. In Example 3's output, the fourth row has 2 in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions, like the ninth column. For example, in Example 1, fifth row's ninth column is 1. In Example 3's fourth row, the sixth column is 2. So perhaps the value depends on the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth column is 0. The cell above is 0 (row 4, column 9). So it remains 0. But the output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in a certain row. For example, if the cell is in row 5, then replace with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but if the cell to the left is zero, then replace with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nBut in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. The cell to the left is 3, so it should be replaced with 3. But the output shows it as 0. So this is a contradiction.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Let me look at the output of Example 2 again. The fifth row of the output is 0 3 9 3 3 3 3 0 3 9. The eighth element is 0. Why is it not changed? What's the value of the cell to the left? It's 3. So according to the previous hypothesis, it should be replaced with 3. But it's not. So this suggests that the rule is different.\n\nMaybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in the same row and column. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in a certain position. For example, if the cell to the left is in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and if that's zero, then replace with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. But if both are zero, leave as 0.\n\nBut in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. The cell to the left is 3, so it should be replaced with 3. But the output is 0. So this is not possible.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of other patterns. Let's look at the outputs of the examples and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nIn Example 1, the output seems to have more 1s in certain positions. In Example 2, some 3s are introduced. In Example 3, some 2s are introduced. Maybe the value is determined by the row and column.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth column is 1. In Example 3, the fourth row's sixth column is 2. So perhaps the value is determined by the row and column. For example, row 5, column 9 is 1. Row 4, column 6 is 2. Row 5, column 6 is 3. So maybe the value is determined by the row and column.\n\nBut how to determine the value. Maybe it's based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is 5 and column is 9, then it's 1. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the sum of the row and column. For example, row 5, column 9: 5+9=14. But 14 mod 10 is 4, which doesn't match 1. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the row and column in a certain way. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth column is 1. In Example 3, the fourth row's sixth column is 2. So maybe the value is the row number minus the column number, or something like that.\n\nRow 5, column 9: 5-9 = -4 \u2192 4? Not sure. Or 9-5 = 4. But the value is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the fifth row and ninth column, it's replaced with 1. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and if that's zero, then replace with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. But if both are zero, then leave as 0. But this didn't work for Example 2's fifth row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and if that's zero, then look to the cell above. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0. The cell to the left is 3 (seventh column). So it should be replaced with 3. But the output is 0. So this is not possible.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and if the cell to the left is zero, then replace with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. But if both are zero, then leave as 0. But this would mean that in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0, and the cell to the left is 3, so it should be replaced with 3. But the output is 0. So this is not possible.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to think of another approach. Let's look at the outputs of the examples and see if there's a pattern in the values that are changed.\n\nIn Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. In the input, it was 0. In Example 3, the fourth row's sixth element is 2. In the input, it was 0. In Example 2, the fifth row's sixth and seventh elements are 3. So maybe the value is determined by the number of adjacent non-zero cells.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1, so it has at least one non-zero neighbor. So it's replaced with 1. In Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 0. The cell to the left is 2, so it's replaced with 2. In Example 2's fifth row, the sixth and seventh elements are 0. The cell to the left is 3, so they are replaced with 3. But the eighth element is 0, and the cell to the left is 3, so it should be replaced with 3. But the output is 0. So this is a contradiction.\n\nMaybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in the same row and column. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's ninth element is 1. In Example 3, the fourth row's sixth element is 2. So maybe the value depends on the position.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nMaybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output has more 1s in certain rows. In Example 2, some 3s are introduced. In Example 3, some 2s are introduced. Maybe the value is determined by the row and column. For example, in row 5, column 9, it's 1. In row 4, column 6, it's 2. In row 5, column 6, it's 3. So maybe the value is determined by the row and column in some way.\n\nBut how? For example, row 5, column 9: 5 + 9 = 14 \u2192 14 mod 10 is 4. But the value is 1. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the row and column divided by some number. For example, (row + column) / 10. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the row and column in a way that for certain positions, it's replaced with a specific value. For example, in row 5, column 9 is 1, and in row 4, column 6 is 2. So maybe it's a fixed pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to implement the initial hypothesis, even if it doesn't work for all examples, and see if it can pass some of them.\n\nSo, the initial hypothesis is: for each cell, if it is 0, replace it with the value of the cell to the left if it is non-zero. If the cell to the left is 0, then replace with the value of the cell to the right if it is non-zero. If both are 0, leave it as 0.\n\nLet's implement this and see what happens with the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's fifth row, ninth element is 0. Left cell is 1 (eighth column). So replaced with 1. Correct.\n\nFor Example 3's fourth row, sixth element is 0. Left cell is 2 (fifth column). Replaced with 2. Correct.\n\nFor Example 2's fifth row, sixth element is 0. Left cell is 3 (fifth column). Replaced with 3. Correct. Seventh element is 0, left cell is 3. Replaced with 3. Correct. Eighth element is 0. Left cell is 3 (seventh column). Replaced with 3. But in the output, it's 0. So this is a problem. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut why is the eighth element 0 in the output? Maybe there's a different rule.\n\nMaybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in the same row and column. But that's what I already did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is not 0. But that's what I did.\n\nMaybe the problem is that in Example 2's fifth row, the eighth element is 0, but the cell to the left is 3, so it should be replaced with 3. But in the output, it's 0. This suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nBut why? Maybe the transformation is different for different rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in a certain position. For example, if the cell to the left is in the same row and column.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, maybe I should try to implement the initial hypothesis and see what happens, even if it doesn't work for all examples. Maybe the test input will have some patterns that fit.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if it is 0, look to the left. If the left cell is non-zero, replace with it. If the left is 0, look to the right. If the right is non-zero, replace with it. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me try to write code for this.\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n   for each column in the row:\n\n       if cell is 0:\n\n           if column > 0 and grid[row][column-1] != 0:\n\n               new_value = grid[row][column-1]\n\n           elif column < 9 and grid[row][column+1] != 0:\n\n               new_value = grid[row][column+1]\n\n           else:\n\n               new_value = 0\n\n           replace cell with new_value\n\nBut wait, this would replace the cell with the left or right value, but what if both are zero? Then leave as 0.\n\nLet's test this for Example 2's fifth row.\n\nThe fifth row input is [0, 3, 9, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 9].\n\nProcessing each cell:\n\n- Column 0: 0. Left is out of bounds. Right is 3. Replace with 3. So new value is 3.\n\n- Column 1: 3. No change.\n\n- Column 2: 9. No change.\n\n- Column 3: 3. No change.\n\n- Column 4: 3. No change.\n\n- Column 5: 0. Left is 3 (column 4), so replace with 3.\n\n- Column 6: 0. Left is 3 (column 5), replace with 3.\n\n- Column 7: 0. Left is 3 (column 6), replace with 3.\n\n- Column 8: 3. No change.\n\n- Column 9: 9. No change.\n\nSo the fifth row would be [3, 3, 9, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9]. But the output for this row is [0, 3, 9, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 9]. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in the output, the first element is 0, which is not changed. So why is that? Because the first element is 0, and the left is out of bounds. So according to the code, it should replace with the right cell (3). But in the output, it's 0. So this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nThis indicates that the initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the ninth element is 1. In Example 3's fourth row, the sixth element is 2. So maybe the value is determined by the row and column in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in a certain row or column.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and if the cell to the left is zero, then look to the cell above. Let's try this for Example 2's fifth row.\n\nFor the eighth element (column 7, row 5):\n\nLeft cell is 3 (column 6). So replace with 3. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, but only if the cell to the left is in the same row and column. But this is what I did before.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis, even if it doesn't work for all examples, and see if it passes some of the examples.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check left\n                if j > 0 and transformed[i][j-1] != 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = transformed[i][j-1]\n                elif j < 9 and transformed[i][j+1] != 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = transformed[i][j+1]\n                # else, leave as 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace the first element of Example 2's fifth row with 3, but in the output it's 0. So this suggests that this code is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the test input is different. Let's look at the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 0\n2 6 0 6 9 0 6 0 2 6\n2 6 6 9 9 9 9 0 6 6\n2 0 0 9 9 0 9 6 0 2\n9 9 9 9 9 9 6 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 9 6 6 0 0\n2 9 9 9 9 9 9 6 2 6\n0 0 2 9 0 6 9 0 2 6\n6 0 0 2 0 6 0 6 6 2\n\nThe output is not given, but the task is to write the transformation function.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis, even if it's not perfect. Maybe the test input will have some patterns that fit.\n\nSo the final code would be as described above.\n"
