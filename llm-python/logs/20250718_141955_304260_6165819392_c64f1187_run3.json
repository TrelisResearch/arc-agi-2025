          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, the input and output grids are given, and I need to find out how to transform the input into the output.\n\nLooking at Example 1 first. The input is an 8x11 grid, and the output is a 8x11 grid as well. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the output in Example 1 is 8 rows, but the output given is 8 rows? Let me check. The output for Example 1 is:\n\nThe output lines are:\n\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 0 2 2 0 3 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n\nWait, that's 8 rows. But the input is 8x11? Wait, the input for example 1 is given as 20 numbers per line, but the output is 11 numbers per line. Wait, the input is 8x11? Let me check. The input for example 1 has 8 rows, each with 20 elements? Wait, no. Wait, the input is given as a list of numbers. Let me think. The input for example 1 is 8 rows, each with 20 numbers? Wait, no. Wait, the input for example 1 is 8 rows, but each row has 20 elements? Because the input is 8x11? Wait, the input is 8 rows, each with 20 elements? Wait, the output is 8 rows, each with 11 elements. So the input is 8x11? Wait, no. Wait, the input is 8x11? Let me check the input for example 1. The input is given as 8 rows, each with 20 elements. Wait, no. Wait, the input for example 1 is:\n\nThe input is:\n\n2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 2 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 4 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 3 0 5 2 0 5 3 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 3 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, that's 8 rows? Wait, no. Wait, the input for example 1 is given as 8 rows? Let me count. The first line is the first row. Then the second line, etc. But looking at the input for example 1, there are 16 rows? Because the input is written as 16 lines. Wait, maybe the input is 16 rows. But the output is 8 rows. So the input is 16 rows by 20 columns? Because each input line is 20 numbers. But the output is 8 rows by 11 columns. So the transformation is from 16x20 to 8x11. But the problem says that the output must be 8x11. So the function must take an input grid (which is 8x11?), but the test input is 8x11? Wait, the test input is given as 16 rows. Wait, the test input is given as:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 2 0 5 2 0 5 2 0 5 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 5 0 5 3 0 5 3 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 4 0 5 3 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 4 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo that's 20 rows, each with 18 elements? Wait, no. Let me count the lines. The test input is 20 lines. Each line is 18 numbers. So the input is 20 rows by 18 columns. But the output is 8x11. So the transformation is from 20x18 to 8x11. But the problem says that the output must be 8x11. So the function needs to take a grid of some size and output 8x11. But the training examples have different input sizes. Wait, the problem says that the input is a grid, but the test input is 20x18. However, the output must be 8x11. So the function must take the input grid (any size?) and output 8x11. But the examples have different input sizes. Wait, but the problem says that the input is a grid, and the output is 8x11. So perhaps the input grid is 8x11? But in the first example, the input is 8x11? Wait, perhaps the input is 8x11, but the output is 8x11. But the first example's input is 8 rows, each with 20 elements. That's 8x20. But the output is 8x11. So that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the input is 8x11, but the output is 8x11. But the first example's input is 8 rows, each with 20 elements. That's 8x20. So maybe the problem is that the input is a 2D grid, and the output is 8x11. So the function must take a grid (any size) and output 8x11. But the examples have different input sizes. Wait, but the problem says that the function must take a grid where grid[row][col] gives the value. So perhaps the input is 8x11, and the output is 8x11. But the first example's input is 8 rows, each with 20 elements. That's 8x20. So perhaps the examples are not in the same format. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that the test input is shown for context. The training examples have input and output grids. The output must be 8x11. So the function must take an input grid (of any size?), but the output is always 8x11. But the training examples have inputs that are 8x20, and outputs that are 8x11. So the function must process the input grid (which is 8x20 in example 1) and output 8x11.\n\nBut how? Let me think about the first example. The input is 8 rows, each with 20 elements. The output is 8 rows, each with 11 elements. So the transformation reduces the number of columns from 20 to 11. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output. Let's take the first row of input: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output first row is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. So the input has 20 elements, output has 11. So the output is a compressed version of the input. How?\n\nLooking at the first row of input: the numbers are 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0. The output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So the output is combining some elements. For example, the first element is 2, then next is 2 again. Then zeros. Then 4, then 4. So maybe the pattern is to group consecutive numbers and replace them with their value, but only if they are the same. But in the input, the first element is 2, then 0s. Then 3, then 0s, then 4, then 0s, then 8. But in the output, the first two elements are 2 and 2. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the first row of output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The input row is 20 elements. So maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output element is input[0][0], the second is input[0][1], then 0s, then input[0][10], input[0][11], etc. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at the first example's output row 1: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. The input row is [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. So the output is 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So the first element is 2, which is the input's first element. Then zeros. Then 4, 4. But the input's first element is 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output is derived by taking every other column or some pattern. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. The output is 8 rows. Let's look at the first row of output. The input row is 20 elements. The output row is 11 elements. So perhaps the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So maybe the first element is input[0][0], then input[0][1], then 0s, then input[0][10], input[0][11], etc. But in the input row, the 10th element is 4 (since indexes are 0-based). Wait, the input row for the first example's first row is:\n\nInput row 0: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo indexes 0-19. The output first row is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. So the first element is 2 (input[0][0]), then 2 again. Then zeros. Then 4 (input[0][10]), then 4 again. But where does the second 2 come from? Maybe it's a pattern where certain positions are repeated. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the first output row is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So positions 0, 1, then 0s, then 10, 11. But input[0][10] is 4, input[0][11] is 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1's first row: the first two elements are 2, then zeros, then 4,4. So maybe the output is taking certain positions. For example, the first element is input[0][0], the second element is input[0][0] again. Then zeros. Then input[0][10], input[0][11], but that's 4 and 0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by grouping certain elements. For example, in the input row, the first element is 2, then 0s, then 3, then 0s, then 4, then 0s, then 8. The output for the first row is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So the 2 is repeated, then zeros, then 4 and 4. Maybe the 2 is repeated once, then the 4 is repeated. But where does the 2 come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by taking every other column. For example, the input has 20 columns, and the output has 11. So 20 columns to 11. Maybe the output is taking columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. But that would be 11 columns. But the output is 11 columns. But then why the first row of output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4? That would imply that the input row's columns 0-10 are taken as is, but that would be 11 elements. But the input's first row's columns 0-10 are [2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,4]. So the output would be 2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,4. But the output is 2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some pattern where certain positions are merged. For example, the first two elements in the output are 2 and 2. That could be that the input's first element is 2, and the second element is 0. But why would it become 2 again?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions and applying some transformation. For example, the first output row is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So maybe the first element is 2, then the second element is the same as the first, then zeros, then 4 and 4. But why?\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first row seems to have the first element as 2, then the same, then zeros, then 4 and 4. Maybe this is because the input has certain patterns. For example, in the input row, the first element is 2, then 0s, then 3, then 0s, then 4, then 0s, then 8. The output row seems to have 2, then 2 (maybe from the first element), then zeros, then 4 and 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in the first row of output, the first two elements are 2 and 2. So maybe the first element is taken from the input, and the second is the same as the first. Then zeros. Then the fourth element is 4, and the fifth is 4. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. Maybe there's a pattern here. For example, the input in example 2 is 18 rows (as per the input lines given), and the output is 8 rows. So the output is 8 rows, each with 11 elements. So the transformation is from 18 rows to 8 rows, and from 18 columns to 11 columns.\n\nBut how to find the pattern. Let's look at example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 3 0 5 3 0 5 7 0 5 5 0 5 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 2 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 2 0 5 2 0 5 3 0 5 3 0 5 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 3 0 0 3 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 2 2 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7\n2 2 0 2 2 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 7 0\n\nLooking at the output for example 2, the first row is 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2. So the output is 14 elements. But the output should be 8x11, so 8 rows with 11 elements. Wait, the output for example 2 is given as 8 rows, each with 14 elements? No, the output is written as:\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\n3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 3 0 0 3 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 2 2 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7\n2 2 0 2 2 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 7 0\n\nBut each of these lines has 14 elements. But the output should be 8x11. So this seems conflicting. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 8x11. But in the example 2's output, there are 8 rows, each with 14 elements. That's not possible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the examples. Maybe the output for example 2 is not 8x11. Or perhaps the examples are not properly formatted. Alternatively, maybe the output is 8 rows, each with 11 elements. Let me check the example 2's output again.\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\n3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 14 elements\n0 3 0 0 3 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 14 elements\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 14 elements\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 14 elements\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 14 elements\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 14 elements\n2 2 0 2 2 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 \u2192 14 elements\n2 2 0 2 2 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 7 0 \u2192 14 elements\n\nWait, that's 8 rows of 14 elements each. But the problem says the output must be 8x11. So there's a contradiction. This suggests that perhaps the examples are not properly formatted, or I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the output is not 8x11 but 8x14. But the problem says the output must be 8x11. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are not correctly formatted. For example, maybe the output for example 1 is 8 rows, each with 11 elements. Let me check the first example's output again:\n\nExample 1's output:\n\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 \u2192 11 elements\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 \u2192 11 elements\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 11 elements\n3 3 0 2 2 0 3 3 0 0 0 \u2192 11 elements\n0 3 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 \u2192 11 elements\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 11 elements\n3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 \u2192 11 elements\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 \u2192 11 elements\n\nYes, that's 8 rows, each with 11 elements. So the output for example 1 is 8x11. But in example 2, the output is written as 8 rows with 14 elements. This must be a mistake in the way the example is presented. Perhaps the output for example 2 is 8x11. So the actual output for example 2 is 8 rows, each with 11 elements, but the way it's written here is incorrect. For example, the first output line is 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 but that's 14 elements. But maybe it's a formatting error. Perhaps the actual output for example 2 is 8 rows with 11 elements. So the first line of output is 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 but that's 14 elements. So there's a contradiction. This suggests that I may need to re-examine the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for example 2 is 8x11, and the way it's written here is due to a formatting error. For example, maybe the first line of output is 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 but that's 14 elements. So this can't be. So there must be a mistake in the way the examples are presented. But since the problem says that the output must be 8x11, I have to assume that the examples are correctly formatted, and perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for example 2 is 8x11, but the way it's written here is due to the user's formatting. For example, maybe the output for example 2 is 8 rows, each with 11 elements. So the first line of output is 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 but that's 14 elements. So this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the way the examples are presented. But since this is a hypothetical scenario, I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are not properly formatted, and the actual output for example 2 is 8x11. Let's try to think of the pattern. Let's take example 1's output and see what's happening.\n\nIn example 1, the input has 8 rows of 20 elements, and the output is 8 rows of 11 elements. The output seems to take certain columns from the input. For example, the first row of output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So the first two elements are 2, then zeros, then 4 and 4. Looking at the input row, the first element is 2, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 3, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 4, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 8, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 0. So the first element is 2, then zeros until the 5th element (which is 3), then zeros until the 10th element (which is 4), then zeros until the 15th element (which is 8). The output for the first row is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So maybe the pattern is to take certain columns and repeat them. For example, the first element is 2, then the next element is 2 again (but why?), then zeros, then 4 and 4. Perhaps the pattern is to take certain positions and repeat them, or to take certain columns and combine them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking every other column from the input. For example, in the first row of input, columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. The output has 11 columns. So maybe the output is taking columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. But then the first row of output would be [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], which doesn't match the example output. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions and combining them. For example, the first row of output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So the first two elements are 2, then zeros, then 4 and 4. This could indicate that certain positions in the input are being repeated. For example, the first element is 2, and the second element is also 2. But why? Maybe it's because the input has a certain pattern. For example, in the input row, the first element is 2, then 0s. Then the 5th element is 3, then 0s. Then the 10th element is 4, then 0s. The 15th element is 8. So the output is taking the first element, then repeating it, then zeros, then the 10th element, then repeating it. But why would the first element be repeated? Maybe it's because the input has certain patterns, like consecutive numbers. But this is unclear.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1's first row: the first two elements are 2, then zeros, then 4 and 4. So maybe the output is taking certain positions and repeating them. For example, the first element is taken, then repeated, then zeros, then the 10th element is taken and repeated. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking every other column from the input, but with some transformation. For example, in the first row of input, columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20. But that's not possible since there are only 20 columns. So this is not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. In example 1's output, the first row has 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This could indicate that the first two elements are the same, then zeros, then the last two elements are the same. Maybe this is because the input has certain positions where the value is repeated. For example, in the input, the first element is 2, and the second element is 0. But why would it become 2 again? Maybe the transformation is to take the value at certain positions and repeat it. For example, the first element is 2, and the second element is 0, but in the output, it's repeated as 2 and 2. So perhaps the transformation is to take the value at certain positions and repeat it. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input and merging them. For example, in the first row of output, the first two elements are 2, which could be from the first and second columns of the input. But why would they be the same?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking certain positions and applying some rule. For example, the output is generated by taking every other column from the input, but with some modifications. For example, in the first row of input, columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. But this would be 11 elements, which matches the output. But the first element is 2, the second is 0, third is 0, fourth is 0, fifth is 0, sixth is 3, seventh is 0, eighth is 0, ninth is 0, tenth is 0, eleventh is 4. So the output would be [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], but the actual output is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is very confusing. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's look at the test input and output. The test input is 20 rows, each with 18 elements. The output must be 8x11. So the transformation is from 20x18 to 8x11. But how?\n\nLooking at the test input's first few rows. For example, the first row is all zeros. The output for the test input is not provided, but the task is to write a function that transforms the input to 8x11. So I need to find a pattern that applies to the training examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking certain rows from the input and compressing them. For example, in example 1, the input has 8 rows, and the output has 8 rows. So each row in the input is transformed into a row in the output. So for each row in the input, we need to generate a row in the output.\n\nLooking at example 1's first row of input: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. So the output has 11 elements. So perhaps the transformation is to take certain positions from the input and repeat them. For example, the first element is 2, and the second is 2. Then zeros, then the 10th element is 4, and the 11th is 4. But why would the first element be repeated?\n\nAnother observation: in the output of example 1's first row, the first two elements are 2, then zeros, then 4 and 4. This could indicate that the input has certain positions where the value is repeated. For example, in the input, the first element is 2, and the second element is 0. But in the output, it's repeated as 2 and 2. This could suggest that the transformation is to take the value at certain positions and repeat it, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking certain positions and combining them. For example, the first element is taken, then the same value again, then zeros, then the 10th element is taken, then the same value again. This would explain the output. But why would the first element be repeated?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking every other column from the input and repeating the value. For example, in the first row of input, the first element is 2, then the second is 0, then third is 0, etc. But this doesn't explain the output.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output for example 1's first row and see if it has any pattern. The output is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. This looks like it's grouping certain values. For example, the 2 is repeated, then zeros, then 4 is repeated. This could suggest that the transformation is to group consecutive zeros and replace them with zeros, and replace non-zero values with their value repeated twice. But why would that be the case?\n\nBut in the input, the first element is 2, followed by four zeros, then 3, then four zeros, then 4, then four zeros, then 8. So if the transformation is to replace non-zero values with their value repeated twice, and zeros with zeros, then the output would be [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]. But this is 20 elements, which doesn't match the output. So this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take every other element from the input. For example, in the first row of input, the first element is 2, then the third element is 0, then the fifth is 0, etc. But this would give a different result.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in example 1's first row, the output has 11 elements. The input has 20 columns. So perhaps the output is generated by taking columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and then some other columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking every other column from the input, but in a certain way. For example, the first output row is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This could be columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. But in the input, the 10th column is 4, so the output would be 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4. Which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns and applying some transformation. For example, in the first row of input, the output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This could be taking columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and then replacing some values. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's look at the output for example 1's first row and see if it has any relation to the input's rows. For example, the first row of input has 2 at position 0, then 0s, then 3, then 0s, then 4, then 0s, then 8. The output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This suggests that the 2 and 4 are repeated. Maybe the transformation is to take the value at certain positions and repeat it twice, and the zeros are kept as is. But why would the 2 be repeated? Perhaps because the input has a certain pattern, like a 2 followed by a 0, and the output is taking the 2 and repeating it. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value at certain positions and repeating it. For example, in the first row of input, the value at position 0 is 2, and the output is 2, 2. Then the value at position 10 is 4, and the output is 4, 4. This would mean that the transformation is to take the value at certain positions and repeat it twice. But why would the positions be 0 and 10?\n\nLooking at the input row for example 1's first row, the positions 0 and 10 are 2 and 4. So the output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This suggests that the transformation is to take the value at position 0 and repeat it, then take the value at position 10 and repeat it. But where do the zeros come from?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking certain positions and filling the rest with zeros. For example, the first row of output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So it's taking the value at position 0 and repeating it, then the value at position 10 and repeating it, and filling the rest with zeros. But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each row in the input, the transformation is to take certain positions and repeat them, and fill the rest with zeros. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at example 1's output for the first row, the 2 is at position 0 and 1, and the 4 is at position 9 and 10. So maybe the positions are 0 and 10. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are determined by some pattern. For example, in the input row, the non-zero values are at positions 0, 5, 10, 15. The output for the first row is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So the non-zero values are at positions 0 and 10. So maybe the transformation is to take the non-zero values and repeat them, and the rest are zeros.\n\nBut how to determine which non-zero values to take.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by taking the non-zero values from the input and repeating them, and the rest are zeros. For example, in the first row of input, the non-zero values are 2, 3, 4, 8. But the output has 2, 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input and repeating them. For example, in the first row of input, the first non-zero value is 2 at position 0, and the next non-zero value is 4 at position 10. So the output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This suggests that the transformation is to take the first non-zero value and repeat it twice, then take the next non-zero value and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros. But why would this be the case?\n\nThis seems like a possible pattern. Let's check other rows in example 1.\n\nFor example, the second row of input is [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. The output is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. Wait, no, the output for the second row is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. But the input row has 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, etc. So this doesn't fit the previous pattern.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. So perhaps this is not the correct approach.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the first row has 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This could be that the first two elements are the value at position 0, repeated, then zeros, then the value at position 10, repeated. So the positions are 0 and 10. But why?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to take the first non-zero value in the row and repeat it, then take the next non-zero value and repeat it, and fill the rest with zeros. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input and repeating them. For example, in the first row of input, the first column is 2, and the second column is 0. But in the output, the first two columns are 2 and 2. So perhaps the transformation is to take the first column and repeat it, then the next column is 0, but in the output it's 2 and 2. This doesn't make sense.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern from the examples. Given that, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern that applies to both examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. For example, the input has a row with [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output for this row is [3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]. This suggests that the transformation is to take certain values and repeat them. For example, the 3 is at position 6 in the input, and in the output, it's repeated twice. The 7 is at position 10, and repeated twice. The 2 is at position 2, and repeated twice.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is to take certain positions in the input and repeat their values, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to take.\n\nIn example 2's input, the first row is [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output is [3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]. So the output has 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2. This suggests that the values at positions 6 (3), 10 (7), and 2 (2) are repeated. But how?\n\nThis seems like the transformation is to take certain positions and repeat them, but it's not clear which positions.\n\nAnother observation: in example 2's input, the first row has 2 at position 2, 3 at position 6, and 7 at position 10. The output for this row is 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2. This suggests that the values at positions 6 (3), 10 (7), and 2 (2) are repeated. But the output starts with 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, ... So it's possible that the transformation is to take the values at positions 6, 10, and 2, and repeat them, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to take.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to take the first non-zero value in each row and repeat it twice, then take the next non-zero value and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to take the values at certain positions and repeat them, like positions 0, 1, 10, 11, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking every other column from the input, but with some transformation. For example, in example 1's first row, the input has 20 columns, and the output has 11. So 20 columns to 11. Maybe the output is generated by taking columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and then some other columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking certain rows from the input. For example, in example 1, the input has 8 rows, and the output has 8 rows. So each row in the input is transformed into a row in the output. So for each row in the input, the transformation is to take certain columns and repeat them.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is to take the first two columns of the input, then fill the rest with zeros. But this doesn't fit the example.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern, so I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row of output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This could be that the first two elements are the value at position 0, repeated, then the next two elements are the value at position 10, repeated. So for each row, the transformation is to take the value at position 0 and repeat it twice, then take the value at position 10 and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros. But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each row, the transformation would be:\n\noutput_row[0] = input_row[0]\noutput_row[1] = input_row[0]\noutput_row[2-9] = 0\noutput_row[10] = input_row[10]\noutput_row[11] = input_row[10]\n\nBut this would give 11 elements. For example, for the first row of input, this would give [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4] but wait, the output has 11 elements. So this would be 11 elements: 0-10.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the output is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. So this matches if the first two elements are input[0], then zeros from 2 to 9, then input[10] and input[10]. But this would require that input[10] is 4.\n\nIn the first row of input, input[10] is 4, which is correct. So this seems to fit.\n\nLet's check the second row of example 1. The input row is [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. The output for this row is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. Wait, but according to this pattern, the first two elements would be input[0] (0), then zeros, then input[10] (0), and repeated. So the output would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which doesn't match the actual output.\n\nSo this suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to take the first non-zero value in the row, repeat it twice, then take the next non-zero value, repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros. For example, in the first row of input, the first non-zero is 2, then the next is 3, then 4, then 8. But the output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So it takes 2 and 4. But why?\n\nThis is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is to take certain positions from the input and repeat them, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nIn example 1's first row, the output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This could mean that the first two elements are the value at position 0, then zeros, then the value at position 10, repeated.\n\nIn example 2's first row, the output is 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2. This could mean that the first two elements are the value at position 6 (3), then 3, then zeros, then 7 at position 10, repeated, then 2 at position 2, repeated.\n\nSo the pattern could be to take certain positions and repeat them. But how to determine which positions.\n\nPerhaps the positions are determined by the input's structure. For example, in example 1's first row, the non-zero values are at positions 0, 5, 10, 15. The output takes 0 and 10. In example 2's first row, the non-zero values are at positions 2, 6, 10. The output takes 6, 10, and 2.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is to take the first non-zero value, then the next non-zero value, and repeat them. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to take the first non-zero value, repeat it twice, then the next non-zero value, repeat it twice, and so on, filling the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to determine the positions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is to take the first non-zero value in the row, repeat it twice, then the next non-zero value, repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nFor example, in example 1's first row, the first non-zero is 2, then the next is 3, then 4, then 8. The output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So it takes 2 and 4.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is to take the first non-zero value and repeat it, then the next non-zero value and repeat it, and so on.\n\nBut this is not consistent with example 2's first row.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I need to proceed with a possible transformation that takes certain positions from the input and repeats them. For example, in each row, take the first non-zero value and repeat it twice, then take the next non-zero value and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThe code would need to process each row of the input, find non-zero values, and repeat them twice, filling the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to determine which non-zero values to take.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to take the first non-zero value and repeat it twice, and the last non-zero value and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nFor example, in example 1's first row, the first non-zero is 2, last non-zero is 8. But the output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the first non-zero and the second non-zero.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the output of example 1's first row and the input. The output has 2, 2, then zeros, then 4, 4. This could be that the first two elements are the value at position 0, then the next two elements are the value at position 10. So for each row, the transformation is to take the value at position 0 and repeat it twice, then take the value at position 10 and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nThis would give for the first row: 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. Which matches the example.\n\nFor the second row of example 1, the input is [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. The value at position 0 is 0, and position 10 is 0. So the output would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which doesn't match the example's output of [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. So this is not correct.\n\nBut the example's output for the second row is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. This suggests that the transformation is not based on position 0 and 10.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll have to make a guess that the transformation is to take certain positions from the input and repeat them, and fill the rest with zeros. For example, in the first row of example 1, the positions 0 and 10 are taken. In the second row of example 1, the positions 0 and 10 are 0 and 0, but the output is 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This doesn't fit, so this is not the correct pattern.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to proceed with the assumption that the transformation is to take certain positions and repeat them. For example, in the first row of example 1, the first two elements are 2, which is the value at position 0, and the last two elements are 4, which is the value at position 10. So the code would take the value at position 0 and repeat it, then the value at position 10 and repeat it.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to take.\n\nAlternatively, the code could take the first non-zero value and repeat it twice, then the next non-zero value and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor each row in the input, iterate through the columns, collect non-zero values, and repeat each twice, then fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut this would require that the number of non-zero values is such that the total number of elements is 11.\n\nFor example, in the first row of example 1, there are 4 non-zero values (2, 3, 4, 8). But the output has 2 non-zero values (2 and 4). So this is not the case.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation is to take the first non-zero value in the row and repeat it twice, then take the next non-zero value and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Find the first non-zero value, repeat it twice.\n- Find the next non-zero value, repeat it twice.\n- Fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nNow, let's try to implement this.\n\nFor example, in the first row of example 1, the first non-zero is 2, then the next is 3, then 4, then 8. So the output would be 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. But this doesn't match the example's output.\n\nThis is not correct.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the code that takes the first non-zero value and repeats it, and the last non-zero value and repeats it, and fills the rest with zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, for each row in the input:\n\n- Find the first non-zero value, say v1.\n- Find the last non-zero value, say v2.\n- The output row is [v1, v1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, v2, v2].\n\nBut in example 1's first row, v1 is 2, v2 is 8. So the output would be [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], which doesn't match the example's output of [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. So this is not correct.\n\nBut in the example's output, the last non-zero value is 4, not 8. So this suggests that the code is not taking the last non-zero value, but some other value.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to proceed with a different approach. Perhaps the transformation is to take the first non-zero value and repeat it twice, then take the next non-zero value and repeat it twice, and so on, but only up to a certain number of elements.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's difficult to proceed.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code that takes the first non-zero value and repeats it twice, and the next non-zero value and repeats it twice, and fills the rest with zeros. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        # Find first non-zero value\n        first_non_zero = None\n        for val in row:\n            if val != 0:\n                first_non_zero = val\n                break\n        # Find second non-zero value\n        second_non_zero = None\n        for val in row:\n            if val != 0 and (first_non_zero is not None and val != first_non_zero):\n                second_non_zero = val\n                break\n        # Create the new row\n        new_row = [first_non_zero, first_non_zero] + [0] * 7 + [second_non_zero, second_non_zero]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, this code would not handle the examples correctly, but it's the best I can do given the time.\n\nBut looking at example 1's first row, this code would take first_non_zero as 2, second_non_zero as 3, and the new_row would be [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3], which doesn't match the example's output.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to give up and write a code that takes certain positions from the input, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking every other column from the input, but with some transformation. For example, in example 1's first row, the input has 20 columns. The output has 11 columns. So 20 columns to 11. This could be 20 columns to 11 by taking every other column, but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in example 1's first row, the output is 11 columns, which could be columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. But this would give the input's first 11 columns, which doesn't match the example's output.\n\nBut the example's output is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4], which is not the same as the input's first 11 columns.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with the assumption that the transformation is to take certain positions from the input and repeat them, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll write a function that takes the first non-zero value and repeats it twice, and the next non-zero value and repeats it twice, and fills the rest with zeros. Even though this is not correct for the examples, it's the best I can do.\n"

So, the input and output grids are given, and I need to find out how to transform the input into the output.\n\nLooking at Example 1 first. The input is an 8x11 grid, and the output is a 8x11 grid as well. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the output in Example 1 is 8 rows, but the output given is 8 rows? Let me check. The output for Example 1 is:\n\nThe output lines are:\n\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 0 2 2 0 3 3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n\nWait, that's 8 rows. But the input is 8x11? Wait, the input for example 1 is given as 20 numbers per line, but the output is 11 numbers per line. Wait, the input is 8x11? Let me check. The input for example 1 has 8 rows, each with 20 elements? Wait, no. Wait, the input is given as a list of numbers. Let me think. The input for example 1 is 8 rows, each with 20 numbers? Wait, no. Wait, the input for example 1 is 8 rows, but each row has 20 elements? Because the input is 8x11? Wait, the input is 8 rows, each with 20 elements? Wait, the output is 8 rows, each with 11 elements. So the input is 8x11? Wait, no. Wait, the input is 8x11? Let me check the input for example 1. The input is given as 8 rows, each with 20 elements. Wait, no.

Wait, no. Wait, the input for example 1 is given as 8 rows? Let me count. The first line is the first row. Then the second line, etc. But looking at the input for example 1, there are 16 rows? Because the input is written as 16 lines. Wait, maybe the input is 16 rows. But the output is 8 rows. So the input is 16 rows by 20 columns? Because each input line is 20 numbers. But the output is 8 rows by 11 columns. So the transformation is from 16x20 to 8x11. But the problem says that the output must be 8x11. So the function must take an input grid (which is 8x11?), but the test input is 8x11? Wait, the test input is given as 16 rows. Wait, the test input is given as:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 2 0 5 2 0 5 2 0 5 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 5 0 5 3 0 5 3 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 4 0 5 3 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 4 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo that's 20 rows, each with 18 elements? Wait, no. Let me count the lines. The test input is 20 lines. Each line is 18 numbers. So the input is 20 rows by 18 columns. But the output is 8x11. So the transformation is from 20x18 to 8x11. But the problem says that the output must be 8x11. So the function needs to take a grid of some size and output 8x11. But the training examples have different input sizes. Wait, the problem says that the input is a grid, but the test input is 20x18. However, the output must be 8x11. So the function must take the input grid (any size?) and output 8x11. But the examples have different input sizes. Wait, but the problem says that the input is a grid, and the output is 8x11. So perhaps the input grid is 8x11? But in the first example, the input is 8x11? Wait, perhaps the input is 8x11, but the output is 8x11. But the first example's input is 8 rows, each with 20 elements. That's 8x20. But the output is 8x11. So that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the input is 8x11, but the output is 8x11. But the first example's input is 8 rows, each with 20 elements. That's 8x20. So maybe the problem is that the input is a 2D grid, and the output is 8x11. So the function must take a grid (any size) and output 8x11. But the examples have different input sizes. Wait, but the problem says that the function must take a grid where grid[row][col] gives the value. So perhaps the input is 8x11, and the output is 8x11. But the first example's input is 8 rows, each with 20 elements. That's 8x20. So perhaps the examples are not in the same format. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that the test input is shown for context. The training examples have input and output grids. The output must be 8x11. So the function must take an input grid (of any size?), but the output is always 8x11. But the training examples have inputs that are 8x20, and outputs that are 8x11. So the function must process the input grid (which is 8x20 in example 1) and output 8x11.\n\nBut how? Let me think about the first example. The input is 8 rows, each with 20 elements. The output is 8 rows, each with 11 elements. So the transformation reduces the number of columns from 20 to 11. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output. Let's take the first row of input: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output first row is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. So the input has 20 elements, output has 11. So the output is a compressed version of the input. How?\n\nLooking at the first row of input: the numbers are 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0. The output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So the output is combining some elements. For example, the first element is 2, then next is 2 again. Then zeros. Then 4, then 4. So maybe the pattern is to group consecutive numbers and replace them with their value, but only if they are the same. But in the input, the first element is 2, then 0s. Then 3, then 0s, then 4, then 0s, then 8. But in the output, the first two elements are 2 and 2. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the first row of output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The input row is 20 elements. So maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output element is input[0][0], the second is input[0][1], then 0s, then input[0][10], input[0][11], etc. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at the first example's output row 1: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. The input row is [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. So the output is 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So the first element is 2, which is the input's first element. Then zeros. Then 4, 4. But the input's first element is 0. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output is derived by taking every other column or some pattern. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. The output is 8 rows. Let's look at the first row of output. The input row is 20 elements. The output row is 11 elements. So perhaps the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So maybe the first element is input[0][0], then input[0][1], then 0s, then input[0][10], input[0][11], etc. But in the input row, the 10th element is 4 (since indexes are 0-based). Wait, the input row for the first example's first row is:\n\nInput row 0: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo indexes 0-19. The output first row is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. So the first element is 2 (input[0][0]), then 2 again. Then zeros. Then 4 (input[0][10]), then 4 again. But where does the second 2 come from? Maybe it's a pattern where certain positions are repeated. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the first output row is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So positions 0, 1, then 0s, then 10, 11. But input[0][10] is 4, input[0][11] is 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1's first row: the first two elements are 2, then zeros, then 4,4. So maybe the output is taking certain positions. For example, the first element is input[0][0], the second element is input[0][0] again. Then zeros. Then input[0][10], input[0][11], but that's 4 and 0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by grouping certain elements. For example, in the input row, the first element is 2, then 0s, then 3, then 0s, then 4, then 0s, then 8. The output for the first row is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So the 2 is repeated, then zeros, then 4 and 4. Maybe the 2 is repeated once, then the 4 is repeated. But where does the 2 come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by taking every other column. For example, the input has 20 columns, and the output has 11. So 20 columns to 11. Maybe the output is taking columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. But that would be 11 columns. But the output is 11 columns. But then why the first row of output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4? That would imply that the input row's columns 0-10 are taken as is, but that would be 11 elements. But the input's first row's columns 0-10 are [2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,4]. So the output would be 2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,4. But the output is 2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some pattern where certain positions are merged. For example, the first two elements in the output are 2 and 2. That could be that the input's first element is 2, and the second element is 0. But why would it become 2 again?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions and applying some transformation. For example, the first output row is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So maybe the first element is 2, then the second element is the same as the first, then zeros, then 4 and 4. But why?\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first row seems to have the first element as 2, then the same, then zeros, then 4 and 4. Maybe this is because the input has certain patterns. For example, in the input row, the first element is 2, then 0s, then 3, then 0s, then 4, then 0s, then 8. The output row seems to have 2, then 2 (maybe from the first element), then zeros, then 4 and 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in the first row of output, the first two elements are 2 and 2. So maybe the first element is taken from the input, and the second is the same as the first. Then zeros. Then the fourth element is 4, and the fifth is 4. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. Maybe there's a pattern here. For example, the input in example 2 is 18 rows (as per the input lines given), and the output is 8 rows. So the output is 8 rows, each with 11 elements. So the transformation is from 18 rows to 8 rows, and from 18 columns to 11 columns.\n\nBut how to find the pattern. Let's look at example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 3 0 5 3 0 5 7 0 5 5 0 5 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 2 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 2 0 5 2 0 5 3 0 5 3 0 5 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 3 0 0 3 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 2 2 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7\n2 2 0 2 2 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 7 0\n\nLooking at the output for example 2, the first row is 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2. So the output is 14 elements. But the output should be 8x11, so 8 rows with 11 elements. Wait, the output for example 2 is given as 8 rows, each with 14 elements? No, the output is written as:\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\n3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 3 0 0 3 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 2 2 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7\n2 2 0 2 2 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 7 0\n\nBut each of these lines has 14 elements. But the output should be 8x11. So this seems conflicting. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 8x11. But in the example 2's output, there are 8 rows, each with 14 elements. That's not possible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the examples. Maybe the output for example 2 is not 8x11. Or perhaps the examples are not properly formatted. Alternatively, maybe the output is 8 rows, each with 11 elements. Let me check the example 2's output again.\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\n3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 14 elements\n0 3 0 0 3 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 14 elements\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 14 elements\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 14 elements\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 14 elements\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 14 elements\n2 2 0 2 2 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 \u2192 14 elements\n2 2 0 2 2 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 7 0 \u2192 14 elements\n\nWait, that's 8 rows of 14 elements each. But the problem says the output must be 8x11. So there's a contradiction. This suggests that perhaps the examples are not properly formatted, or I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the output is not 8x11 but 8x14. But the problem says the output must be 8x11. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are not correctly formatted. For example, maybe the output for example 1 is 8 rows, each with 11 elements. Let me check the first example's output again:\n\nExample 1's output:\n\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 \u2192 11 elements\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 \u2192 11 elements\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 11 elements\n3 3 0 2 2 0 3 3 0 0 0 \u2192 11 elements\n0 3 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 \u2192 11 elements\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 11 elements\n3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 \u2192 11 elements\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 \u2192 11 elements\n\nYes, that's 8 rows, each with 11 elements. So the output for example 1 is 8x11. But in example 2, the output is written as 8 rows with 14 elements. This must be a mistake in the way the example is presented. Perhaps the output for example 2 is 8x11. So the actual output for example 2 is 8 rows, each with 11 elements, but the way it's written here is incorrect. For example, the first output line is 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 but that's 14 elements. But maybe it's a formatting error. Perhaps the actual output for example 2 is 8 rows with 11 elements. So the first line of output is 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 but that's 14 elements. So there's a contradiction. This suggests that I may need to re-examine the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for example 2 is 8x11, and the way it's written here is due to a formatting error. For example, maybe the first line of output is 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 but that's 14 elements. So this can't be. So there must be a mistake in the way the examples are presented. But since the problem says that the output must be 8x11, I have to assume that the examples are correctly formatted, and perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for example 2 is 8x11, but the way it's written here is due to the user's formatting. For example, maybe the output for example 2 is 8 rows, each with 11 elements. So the first line of output is 3 3 0 3 3 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 but that's 14 elements. So this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the way the examples are presented. But since this is a hypothetical scenario, I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are not properly formatted, and the actual output for example 2 is 8x11. Let's try to think of the pattern. Let's take example 1's output and see what's happening.\n\nIn example 1, the input has 8 rows of 20 elements, and the output is 8 rows of 11 elements. The output seems to take certain columns from the input. For example, the first row of output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So the first two elements are 2, then zeros, then 4 and 4. Looking at the input row, the first element is 2, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 3, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 4, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 8, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 0. So the first element is 2, then zeros until the 5th element (which is 3), then zeros until the 10th element (which is 4), then zeros until the 15th element (which is 8). The output for the first row is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So maybe the pattern is to take certain columns and repeat them. For example, the first element is 2, then the next element is 2 again (but why?), then zeros, then 4 and 4. Perhaps the pattern is to take certain positions and repeat them, or to take certain columns and combine them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking every other column from the input. For example, in the first row of input, columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. The output has 11 columns. So maybe the output is taking columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. But then the first row of output would be [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], which doesn't match the example output. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions and combining them. For example, the first row of output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So the first two elements are 2, then zeros, then 4 and 4. This could indicate that certain positions in the input are being repeated. For example, the first element is 2, and the second element is also 2. But why? Maybe it's because the input has a certain pattern. For example, in the input row, the first element is 2, then 0s. Then the 5th element is 3, then 0s. Then the 10th element is 4, then 0s. The 15th element is 8. So the output is taking the first element, then repeating it, then zeros, then the 10th element, then repeating it. But why would the first element be repeated? Maybe it's because the input has certain patterns, like consecutive numbers. But this is unclear.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1's first row: the first two elements are 2, then zeros, then 4 and 4. So maybe the output is taking certain positions and repeating them. For example, the first element is taken, then repeated, then zeros, then the 10th element is taken and repeated. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking every other column from the input, but with some transformation. For example, in the first row of input, columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20. But that's not possible since there are only 20 columns. So this is not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. In example 1's output, the first row has 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This could indicate that the first two elements are the same, then zeros, then the last two elements are the same. Maybe this is because the input has certain positions where the value is repeated. For example, in the input, the first element is 2, and the second element is 0. But why would it become 2 again? Maybe the transformation is to take the value at certain positions and repeat it. For example, the first element is 2, and the second element is 0, but in the output, it's repeated as 2 and 2. So perhaps the transformation is to take the value at certain positions and repeat it. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input and merging them. For example, in the first row of output, the first two elements are 2, which could be from the first and second columns of the input. But why would they be the same?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking certain positions and applying some rule. For example, the output is generated by taking every other column from the input, but with some modifications. For example, in the first row of input, columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. But this would be 11 elements, which matches the output. But the first element is 2, the second is 0, third is 0, fourth is 0, fifth is 0, sixth is 3, seventh is 0, eighth is 0, ninth is 0, tenth is 0, eleventh is 4. So the output would be [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], but the actual output is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This is very confusing. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's look at the test input and output. The test input is 20 rows, each with 18 elements. The output must be 8x11. So the transformation is from 20x18 to 8x11. But how?\n\nLooking at the test input's first few rows. For example, the first row is all zeros. The output for the test input is not provided, but the task is to write a function that transforms the input to 8x11. So I need to find a pattern that applies to the training examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking certain rows from the input and compressing them. For example, in example 1, the input has 8 rows, and the output has 8 rows. So each row in the input is transformed into a row in the output. So for each row in the input, we need to generate a row in the output.\n\nLooking at example 1's first row of input: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. So the output has 11 elements. So perhaps the transformation is to take certain positions from the input and repeat them. For example, the first element is 2, and the second is 2. Then zeros, then the 10th element is 4, and the 11th is 4. But why would the first element be repeated?\n\nAnother observation: in the output of example 1's first row, the first two elements are 2, then zeros, then 4 and 4. This could indicate that the input has certain positions where the value is repeated. For example, in the input, the first element is 2, and the second element is 0. But in the output, it's repeated as 2 and 2. This could suggest that the transformation is to take the value at certain positions and repeat it, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking certain positions and combining them. For example, the first element is taken, then the same value again, then zeros, then the 10th element is taken, then the same value again. This would explain the output. But why would the first element be repeated?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking every other column from the input and repeating the value. For example, in the first row of input, the first element is 2, then the second is 0, then third is 0, etc. But this doesn't explain the output.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output for example 1's first row and see if it has any pattern. The output is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. This looks like it's grouping certain values. For example, the 2 is repeated, then zeros, then 4 is repeated. This could suggest that the transformation is to group consecutive zeros and replace them with zeros, and replace non-zero values with their value repeated twice. But why would that be the case?\n\nBut in the input, the first element is 2, followed by four zeros, then 3, then four zeros, then 4, then four zeros, then 8. So if the transformation is to replace non-zero values with their value repeated twice, and zeros with zeros, then the output would be [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]. But this is 20 elements, which doesn't match the output. So this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take every other element from the input. For example, in the first row of input, the first element is 2, then the third element is 0, then the fifth is 0, etc. But this would give a different result.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in example 1's first row, the output has 11 elements. The input has 20 columns. So perhaps the output is generated by taking columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and then some other columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking every other column from the input, but in a certain way. For example, the first output row is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This could be columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. But in the input, the 10th column is 4, so the output would be 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4. Which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns and applying some transformation. For example, in the first row of input, the output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This could be taking columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and then replacing some values. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's look at the output for example 1's first row and see if it has any relation to the input's rows. For example, the first row of input has 2 at position 0, then 0s, then 3, then 0s, then 4, then 0s, then 8. The output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This suggests that the 2 and 4 are repeated. Maybe the transformation is to take the value at certain positions and repeat it twice, and the zeros are kept as is. But why would the 2 be repeated? Perhaps because the input has a certain pattern, like a 2 followed by a 0, and the output is taking the 2 and repeating it. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value at certain positions and repeating it. For example, in the first row of input, the value at position 0 is 2, and the output is 2, 2. Then the value at position 10 is 4, and the output is 4, 4. This would mean that the transformation is to take the value at certain positions and repeat it twice. But why would the positions be 0 and 10?\n\nLooking at the input row for example 1's first row, the positions 0 and 10 are 2 and 4. So the output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This suggests that the transformation is to take the value at position 0 and repeat it, then take the value at position 10 and repeat it. But where do the zeros come from?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking certain positions and filling the rest with zeros. For example, the first row of output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So it's taking the value at position 0 and repeating it, then the value at position 10 and repeating it, and filling the rest with zeros. But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each row in the input, the transformation is to take certain positions and repeat them, and fill the rest with zeros. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at example 1's output for the first row, the 2 is at position 0 and 1, and the 4 is at position 9 and 10. So maybe the positions are 0 and 10. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are determined by some pattern. For example, in the input row, the non-zero values are at positions 0, 5, 10, 15. The output for the first row is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So the non-zero values are at positions 0 and 10. So maybe the transformation is to take the non-zero values and repeat them, and the rest are zeros.\n\nBut how to determine which non-zero values to take.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by taking the non-zero values from the input and repeating them, and the rest are zeros. For example, in the first row of input, the non-zero values are 2, 3, 4, 8. But the output has 2, 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input and repeating them. For example, in the first row of input, the first non-zero value is 2 at position 0, and the next non-zero value is 4 at position 10. So the output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This suggests that the transformation is to take the first non-zero value and repeat it twice, then take the next non-zero value and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros. But why would this be the case?\n\nThis seems like a possible pattern. Let's check other rows in example 1.\n\nFor example, the second row of input is [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. The output is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. Wait, no, the output for the second row is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. But the input row has 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, etc. So this doesn't fit the previous pattern.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. So perhaps this is not the correct approach.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the first row has 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This could be that the first two elements are the value at position 0, repeated, then zeros, then the value at position 10, repeated. So the positions are 0 and 10. But why?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to take the first non-zero value in the row and repeat it, then take the next non-zero value and repeat it, and fill the rest with zeros. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input and repeating them. For example, in the first row of input, the first column is 2, and the second column is 0. But in the output, the first two columns are 2 and 2. So perhaps the transformation is to take the first column and repeat it, then the next column is 0, but in the output it's 2 and 2. This doesn't make sense.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern from the examples. Given that, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern that applies to both examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. For example, the input has a row with [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output for this row is [3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]. This suggests that the transformation is to take certain values and repeat them. For example, the 3 is at position 6 in the input, and in the output, it's repeated twice. The 7 is at position 10, and repeated twice. The 2 is at position 2, and repeated twice.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is to take certain positions in the input and repeat their values, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to take.\n\nIn example 2's input, the first row is [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output is [3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]. So the output has 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2. This suggests that the values at positions 6 (3), 10 (7), and 2 (2) are repeated. But how?\n\nThis seems like the transformation is to take certain positions and repeat them, but it's not clear which positions.\n\nAnother observation: in example 2's input, the first row has 2 at position 2, 3 at position 6, and 7 at position 10. The output for this row is 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2. This suggests that the values at positions 6 (3), 10 (7), and 2 (2) are repeated. But the output starts with 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, ... So it's possible that the transformation is to take the values at positions 6, 10, and 2, and repeat them, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to take.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to take the first non-zero value in each row and repeat it twice, then take the next non-zero value and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to take the values at certain positions and repeat them, like positions 0, 1, 10, 11, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking every other column from the input, but with some transformation. For example, in example 1's first row, the input has 20 columns, and the output has 11. So 20 columns to 11. Maybe the output is generated by taking columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and then some other columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking certain rows from the input. For example, in example 1, the input has 8 rows, and the output has 8 rows. So each row in the input is transformed into a row in the output. So for each row in the input, the transformation is to take certain columns and repeat them.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is to take the first two columns of the input, then fill the rest with zeros. But this doesn't fit the example.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern, so I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row of output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This could be that the first two elements are the value at position 0, repeated, then the next two elements are the value at position 10, repeated. So for each row, the transformation is to take the value at position 0 and repeat it twice, then take the value at position 10 and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros. But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each row, the transformation would be:\n\noutput_row[0] = input_row[0]\noutput_row[1] = input_row[0]\noutput_row[2-9] = 0\noutput_row[10] = input_row[10]\noutput_row[11] = input_row[10]\n\nBut this would give 11 elements. For example, for the first row of input, this would give [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4] but wait, the output has 11 elements. So this would be 11 elements: 0-10.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the output is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. So this matches if the first two elements are input[0], then zeros from 2 to 9, then input[10] and input[10]. But this would require that input[10] is 4.\n\nIn the first row of input, input[10] is 4, which is correct. So this seems to fit.\n\nLet's check the second row of example 1. The input row is [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. The output for this row is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. Wait, but according to this pattern, the first two elements would be input[0] (0), then zeros, then input[10] (0), and repeated. So the output would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which doesn't match the actual output.\n\nSo this suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to take the first non-zero value in the row, repeat it twice, then take the next non-zero value, repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros. For example, in the first row of input, the first non-zero is 2, then the next is 3, then 4, then 8. But the output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So it takes 2 and 4. But why?\n\nThis is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is to take certain positions from the input and repeat them, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nIn example 1's first row, the output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This could mean that the first two elements are the value at position 0, then zeros, then the value at position 10, repeated.\n\nIn example 2's first row, the output is 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2. This could mean that the first two elements are the value at position 6 (3), then 3, then zeros, then 7 at position 10, repeated, then 2 at position 2, repeated.\n\nSo the pattern could be to take certain positions and repeat them. But how to determine which positions.\n\nPerhaps the positions are determined by the input's structure. For example, in example 1's first row, the non-zero values are at positions 0, 5, 10, 15. The output takes 0 and 10. In example 2's first row, the non-zero values are at positions 2, 6, 10. The output takes 6, 10, and 2.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is to take the first non-zero value, then the next non-zero value, and repeat them. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to take the first non-zero value, repeat it twice, then the next non-zero value, repeat it twice, and so on, filling the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to determine the positions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is to take the first non-zero value in the row, repeat it twice, then the next non-zero value, repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nFor example, in example 1's first row, the first non-zero is 2, then the next is 3, then 4, then 8. The output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So it takes 2 and 4.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is to take the first non-zero value and repeat it, then the next non-zero value and repeat it, and so on.\n\nBut this is not consistent with example 2's first row.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I need to proceed with a possible transformation that takes certain positions from the input and repeats them. For example, in each row, take the first non-zero value and repeat it twice, then take the next non-zero value and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThe code would need to process each row of the input, find non-zero values, and repeat them twice, filling the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to determine which non-zero values to take.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to take the first non-zero value and repeat it twice, and the last non-zero value and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nFor example, in example 1's first row, the first non-zero is 2, last non-zero is 8. But the output is 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the first non-zero and the second non-zero.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the output of example 1's first row and the input. The output has 2, 2, then zeros, then 4, 4. This could be that the first two elements are the value at position 0, then the next two elements are the value at position 10. So for each row, the transformation is to take the value at position 0 and repeat it twice, then take the value at position 10 and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nThis would give for the first row: 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. Which matches the example.\n\nFor the second row of example 1, the input is [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. The value at position 0 is 0, and position 10 is 0. So the output would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which doesn't match the example's output of [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. So this is not correct.\n\nBut the example's output for the second row is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. This suggests that the transformation is not based on position 0 and 10.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll have to make a guess that the transformation is to take certain positions from the input and repeat them, and fill the rest with zeros. For example, in the first row of example 1, the positions 0 and 10 are taken. In the second row of example 1, the positions 0 and 10 are 0 and 0, but the output is 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4. This doesn't fit, so this is not the correct pattern.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to proceed with the assumption that the transformation is to take certain positions and repeat them. For example, in the first row of example 1, the first two elements are 2, which is the value at position 0, and the last two elements are 4, which is the value at position 10. So the code would take the value at position 0 and repeat it, then the value at position 10 and repeat it.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to take.\n\nAlternatively, the code could take the first non-zero value and repeat it twice, then the next non-zero value and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor each row in the input, iterate through the columns, collect non-zero values, and repeat each twice, then fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut this would require that the number of non-zero values is such that the total number of elements is 11.\n\nFor example, in the first row of example 1, there are 4 non-zero values (2, 3, 4, 8). But the output has 2 non-zero values (2 and 4). So this is not the case.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation is to take the first non-zero value in the row and repeat it twice, then take the next non-zero value and repeat it twice, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Find the first non-zero value, repeat it twice.\n- Find the next non-zero value, repeat it twice.\n- Fill the rest with zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nNow, let's try to implement this.\n\nFor example, in the first row of example 1, the first non-zero is 2, then the next is 3, then 4, then 8. So the output would be 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. But this doesn't match the example's output.\n\nThis is not correct.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the code that takes the first non-zero value and repeats it, and the last non-zero value and repeats it, and fills the rest with zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, for each row in the input:\n\n- Find the first non-zero value, say v1.\n- Find the last non-zero value, say v2.\n- The output row is [v1, v1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, v2, v2].\n\nBut in example 1's first row, v1 is 2, v2 is 8. So the output would be [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], which doesn't match the example's output of [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]. So this is not correct.\n\nBut in the example's output, the last non-zero value is 4, not 8. So this suggests that the code is not taking the last non-zero value, but some other value.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to proceed with a different approach. Perhaps the transformation is to take the first non-zero value and repeat it twice, then take the next non-zero value and repeat it twice, and so on, but only up to a certain number of elements.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's difficult to proceed.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code that takes the first non-zero value and repeats it twice, and the next non-zero value and repeats it twice, and fills the rest with zeros. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        # Find first non-zero value\n        first_non_zero = None\n        for val in row:\n            if val != 0:\n                first_non_zero = val\n                break\n        # Find second non-zero value\n        second_non_zero = None\n        for val in row:\n            if val != 0 and (first_non_zero is not None and val != first_non_zero):\n                second_non_zero = val\n                break\n        # Create the new row\n        new_row = [first_non_zero, first_non_zero] + [0] * 7 + [second_non_zero, second_non_zero]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, this code would not handle the examples correctly, but it's the best I can do given the time.\n\nBut looking at example 1's first row, this code would take first_non_zero as 2, second_non_zero as 3, and the new_row would be [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3], which doesn't match the example's output.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to give up and write a code that takes certain positions from the input, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking every other column from the input, but with some transformation. For example, in example 1's first row, the input has 20 columns. The output has 11 columns. So 20 columns to 11. This could be 20 columns to 11 by taking every other column, but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in example 1's first row, the output is 11 columns, which could be columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. But this would give the input's first 11 columns, which doesn't match the example's output.\n\nBut the example's output is [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4], which is not the same as the input's first 11 columns.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with the assumption that the transformation is to take certain positions from the input and repeat them, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll write a function that takes the first non-zero value and repeats it twice, and the next non-zero value and repeats it twice, and fills the rest with zeros. Even though this is not correct for the examples, it's the best I can do.\n"
