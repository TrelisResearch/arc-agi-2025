The input grid has a consistent structure with alternating rows of all 0s and 1s (or other numbers) and rows of all the same number (like 1s, 3s, 8s).\n2. The output grid seems to modify the values in certain positions, particularly in the middle of the grid, by replacing some values with higher numbers (like 3s becoming 3s, 2s becoming 3s, etc.).\n3. There's a pattern where certain positions in the grid are modified based on their position relative to the center of the grid.\n4. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with higher values in specific patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values in the grid based on their position relative to the center.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the size of the grid\n    size = len(grid)\n    \n    # Define the center of the grid\n    center = size // 2\n    \n    # Define the pattern of values to replace\n    # In the training examples, values in the middle of the grid are replaced with higher values\n    # We'll replace values in the middle rows and columns with higher values\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            # Check if we are in the middle of the grid\n            if abs(i - center) < 2 and abs(j - center) < 2:\n                # Replace the value with a higher value (e.g., 3)\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the size of the grid\n    size = len(grid)\n    \n    # Define the center of the grid\n    center = size // 2\n    \n    # Define the pattern of values to replace\n    # In the training examples, values in the middle of the grid are replaced with higher values\n    # We'll replace values in the middle rows and columns with higher values\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            # Check if we are in the middle of the grid\n            if abs(i - center) < 2 and abs(j - center) < 2:\n                # Replace the value with a higher value (e.g., 3)\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The input grid has a consistent structure with alternating rows of all 0s and 1s (or other numbers) and rows of all the same number (like 1s, 3s, 8s).\n2. The output grid seems to modify the values in certain positions, particularly in the middle of the grid, by replacing some values with higher numbers (like 3s becoming 3s, 2s becoming 3s, etc.).\n3. There's a pattern where certain positions in the grid are modified based on their position relative to the center of the grid.\n4. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with higher values in specific patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values in the grid based on their position relative to the center.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the size of the grid\n    size = len(grid)\n    \n    # Define the center of the grid\n    center = size // 2\n    \n    # Define the pattern of values to replace\n    # In the training examples, values in the middle of the grid are replaced with higher values\n    # We'll replace values in the middle rows and columns with higher values\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            # Check if we are in the middle of the grid\n            if abs(i - center) < 2 and abs(j - center) < 2:\n                # Replace the value with a higher value (e.g., 3)\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the size of the grid\n    size = len(grid)\n    \n    # Define the center of the grid\n    center = size // 2\n    \n    # Define the pattern of values to replace\n    # In the training examples, values in the middle of the grid are replaced with higher values\n    # We'll replace values in the middle rows and columns with higher values\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            # Check if we are in the middle of the grid\n            if abs(i - center) < 2 and abs(j - center) < 2:\n                # Replace the value with a higher value (e.g., 3)\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
