The center cell is the only one that remains unchanged, while all other cells are filled with the value from the center cell.\n\nFor example:\n- In Example 1, the center cell is 2, so all cells are filled with 2.\n- In Example 2, the center cell is 3, so all cells are filled with 3.\n- In Example 3, the center cell is 1, so all cells are filled with 1.\n- In Example 4, the center cell is 6, so all cells are filled with 6.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is to replace all 0s with the value of the center cell, and leave other values unchanged.\n\nHere's the Python function that implements this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the center cell\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    center_row = rows // 2\n    center_col = cols // 2\n    \n    # Get the value of the center cell\n    center_value = grid[center_row][center_col]\n    \n    # Create a new grid with the same dimensions\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    # Fill the new grid with the center value where the original was 0\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = center_value\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
