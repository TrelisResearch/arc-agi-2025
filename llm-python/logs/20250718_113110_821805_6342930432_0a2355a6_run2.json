              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe that the transformation involves identifying patterns of 8s and replacing them with specific values based on their position and context. The transformation seems to involve:\n\n1. Replacing sequences of 8s with specific numbers (like 1, 2, 3, 4)\n2. The replacement depends on the position and the surrounding values\n3. The transformation appears to be based on patterns of 8s and their neighbors\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces sequences of 8s with specific values based on their position and context.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the replacement values based on patterns observed\n    replacement_values = {\n        1: [1, 1, 1, 1],\n        2: [2, 2, 2, 2],\n        3: [3, 3, 3, 3],\n        4: [4, 4, 4, 4]\n    }\n    \n    # Define the replacement pattern based on the position of 8s\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on observations from the training examples\n    # More complex patterns would require more detailed analysis\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(11):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Check the surrounding cells to determine the replacement value\n                # This is a simplified pattern based on observations\n                if i < 2 and j < 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif i < 2 and j > 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif i > 6 and j < 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif i > 6 and j > 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif i < 2 and j < 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif i > 6 and j < 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif i < 2 and j > 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif i > 6 and j > 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif i < 2 and j > 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif i > 6 and j > 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                # This is a simplified pattern and may not capture all cases\n                # More complex patterns would require more detailed analysis\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the replacement values based on patterns observed\n    replacement_values = {\n        1: [1, 1, 1, 1],\n        2: [2, 2, 2, 2],\n        3: [3, 3, 3, 3],\n        4: [4, 4, 4, 4]\n    }\n    \n    # Define the replacement pattern based on the position of 8s\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on observations\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(11):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Check the surrounding cells to determine the replacement value\n                # This is a simplified pattern based on observations\n                if i < 2 and j < 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif i < 2 and j > 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif i > 6 and j < 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif i > 6 and j > 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif i < 2 and j < 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif i > 6 and j < 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif i < 2 and j > 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif i > 6 and j > 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif i < 2 and j > 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif i > 6 and j > 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                # This is a simplified pattern and may not capture all cases\n                # More complex patterns would require more detailed analysis\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
