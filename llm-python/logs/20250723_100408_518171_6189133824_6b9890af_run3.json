          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid is always 8x8, so the transformation must reduce the input grid to 8x8 dimensions.\n2. The input grids have 25 rows (each with 25 columns), and the output grids have 8 rows (each with 8 columns).\n3. The transformation seems to involve selecting specific rows and columns from the input grid, and applying some kind of pattern transformation.\n4. In Example 1, the output grid seems to be formed by taking specific rows from the input and applying a pattern of 2s and 8s.\n5. In Example 2, the output grid seems to be formed by taking specific rows from the input and applying a pattern of 2s and 1s.\n6. In Example 3, the output grid seems to be formed by taking specific rows from the input and applying a pattern of 2s and 4s.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Selecting specific rows from the input grid\n- Applying a pattern transformation to those rows\n- Ensuring the output is always 8x8\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Extract specific rows from the input grid\n    selected_rows = [grid[2], grid[3], grid[4], grid[5], grid[6], grid[7], grid[15], grid[16]]\n    \n    # Apply pattern transformation to each selected row\n    transformed_rows = []\n    for row in selected_rows:\n        # Create a new row with 8 elements\n        new_row = []\n        for i in range(8):\n            if i == 0 or i == 7:\n                new_row.append(2)\n            elif i == 1 or i == 6:\n                new_row.append(8)\n            elif i == 2 or i == 5:\n                new_row.append(8)\n            elif i == 3 or i == 4:\n                new_row.append(8)\n        transformed_rows.append(new_row)\n    \n    return transformed_rows\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Extract specific rows from the input grid\n    selected_rows = [grid[2], grid[3], grid[4], grid[5], grid[6], grid[7], grid[15], grid[16]]\n    \n    # Apply pattern transformation to each selected row\n    transformed_rows = []\n    for row in selected_rows:\n        # Create a new row with 8 elements\n        new_row = []\n        for i in range(8):\n            if i == 0 or i == 7:\n                new_row.append(2)\n            elif i == 1 or i == 6:\n                new_row.append(8)\n            elif i == 2 or i == 5:\n                new_row.append(8)\n            elif i == 3 or i == 4:\n                new_row.append(8)\n        transformed_rows.append(new_row)\n    \n    return transformed_rows\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation involves:\n1. Identifying regions of numbers (like 2s, 8s, 4s, etc.)\n2. Converting those regions to a specific pattern\n3. Creating a new grid where these regions are transformed into a specific shape\n\nFrom the examples, it seems like the transformation involves:\n- Creating a new grid where certain numbers are replaced with a specific pattern\n- The pattern seems to be a diamond or cross shape\n- The transformation seems to involve replacing certain numbers with a specific pattern based on their position\n\nHere's my best hypothesis for the transformation:\n\n1. For each cell in the input grid:\n   - If the cell is 0, it remains 0\n   - If the cell is 2, it becomes part of a diamond shape\n   - If the cell is 8, it becomes part of a diamond shape\n   - If the cell is 4, it becomes part of a diamond shape\n   - If the cell is 3, it becomes part of a diamond shape\n\n2. The diamond shape is formed by surrounding the number with 0s and then replacing the surrounding cells with the number\n\nBased on this pattern, here's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the size of the grid\n    size = len(grid)\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            # If the cell is 0, leave it as is\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # Check if the cell is at the edge of the grid\n            if i == 0 or i == size - 1 or j == 0 or j == size - 1:\n                # If it's at the edge, we need to create a diamond shape\n                # We'll create a diamond shape around this cell\n                # The diamond will have a size of 3 (center, up, down, left, right)\n                # We'll replace the surrounding cells with the value of this cell\n                # We'll also replace the center cell with the value of this cell\n                # We'll create a diamond shape with the value of this cell\n                #

The output grids seem to have certain values (like 2, 8, 4, 3) that appear in specific patterns\n2. The values seem to be related to the positions of the input values (especially 2, 8, 4, 3)\n3. There appears to be some kind of transformation where certain values are replaced or modified based on their position and value\n4. The output grids seem to have a specific shape or pattern that is derived from the input grid\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Identifies certain values (like 2, 8, 4, 3) in the input grid\n- Applies specific transformations to these values based on their position and value\n- Creates a new 8x8 output grid that reflects these transformations\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]\n    \n    # Process each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(len(grid)):\n        for col in range(len(grid[row])):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # Special case for value 3\n            if value == 3:\n                # Place 3 in the center of the output grid\n                output[3][3] = 3\n            \n            # Special case for value 2\n            elif value == 2:\n                # Place 2 in the center of the output grid\n                output[3][3] = 2\n            \n            # Special case for value 8\n            elif value == 8:\n                # Place 8 in the center of the output grid\n                output[3][3] = 8\n            \n            # Special case for value 4\n            elif value == 4:\n                # Place 4 in the center of the output grid\n                output[3][3] = 4\n            \n            # For other values, leave as 0\n            # This is a simple placeholder and may need refinement\n            # Based on the examples, it seems like we're focusing on specific values\n            # and transforming them in specific ways\n    \n    return output\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]\n    \n    # Process each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(len(grid)):\n        for col in range(len(grid[row])):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # Special case for value 3\n            if value == 3:\n                # Place 3 in the center of the output grid\n                output[3][3] = 3\n            \n            # Special case for value 2\n            elif value == 2:\n                # Place 2 in the center of the output grid\n                output[3][3] = 2\n            \n            # Special case for value 8\n            elif value == 8:\n                # Place 8 in the center of the output grid\n                output[3][3] = 8\n            \n            # Special case for value 4\n            elif value == 4:\n                # Place 4 in the center of the output grid\n                output[3][3] = 4\n            \n            # For other values, leave as 0\n            # This is a simple placeholder and may need refinement\n            # Based on the examples, it seems like we're focusing on specific values\n            # and transforming them in specific ways\n    \n    return output\n```",
