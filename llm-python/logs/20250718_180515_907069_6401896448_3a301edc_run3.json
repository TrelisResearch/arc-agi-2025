          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others based on their position and value.\n2. There's a pattern where certain values (like 4, 5, 6, 8) are replaced with other values (like 2, 3, 5, 5) in specific regions.\n3. The transformation often involves expanding or contracting certain regions of the grid.\n4. Values in the middle of the grid seem to be more affected by the transformation than values on the edges.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values with others based on their position and value\n- Expanding or contracting certain regions of the grid\n- Preserving the overall structure of the grid but modifying specific regions\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex rules might be needed for perfect accuracy\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Leave 0s unchanged\n                continue\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4s with 5s in certain positions\n                if i >= 2 and i <= 7 and j >= 3 and j <= 5:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace 5s with 5s in certain positions\n                if i >= 2 and i <= 7 and j >= 3 and j <= 5:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace 6s with 2s in certain positions\n                if i >= 3 and i <= 6 and j >= 3 and j <= 5:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8s with 2s in certain positions\n                if i >= 7 and i <= 9 and j >= 6 and j <= 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace 3s with 2s in certain positions\n                if i >= 7 and i <= 9 and j >= 6 and j <= 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Keep 2s as they are\n                continue\n            elif grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Keep 1s as they are\n                continue\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # Keep 7s as they are\n                continue\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                # Keep 9s as they are\n                continue\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

There appears to be a \"border\" of 0s that remains unchanged, with transformations happening in the inner regions.\n3. Values like 4, 5, 6, 8, and 2 seem to be transformed based on their position and neighboring values.\n4. There's a pattern where certain values are replaced with others in a way that forms a \"ring\" or \"border\" around certain regions.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Leaves the outermost layer of 0s unchanged\n- Replaces certain values with others in a way that forms a \"ring\" or \"border\" around certain regions\n- Preserves the overall structure of the grid\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex rules could be added if needed\n    \n    # Replace certain values with others based on their position\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 5 in certain positions\n                if i >= 3 and i <= 9 and j >= 4 and j <= 14:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with 4 in certain positions\n                if i >= 3 and i <= 9 and j >= 4 and j <= 14:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace 6 with 4 in certain positions\n                if i >= 3 and i <= 9 and j >= 4 and j <= 14:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8 with 2 in certain positions\n                if i >= 3 and i <= 9 and j >= 4 and j <= 14:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 8 in certain positions\n                if i >= 3 and i <= 9 and j >= 4 and j <= 14:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Replace 1 with 2 in certain positions\n                if i >= 3 and i <= 9 and j >= 4 and j <= 14:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace 3 with 5 in certain positions\n                if i >= 3 and i <= 9 and j >= 4 and j <= 14:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
