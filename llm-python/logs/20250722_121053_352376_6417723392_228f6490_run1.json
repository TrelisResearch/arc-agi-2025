In Example 1, the output seems to replace certain values with 8s in specific positions.\n2. In Example 2, values are replaced with 3s in specific positions.\n3. In Example 3, values are replaced with 0s in specific positions.\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their position and value.\n\nHere's my best guess at the transformation pattern:\n\n- Replace 5 with 8 in certain positions\n- Replace 2 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 3 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 7 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 8 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 9 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 4 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 6 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 0 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 5 with 8 in certain positions\n\nI'll implement this pattern in code.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace 5 with 8 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5 and (i == 2 or i == 3 or j == 2 or j == 3):\n                transformed[i][j] = 8\n                \n    # Replace 2 with 0 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2 and (i == 1 or i == 2 or j == 1 or j == 2):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n                \n    # Replace 3 with 0 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3 and (i == 5 or i == 6 or j == 5 or j == 6):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n                \n    # Replace 7 with 0 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 7 and (i == 7 or i == 8 or j == 7 or j == 8):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n                \n    # Replace 8 with 0 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8 and (i == 8 or i == 9 or j == 8 or j == 9):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n                \n    # Replace 9 with 0 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 9 and (i == 7 or i == 8 or j == 7 or j == 8):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n                \n    # Replace 4 with 0 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4 and (i == 3 or i == 4 or j == 3 or j == 4):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n                \n    # Replace 6 with 0 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 6 and (i == 7 or i == 8 or j == 7 or j == 8):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n                \n    return transformed\n```",

In Example 1, the output seems to replace certain values with 8s in specific positions.\n2. In Example 2, values are replaced with 3s in specific positions.\n3. In Example 3, values are replaced with 0s in specific positions.\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their position and value.\n\nHere's my best guess at the transformation pattern:\n\n- Replace 5 with 8 in certain positions\n- Replace 2 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 3 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 7 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 8 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 9 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 4 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 6 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 0 with 0 in certain positions\n- Replace 5 with 8 in certain positions\n\nI'll implement this pattern in code.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace 5 with 8 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5 and (i == 2 or i == 3 or j == 2 or j == 3):\n                transformed[i][j] = 8\n                \n    # Replace 2 with 0 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2 and (i == 1 or i == 2 or j == 1 or j == 2):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n                \n    # Replace 3 with 0 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3 and (i == 5 or i == 6 or j == 5 or j == 6):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n                \n    # Replace 7 with 0 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 7 and (i == 7 or i == 8 or j == 7 or j == 8):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n                \n    # Replace 8 with 0 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8 and (i == 8 or i == 9 or j == 8 or j == 9):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n                \n    # Replace 9 with 0 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 9 and (i == 7 or i == 8 or j == 7 or j == 8):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n                \n    # Replace 4 with 0 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4 and (i == 3 or i == 4 or j == 3 or j == 4):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n                \n    # Replace 6 with 0 in specific positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 6 and (i == 7 or i == 8 or j == 7 or j == 8):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n                \n    return transformed\n```",
