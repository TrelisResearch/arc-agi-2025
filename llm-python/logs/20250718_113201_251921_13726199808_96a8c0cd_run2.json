The output grid always has a specific structure, with some cells being filled with 2s or 3s in specific patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads values (like 3 and 2) to neighboring cells in a way that matches the patterns in the training examples.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Spread values 3 and 2 to neighboring cells\n    # This is a simplified version of the pattern observed\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                # Spread 3 to neighboring cells\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 12 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = 3\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                # Spread 2 to neighboring cells\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 12 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = 2\n    \n    # Additional pattern observed: replace 0s with 2s in certain patterns\n    # This is a simplified version of the pattern observed\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if this cell is in a pattern that should be replaced with 2\n                if (i % 3 == 0 and j % 3 == 0) or (i % 3 == 1 and j % 3 == 1):\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 12 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = 3\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 12 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = 2\n    \n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 0:\n                if (i % 3 == 0 and j % 3 == 0) or (i % 3 == 1 and j % 3 == 1):\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed.tolist()\n```",

The transformation seems to involve spreading or propagating certain values (like 3 and 2) to neighboring cells.\n2. Values like 3 and 2 appear to be \"inflated\" or \"spread\" to adjacent cells in a way that creates patterns.\n3. The transformation often involves replacing 0s with 2s or 3s in certain patterns.\n4. The output grid always has a specific structure, with some cells being filled with 2s or 3s in specific patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads values (like 3 and 2) to neighboring cells in a way that matches the patterns in the training examples.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Spread values 3 and 2 to neighboring cells\n    # This is a simplified version of the pattern observed\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                # Spread 3 to neighboring cells\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 12 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = 3\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                # Spread 2 to neighboring cells\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 12 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = 2\n    \n    # Additional pattern observed: replace 0s with 2s in certain patterns\n    # This is a simplified version of the pattern observed\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if this cell is in a pattern that should be replaced with 2\n                if (i % 3 == 0 and j % 3 == 0) or (i % 3 == 1 and j % 3 == 1):\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 12 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = 3\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 12 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = 2\n    \n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 0:\n                if (i % 3 == 0 and j % 3 == 0) or (i % 3 == 1 and j % 3 == 1):\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed.tolist()\n```",
