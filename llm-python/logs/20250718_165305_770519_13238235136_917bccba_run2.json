The output grid often has 0s in the top-left and bottom-right corners\n2. There are patterns of 3s and 2s that seem to be transformed into 0s and 3s\n3. The 8s in example 2 seem to be transformed into 0s\n4. The 4s in example 3 seem to be transformed into 0s and 4s\n5. There are patterns of 3s and 2s that seem to be transformed into 0s and 3s\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values with 0s\n- Keeping some values unchanged\n- Creating patterns of 3s and 0s\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid

The transformation seems to involve some form of \"expansion\" or \"filling\" of certain regions in the grid.\n2. Values of 3 and 8 in the input seem to be replaced with 0s in the output, while values of 2 and 4 seem to be preserved or transformed in specific patterns.\n3. There appears to be a pattern where certain regions are \"filled\" with 0s or other values based on their position and value.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values (like 3 and 8) with 0s\n- Expanding or filling certain regions based on their position and value\n- Preserving or transforming values in specific patterns\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(12):\n            # If the cell value is 3 or 8, replace it with 0\n            if transformed[i][j] in (3, 8):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            # If the cell value is 2, check its neighbors\n            elif transformed[i][j] == 2:\n                # Check if the cell is in a region that should be expanded\n                # This is a simplified check based on observed patterns\n                if (i >= 2 and i <= 6) and (j >= 2 and j <= 6):\n                    # Expand the 2 to 3 in specific patterns\n                    if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(12):\n            # If the cell value is 3 or 8, replace it with 0\n            if transformed[i][j] in (3, 8):\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            # If the cell value is 2, check its neighbors\n            elif transformed[i][j] == 2:\n                # Check if the cell is in a region that should be expanded\n                # This is a simplified check based on observed patterns\n                if (i >= 2 and i <= 6) and (j >= 2 and j <= 6):\n                    # Expand the 2 to 3 in specific patterns\n                    if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
