In Example 1, the 3's form a sort of \"X\" shape that gets transformed into a more spread-out pattern.\n2. In Example 2, the 2's form a sort of \"snake\" pattern that gets transformed into a more spread-out pattern with some symmetry.\n3. In Example 3, the 5's form a sort of \"cross\" pattern that gets transformed into a more spread-out pattern with some symmetry.\n4. In Example 4, the 8's form a sort of \"snake\" pattern that gets transformed into a more spread-out pattern with some symmetry.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading out patterns of numbers and possibly rotating or reflecting them.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = np.copy(grid_np)\n    \n    # Define the transformation logic based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version that attempts to spread out patterns\n    # and possibly rotate or reflect them\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread out the value to adjacent cells\n                for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                        if 0 <= ni < 13 and 0 <= nj < 14:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    # Apply some symmetry transformation\n    # This is a simple reflection across the vertical axis\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(7):\n            transformed_grid[i][j], transformed_grid[i][13-j-1] = transformed_grid[i][13-j-1], transformed_grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = np.copy(grid_np)\n    \n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                        if 0 <= ni < 13 and 0 <= nj < 14:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(7):\n            transformed_grid[i][j], transformed_grid[i][13-j-1] = transformed_grid[i][13-j-1], transformed_grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
