    "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to identify the pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n- Input: Two rectangular blocks of 5s\n- Output: The larger 5x5 block of 5s remains mostly unchanged, but the smaller 4x3 block of 5s gets modified\n- In the output, some 5s in the interior of blocks are changed to 2s\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n- Input: Two separate rectangular blocks of 5s\n- Output: Interior 5s in both blocks are changed to 2s, creating a border pattern\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Identify connected components of the same non-zero value\n2. For each connected component that forms a rectangle of sufficient size, change the interior values while keeping the border intact\n3. Specifically, change interior cells from 5 to 2\n\nLet me refine this:\n- Find rectangular regions of the same color\n- If the region is large enough (more than 2x2), keep the outer border unchanged but change inner cells to a different value (2)\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- In example 1: The 5x5 block keeps its border of 5s, inner 3x3 becomes 2s\n- In example 2: The 6x5 block keeps its border of 5s, inner 4x3 becomes 2s\n- The second block (4x3) keeps its border of 5s, inner 2x1 becomes 2s\n\nThe transformation appears to be: for each connected rectangular region of the same color, if it's large enough, replace the interior (non-border) cells with value 2.\n\nLet me implement this:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import copy\n    \n    # Create a deep copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    result = copy.deepcopy(grid)\n    \n    # Find rectangular regions of the same non-zero value\n    # For simplicity, let's focus on value 5 as seen in examples\n    \n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Check if there's a rectangular region of 5s\n    # We'll look for bounding boxes of 5s and modify their interiors\n    \n    # Find all positions with value 5\n    positions_of_5 = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                positions_of_5.append((r, c))\n    \n    if not positions_of_5:\n        return result\n    \n    # Find bounding box of all 5s\n    min_r = min(pos[0] for pos in positions_of_5)\n    max_r = max(pos[0] for pos in positions_of_5)\n    min_c = min(pos[1] for pos in positions_of_5)\n    max_c = max(pos[1] for pos in positions_of_5)\n    \n    # Check if this forms a solid rectangle of 5s\n    is_rectangle = True\n    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):\n        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):\n            if grid[r][c] != 5:\n                is_rectangle = False\n                break\n        if not is_rectangle:\n            break\n    \n    # If it's a solid rectangle and large enough, modify interior\n    if is_rectangle and (max_r -

Identify connected components of the same non-zero value\n2. For each connected component that forms a rectangle of sufficient size, change the interior values while keeping the border intact\n3. Specifically, change interior cells from 5 to 2\n\nLet me refine this:\n- Find rectangular regions of the same color\n- If the region is large enough (more than 2x2), keep the outer border unchanged but change inner cells to a different value (2)\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- In example 1: The 5x5 block keeps its border of 5s, inner 3x3 becomes 2s\n- In example 2: The 6x5 block keeps its border of 5s, inner 4x3 becomes 2s\n- The second block (4x3) keeps its border of 5s, inner 2x1 becomes 2s\n\nThe transformation appears to be: for each connected rectangular region of the same color, if it's large enough, replace the interior (non-border) cells with value 2.\n\nLet me implement this:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import copy\n    \n    # Create a deep copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    result = copy.deepcopy(grid)\n    \n    # Find rectangular regions of the same non-zero value\n    # For simplicity, let's focus on value 5 as seen in examples\n    \n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Check if there's a rectangular region of 5s\n    # We'll look for bounding boxes of 5s and modify their interiors\n    \n    # Find all positions with value 5\n    positions_of_5 = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                positions_of_5.append((r, c))\n    \n    if not positions_of_5:\n        return result\n    \n    # Find bounding box of all 5s\n    min_r = min(pos[0] for pos in positions_of_5)\n    max_r = max(pos[0] for pos in positions_of_5)\n    min_c = min(pos[1] for pos in positions_of_5)\n    max_c = max(pos[1] for pos in positions_of_5)\n    \n    # Check if this forms a solid rectangle of 5s\n    is_rectangle = True\n    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):\n        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):\n            if grid[r][c] != 5:\n                is_rectangle = False\n                break\n        if not is_rectangle:\n            break\n    \n    # If it's a solid rectangle and large enough, modify interior\n    if is_rectangle and (max_r -
