The value 2 seems to propagate outward in a wave-like pattern, expanding to adjacent cells in a specific order.\n\nFrom the examples, I can infer that:\n1. The value 2 in the input grid is spread to neighboring cells in a specific pattern.\n2. The spread follows a wave-like pattern, expanding outward from the original position.\n3. The spread seems to follow a diagonal pattern, expanding in a specific order.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that spreads the value 2 from its original position to neighboring cells in a specific pattern.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Find the position of the value 2 in the input grid\n    pos = np.where(grid_np == 2)\n    if len(pos[0]) == 0:\n        # No 2 found, return the original grid\n        return grid\n    \n    # Get the position of the 2\n    x, y = pos[0][0], pos[1][0]\n    \n    # Create a 10x10 output grid initialized to 0\n    output = np.zeros((10, 10), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Spread the value 2 in a wave-like pattern\n    # This is a simplified version of the pattern observed in the examples\n    # We'll spread the value in a diagonal pattern, expanding outward\n    # This is a simplified implementation that captures the observed pattern\n    \n    # Initialize the output grid with the value 2 at the original position\n    output[x][y] = 2\n    \n    # Spread the value in a wave-like pattern\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), (1, -1), (0, -1), (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1)]\n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        for step in range(1, 10):\n            nx, ny = x + dx * step, y + dy * step\n            if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10:\n                output[nx][ny] = 2\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return output.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    pos = np.where(grid_np == 2)\n    if len(pos[0]) == 0:\n        return grid\n    \n    x, y = pos[0][0], pos[1][0]\n    \n    output = np.zeros((10, 10), dtype=int)\n    output[x][y] = 2\n    \n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), (1, -1), (0, -1), (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1)]\n    for dx, dy in directions:\n        for step in range(1, 10):\n            nx, ny = x + dx * step, y + dy * step\n            if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10:\n                output[nx][ny] = 2\n    \n    return output.tolist()\n```",
