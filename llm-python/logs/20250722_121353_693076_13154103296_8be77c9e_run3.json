The input grid is 3x3. It seems like the output is a transformation of the input grid that repeats or extends it in some way.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n1. The output grid is a vertical extension of the input grid, with the input grid repeated in some pattern\n2. The pattern seems to be a reflection or mirroring of the input grid\n3. The output grid has a symmetric pattern around the middle row\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Takes the input grid (3x3)\n- Creates a 6x3 output grid\n- Repeats the input grid in a symmetric pattern\n\nHere's my hypothesis for the transformation:\n\nThe output grid is formed by:\n- The input grid as the first 3 rows\n- The input grid mirrored (reversed) as the last 3 rows\n\nLet's implement this pattern.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 6x3 output grid\n    transformed_grid = []\n    \n    # Add the original input grid as the first 3 rows\n    for row in grid:\n        transformed_grid.append(row)\n    \n    # Add the reversed input grid as the last 3 rows\n    for row in reversed(grid):\n        transformed_grid.append(row)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
