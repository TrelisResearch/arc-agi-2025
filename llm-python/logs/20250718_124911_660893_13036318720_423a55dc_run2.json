          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a 10x11 grid. The output is also 10x11. The input has some 8s in the third row, and in the middle rows, there are 8s forming a sort of vertical line. The output seems to have those 8s moved to the left, but not sure. Wait, in the input, the third row is 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 8s are shifted to the left. But then in the fourth row of input, there's 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 8s are moved to the left? Wait, the original input's fourth row has 8s at positions 2 and 6 (assuming 0-based index). The output's fourth row has 8 at position 3. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, maybe the 8s are being expanded or spread out in some way.\n\nWait, maybe the 8s are being transformed into a certain shape. Let me think about the output of example 1. The third row in the output has 8s in the first three positions, then zeros. The fourth row has an 8 in the fourth position. The fifth row has an 8 in the second position. The sixth row has an 8 in the third position. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where the 8s are being spread out in a certain way. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are being moved to the left, but not sure.\n\nLooking at example 2: The input has 6s in the fourth row. The output for that row has 6s in the first three positions. Then in the fifth row of input, there's 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 6s are moving to the left? Like, in the fifth row of input, the 6s are at positions 4 and 6. In the output, they are at positions 1 and 3. Hmm, maybe the 6s are being spread out in a way that they are placed in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 6s are being transformed into a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are in a vertical line in the third row, and in the output, they are spread out to the left. But then in the fourth row, there's an 8 in the middle, but in the output, it's moved left. Maybe the pattern is that the 8s are being replaced by a certain shape, like a cross or something else.\n\nLooking at example 3: The input has a 3 in the fourth row, and the output has a 3 in the fourth row but shifted. The input has 3s in positions 6,7,8 (assuming 0-based), and the output has them in positions 3,4,5. So maybe the 3s are being moved to the left. But the input is 13 columns (since the first example is 11 columns, but example 3 has 13 columns? Wait, the first example is 10 rows, 11 columns. The third example's input is 10 rows, 13 columns? Wait, the input for example 3 is given as 13 columns. So maybe the pattern is that certain numbers are being moved to the left, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in a vertical line in the input, and in the output, they are spread out in a way that they form a horizontal line. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 4: The input has 2s in the fourth row, and the output has them shifted left. The input's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2s are moved to the left. Then in the fifth row of input, the 2s are in positions 4 and 8 (assuming 0-based), but the output has them in positions 0 and 1. Wait, no, the input fifth row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. The output is 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2s are moved to the left. So maybe the pattern is that for certain numbers, they are being moved to the left, but how?\n\nAnother observation: In example 1, the input has 8s in the third row, and the output has them in the first three columns. The fourth row of input has 8s in positions 2 and 6 (0-based?), but in the output, the 8 is in position 3. Wait, maybe the 8s are being spread out in a way that they are placed in certain positions. But this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 8s, 6s, 3s, and 2s are being transformed into a certain shape, such as a cross or a line. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are in a vertical line. The output has them spread out in a horizontal line. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being replaced by a certain pattern based on their positions. For example, the numbers in the input are being replaced by a certain shape, such as a cross, where the 8s in the input are transformed into a cross shape. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed based on their positions. For example, in the input, certain positions have numbers, and in the output, those numbers are moved to the left. For example, in example 1, the third row has 8s in positions 2-6 (columns 2 to 6?), and the output has them in columns 0-2. Then in the fourth row of input, the 8s are in columns 2 and 6, but in the output, they are moved to column 3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed based on their positions in the grid. For example, the numbers in the input are being replaced by a certain pattern that depends on their position. For example, if a cell has a number, then in the output, it's replaced by a certain value based on some rule.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of example 1. The output has the 8s in the third row as the first three columns. The fourth row of output has an 8 in the fourth column. The fifth row has an 8 in the second column. The sixth row has an 8 in the third column. The seventh row has 8s in columns 3-7. Wait, this seems like a pattern where the 8s are being spread out in a way that they form a certain shape. For example, the third row has 8s in the first three columns, then the fourth row has an 8 in the fourth column. The fifth row has an 8 in the second column, and so on. Maybe this is a pattern where the 8s are being spread out in a way that they form a certain shape, like a cross or a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed based on their position in the grid. For example, in the input, certain numbers are present in certain positions, and in the output, they are moved to the left. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are moved to the left. Similarly, in example 2, the 6s are moved to the left. In example 3, the 3s are moved to the left. In example 4, the 2s are moved to the left.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for each number in the input, it's being moved to the left as much as possible, but only in certain positions. But how?\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the numbers are being transformed into a certain shape. For example, in example 1, the 8s form a vertical line in the input, and in the output, they are spread out to form a horizontal line. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being replaced by a certain pattern based on their position. For example, if a cell is part of a certain shape, then it's replaced by a certain value. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in a vertical line, and in the output, they are spread out to form a horizontal line. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a cross shape. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are in a vertical line, and in the output, they are spread out to form a cross. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being transformed based on their position in the grid. For example, the 8s in the input are in certain rows and columns, and in the output, they are moved to the left. For example, in example 1, the third row has 8s in columns 2-6, and in the output, they are moved to columns 0-2. Then the fourth row has 8s in columns 2 and 6, and in the output, they are moved to column 3. But how?\n\nAnother observation: In example 1, the output for the third row is 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So three 8s in the first three columns. The fourth row in the output is 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So an 8 in column 3. The fifth row is 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, no. Wait the fifth row of the output is 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0? Or is that the sixth row? Let me check example 1 again.\n\nExample 1's output:\n\nRow 3: 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\nSo, for row 5, the output has 8 in column 0 and 4. Hmm, that's not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by a certain shape. For example, the 8s in the input are part of a vertical line, and in the output, they are transformed into a horizontal line. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of example 1. The third row in the output has three 8s. The fourth row has one 8. The fifth row has two 8s. The sixth row has two 8s. The seventh row has five 8s. This seems like a pattern where the 8s are being spread out in a way that forms a certain shape. Maybe the 8s are being spread out to form a cross shape. For example, the third row has three 8s, which could be part of a cross. Then the fourth row has one 8 in the middle. The fifth row has two 8s. Maybe this is a cross shape that expands outward.\n\nBut how to translate this into a transformation rule?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the input are being replaced by a certain pattern based on their positions. For example, if a cell is part of a certain shape, then it's replaced by a certain value. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother idea: The examples seem to have a pattern where certain numbers are being transformed into a cross shape. For example, in example 1, the 8s form a cross. In example 2, the 6s form a cross. In example 3, the 3s form a cross. In example 4, the 2s form a cross. So the transformation is that the numbers in the input are replaced by a cross shape, where the cross is centered in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine where the cross is?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a cross shape that is centered in the middle of the grid. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are in the third row, and in the output, they are spread out to form a cross. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the input are being replaced by a cross shape that is centered in the middle of the grid. For example, the input has a certain pattern, and the output has a cross shape that is formed by the numbers.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the left. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are moved to the left. For example, in the third row of input, the 8s are in columns 2-6. In the output, they are in columns 0-2. So they are moved left by two positions. Similarly, in the fourth row of input, the 8s are in columns 2 and 6. In the output, they are in column 3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a certain shape based on their position. For example, if a cell is part of a vertical line in the input, then in the output, it's part of a cross.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 3: 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 \u2192 Output row 3: 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 8s are moved to the left, but only the first three columns. So the 8s are spread out to the left. Similarly, in the fourth row of input, the 8s are in columns 2 and 6. The output has an 8 in column 3. So maybe the 8s are being moved to the left, but only in certain positions.\n\nAnother observation: In example 1, the output's seventh row has 8s in columns 3-7. The input's seventh row has 8s in columns 2-6. So they are moved to the left by one position. But this is not consistent with other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a certain shape based on their position. For example, the numbers are being replaced by a cross shape that is centered in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAnother idea: For each number in the input, if it's not zero, it's replaced by a cross shape centered at a certain position. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are in a vertical line, and in the output, they form a cross. But how to determine the center?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a cross shape that is centered in the middle of the grid. For example, the cross is formed by 8s in a certain pattern.\n\nBut how to determine the center for each input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by a cross shape that is centered at the same position as the original number. For example, if the input has an 8 in a certain position, then in the output, it's replaced by a cross that is centered there.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me think about the test input. The test input has a 10x13 grid. The input has 7s in certain positions. The output should be 10x11. Wait, no, the test input is given, but the output is not provided. But the problem says that the output must be 10x11. So the test input is 10 rows, 13 columns. The output is 10x11. So the transformation must reduce the number of columns from 13 to 11. But how?\n\nWait, the training examples have varying numbers of columns. For example, example 1 has 11 columns, example 2 has 11 columns, example 3 has 13 columns, example 4 has 13 columns. The test input has 13 columns. So the output must be 10x11 for all examples. So the transformation must reduce the number of columns from the input's columns to 11. But how?\n\nThis suggests that the transformation involves some kind of column reduction. For example, in example 3, the input has 13 columns, and the output has 11. So maybe the columns are being reduced by removing certain columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some pattern that depends on the input's structure. For example, the input has certain numbers in certain positions, and the output has those numbers in certain positions, possibly with some columns removed.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to think of a possible transformation rule that can explain the examples.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by replacing each non-zero number in the input with a certain pattern. For example, the number 8 in the input is replaced by a cross shape in the output. The cross shape is centered at the same position as the original number, but with a certain width.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers in the input are being replaced by a cross shape that extends in certain directions. For example, the number 8 is replaced by a cross that has arms in all directions.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a cross shape that is centered at the same row and column as the original number. For example, if there is an 8 in position (i,j), then in the output, there is a cross centered at (i,j), but only in certain directions.\n\nBut how to determine the size of the cross?\n\nAlternatively, the cross is formed by the same number, but with certain positions filled. For example, in example 1, the third row has 8s in columns 2-6. In the output, they are spread out to the left, forming a cross. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a cross shape that is centered at the same row and column as the original number. For example, if there is an 8 in position (i,j), then in the output, there is a cross centered at (i,j), with arms extending in certain directions. But how to determine the size of the cross?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the examples again. In example 1, the input has 8s in certain rows. The output has 8s in certain positions. For example, in the third row of input, the 8s are in columns 2-6. In the output, they are in columns 0-2. So they are moved left by two positions. In the fourth row of input, the 8s are in columns 2 and 6. In the output, the 8 is in column 3. So maybe the 8s are being moved to the left by a certain amount. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the left by a certain number of columns. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the third row are moved left by 2 columns. In the fourth row, the 8s are moved left by 1 column. This seems inconsistent, but perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the left based on their position in the grid. For example, if the number is in row i, then it's moved left by some function of i.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: The output for each row is formed by taking the input row and replacing the non-zero numbers with a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the third row of input has 8s in columns 2-6. In the output, those 8s are moved to the left, and the rest are zero. So maybe the non-zero numbers are being moved to the left as much as possible, but only in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero numbers are being moved to the left, but only up to a certain point. For example, in example 1, the third row's 8s are moved to the left to the first three columns. So the 8s are spread out to the left, but not overlapping with other 8s.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero numbers are moved to the left, but only up to a certain number of columns. For example, in example 1, the third row has 8s in columns 2-6, which are moved to the left to columns 0-2. But how to determine how many columns to move them?\n\nAlternatively, the number of columns to move is determined by the number of non-zero numbers in the row. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: In example 1, the output's third row has three 8s. The input's third row has five 8s. So the 8s are being reduced in number. But this seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by a certain pattern based on their positions. For example, in the input, if a cell is part of a certain shape, it's replaced by a certain value.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the test input and what the output should look like. The test input has 7s in certain positions, and the output must be 10x11. But without the output, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each non-zero number in the input, it's replaced by a cross shape that is centered at that position, and the cross has a certain width. For example, in example 1, the 8s are replaced by a cross that is centered at the original position.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of a possible code structure. For each cell in the input grid, if it's non-zero, then in the output, we replace it with a cross that extends in certain directions. For example, for a cell at (i,j), we set the output cell (i,j) to the same value, and also set cells in the same row and column to the same value, but only up to a certain distance.\n\nBut this might not fit the examples. For example, in example 1, the third row has 8s in columns 2-6. If we replace each 8 with a cross centered at that position, then the output would have more 8s than the input. But in the output, the third row has three 8s, which is less than the input's five 8s.\n\nHmm, this is confusing.\n\nAnother idea: The transformation is that the non-zero numbers are being replaced by a certain shape that is determined by their position. For example, if a cell is part of a vertical line in the input, then in the output, it's part of a horizontal line. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a cross shape that is centered in the middle of the grid. For example, the input has a certain pattern, and the output has a cross in the middle.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are being transformed into a cross shape that is centered at the same row and column as the original number, but with a certain size. For example, for a cell (i,j) with value v, the output has v in (i,j), and also in (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), etc., up to a certain distance.\n\nBut how to determine the distance?\n\nAlternatively, the cross is formed by the same number, but only in certain directions. For example, in example 1, the 8s are replaced by a cross that is centered at the original position. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure of the exact pattern. But given the examples, I need to find a transformation that can explain them.\n\nLooking at the examples again, perhaps the transformation is that the non-zero numbers are being moved to the left, and the rest are zero. For example, in example 1, the third row's 8s are moved to the left to the first three columns. In example 2, the 6s are moved to the left to the first three columns. In example 3, the 3s are moved to the left to the first three columns. In example 4, the 2s are moved to the left to the first three columns. This seems to be a pattern.\n\nWait, example 3's input has 3s in the fourth row, columns 6-8. The output has 3s in columns 3-5. So they are moved to the left by three positions. Similarly, example 4's input has 2s in the fourth row, columns 4-8. The output has 2s in columns 0-3. So they are moved to the left by four positions. This is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of columns moved is determined by the number of non-zero numbers in the row. For example, in example 1's third row, there are five 8s, and they are moved to three columns. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s, 6s, 3s, and 2s are being moved to the left by a certain number of positions based on their value. For example, 8 is moved left by 2, 6 by 3, 3 by 3, 2 by 4. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, the number of columns moved is determined by the position of the row. For example, in example 1, the third row has 8s moved to the left by two columns. The fourth row has 8s moved to the left by one column.\n\nBut this is not consistent.\n\nAnother observation: The output for example 1's third row has three 8s. The input's third row has five 8s. So the 8s are being reduced in number. But how?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each non-zero number, it's replaced by a certain number of 8s in the output, but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that the non-zero numbers are being replaced by a certain pattern that depends on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the third row, then it's replaced by a certain pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples. The most consistent pattern I see is that non-zero numbers are being moved to the left, possibly in a way that they are spread out in the first few columns.\n\nSo, for each row, the non-zero numbers are moved to the left, and the rest are zero. For example, in example 1's third row, the 8s are moved to the first three columns. In example 2's fourth row, the 6s are moved to the first three columns. In example 3's fourth row, the 3s are moved to the first three columns. In example 4's fourth row, the 2s are moved to the first three columns. This seems to be a pattern.\n\nSo, the transformation could be: for each row, collect all the non-zero numbers, and then replace them with the same numbers in the leftmost positions, and zeros elsewhere. But this would mean that in example 1's third row, the 8s are moved to the left, but the number of 8s is reduced. But in the input, there are five 8s, and in the output, there are three. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero numbers are being moved to the left, but only up to a certain number of columns. For example, in example 1's third row, the 8s are moved to the first three columns, and the rest are zero. So, for each row, the non-zero numbers are moved to the left, and the number of non-zero numbers is the same as in the input. But in the example 1's third row, the input has five 8s, but the output has three. So this is not possible.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the pattern is that the non-zero numbers are being replaced by a certain number of 8s in the first few columns, based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero numbers are being replaced by a certain number of 8s in the first few columns, but this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of a code that can handle the examples. For example, in example 1, the third row's 8s are moved to the first three columns. The fourth row's 8 is moved to the fourth column. The fifth row's 8s are in the first and fifth columns. This seems like the 8s are being spread out in a way that they form a cross.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAnother idea: For each row, the non-zero numbers are being replaced by a certain pattern that depends on their position. For example, if a row has non-zero numbers in certain columns, then in the output, those numbers are moved to the left, and the rest are zero.\n\nBut how to determine how many columns to move them to the left?\n\nMaybe the number of columns to move is determined by the row's position. For example, in example 1, the third row (row index 2) has the 8s moved to the first three columns. The fourth row (row index 3) has the 8 moved to column 3. The fifth row (row index 4) has the 8s moved to column 0 and 4. This doesn't seem to follow a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of columns to move is determined by the number of non-zero numbers in the row. For example, in example 1's third row, there are five 8s. The output has three 8s. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. The most consistent pattern I see is that non-zero numbers are being moved to the left, and the output has them in the first few columns. So for each row, the non-zero numbers are moved to the left, and the rest are zero. But how?\n\nMaybe the code is as follows: for each row, collect all the non-zero values, then in the output row, set the first k columns to those values, and the rest to zero, where k is the number of non-zero values. But this would not fit example 1, where the third row has five 8s, but the output has three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of columns to move is determined by the number of non-zero values in the row. For example, in example 1's third row, there are five 8s, but the output has three. So this is not matching.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the non-zero numbers are being replaced by a certain pattern that forms a cross. For example, in the input, the 8s are in a vertical line, and in the output, they are replaced by a cross that has arms in all directions. But how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, the code could be that for each cell (i,j) in the input, if it's non-zero, then in the output, the cell (i,j) is set to the same value, and also the cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) are set to the same value. This would create a cross shape. But how does this fit the examples?\n\nLet's test this idea with example 1. In the input's third row, the 8s are in columns 2-6. So for each of these cells, the code would set the cell and its neighbors. But this would create a cross shape that extends in all directions. However, the output in example 1 has 8s in the first three columns of the third row. This doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be that for each non-zero cell, it's replaced by a cross that extends in certain directions. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, then the cross extends to the left and right, up and down.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is just guessing.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each row, move the non-zero numbers to the left, and set the rest to zero. This would mean that for each row, the non-zero numbers are moved to the left, and the rest are zero. This would explain examples 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nFor example, in example 1's third row, the input has 8s in columns 2-6. The output has 8s in columns 0-2. So the non-zero numbers are moved to the left, and the rest are zero. This would mean that for each row, the non-zero numbers are moved to the left, and the rest are zero.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe code would be: for each row in the input, create a new row where the non-zero values are moved to the left, and the rest are zero. For example, for a row like [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], the new row would be [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. But how to determine how many non-zero values to move?\n\nWait, in example 1's third row, the input has five 8s, but the output has three. So this approach would not work. But perhaps the number of non-zero values is reduced. This suggests that the pattern is not simply moving non-zero values to the left.\n\nAnother idea: The number of non-zero values in the output is the same as in the input. But in example 1's third row, the input has five 8s, and the output has three. So this is not possible.\n\nAt this point, I think the correct approach is to look for a pattern where the non-zero values are being replaced by a certain shape, like a cross, and the code would replace each non-zero value with a cross centered at that position. For example, for each cell (i,j) with value v, set the output cell (i,j) to v, and also set cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) to v. This would create a cross shape.\n\nLet's test this with example 1. In the input's third row, the 8s are in columns 2-6. So for each of these cells, the code would set the cell and its neighbors. But this would create a cross shape that extends in all directions. However, the output for example 1's third row has 8s in the first three columns, which doesn't match this pattern.\n\nBut perhaps the cross is only in certain directions. For example, only left and right. Or only up and down.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be that for each non-zero cell, it's replaced by a cross that extends to the left and right, but only up to a certain distance.\n\nBut without more information, this is just guessing.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell in the input, if it's non-zero, set the output cell to the same value, and also set the cell to the left and right to the same value. This would create a horizontal line. But this might not fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be that for each non-zero cell, it's replaced by a cross that extends in all directions. But how to implement this.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by replacing each non-zero cell with a cross that is centered at that cell. For example, for a cell (i,j) with value v, the output cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i,j) are set to v. This would create a cross shape.\n\nLet's see for example 1's third row. The input has 8s in columns 2-6. So for each of these cells, the code would set the cross. This would create a cross in each of these positions. But the output for example 1's third row has 8s in the first three columns. This doesn't match.\n\nBut perhaps the code is different. Maybe the cross is only in certain directions. For example, only left and right.\n\nAlternatively, the code is to replace each non-zero cell with a cross that extends in the left and right directions, but only up to a certain number of columns.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to write code that for each row, moves the non-zero values to the left, and sets the rest to zero. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's better than nothing.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n    new_row = [0] * 11\n    count = 0\n    for j in range(11):\n        if grid[row][j] != 0:\n            new_row[count] = grid[row][j]\n            count += 1\n    return new_row\n\nBut this would move all non-zero values to the left, and the rest to zero. But this would not fit example 1's third row, where the input has five 8s, but the output has three. So this is not correct.\n\nBut maybe the examples have other patterns. For example, in example 1, the output for the third row has three 8s, which is the number of columns in the output. So perhaps the code is to replace the non-zero values with the same number of 8s in the first few columns, but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be that for each row, the non-zero values are replaced by a certain number of 8s in the first few columns, based on the number of non-zero values in the row.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is just guessing.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following code: for each row, replace the non-zero values with the same values in the leftmost positions, and the rest are zero. This would mean that the code is to move the non-zero values to the left, and the rest are zero. This might not fit all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = [0] * 11\n        count = 0\n        for val in row:\n            if val != 0:\n                new_row[count] = val\n                count += 1\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit example 1's third row, where the input has five 8s, but the output has three. So this code would not work. But perhaps the examples have other patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is to replace the non-zero values with a certain number of 8s in the first few columns, based on the position of the row.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output has 11 columns, which is one less than the input's columns in some examples. For example, example 1's input has 11 columns, and the output also has 11. Example 3's input has 13 columns, and the output has 11. So the code must reduce the number of columns from the input's columns to 11. This suggests that the code is removing certain columns.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to remove?\n\nFor example, in example 1, the input has 11 columns, and the output has 11. So no columns are removed. In example 3, the input has 13 columns, and the output has 11. So two columns are removed. Maybe the code is removing columns from the right or left.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to remove?\n\nAlternatively, the code is to keep the first 11 columns of the input, but this would not explain the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the code is to remove columns from the input based on certain patterns. For example, in example 3, the input has 13 columns, and the output has 11. So two columns are removed. Maybe the code is to remove the last two columns.\n\nBut this would not explain the other examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the code that moves non-zero values to the left, and the rest to zero, even if it doesn't fit all examples. This is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a 10x11 grid. The output is also 10x11. The input has some 8s in the third row, and in the middle rows, there are 8s forming a sort of vertical line. The output seems to have those 8s moved to the left, but not sure. Wait, in the input, the third row is 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 8s are shifted to the left. But then in the fourth row of input, there's 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 8s are moved to the left? Wait, the original input's fourth row has 8s at positions 2 and 6 (assuming 0-based index). The output's fourth row has 8 at position 3. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, maybe the 8s are being expanded or spread out in some way.\n\nWait, maybe the 8s are being transformed into a certain shape. Let me think about the output of example 1. The third row in the output has 8s in the first three positions, then zeros. The fourth row has an 8 in the fourth position. The fifth row has an 8 in the second position. The sixth row has an 8 in the third position. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where the 8s are being spread out in a certain way. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are being moved to the left, but not sure.\n\nLooking at example 2: The input has 6s in the fourth row. The output for that row has 6s in the first three positions. Then in the fifth row of input, there's 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 6s are moving to the left? Like, in the fifth row of input, the 6s are at positions 4 and 6. In the output, they are at positions 1 and 3. Hmm, maybe the 6s are being spread out in a way that they are placed in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 6s are being transformed into a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are in a vertical line in the third row, and in the output, they are spread out to the left. But then in the fourth row, there's an 8 in the middle, but in the output, it's moved left. Maybe the pattern is that the 8s are being replaced by a certain shape, like a cross or something else.\n\nLooking at example 3: The input has a 3 in the fourth row, and the output has a 3 in the fourth row but shifted. The input has 3s in positions 6,7,8 (assuming 0-based), and the output has them in positions 3,4,5. So maybe the 3s are being moved to the left. But the input is 13 columns (since the first example is 11 columns, but example 3 has 13 columns? Wait, the first example is 10 rows, 11 columns. The third example's input is 10 rows, 13 columns? Wait, the input for example 3 is given as 13 columns. So maybe the pattern is that certain numbers are being moved to the left, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in a vertical line in the input, and in the output, they are spread out in a way that they form a horizontal line. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 4: The input has 2s in the fourth row, and the output has them shifted left. The input's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2s are moved to the left. Then in the fifth row of input, the 2s are in positions 4 and 8 (assuming 0-based), but the output has them in positions 0 and 1. Wait, no, the input fifth row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. The output is 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2s are moved to the left. So maybe the pattern is that for certain numbers, they are being moved to the left, but how?\n\nAnother observation: In example 1, the input has 8s in the third row, and the output has them in the first three columns. The fourth row of input has 8s in positions 2 and 6 (0-based?), but in the output, the 8 is in position 3. Wait, maybe the 8s are being spread out in a way that they are placed in certain positions. But this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 8s, 6s, 3s, and 2s are being transformed into a certain shape, such as a cross or a line. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are in a vertical line. The output has them spread out in a horizontal line. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being replaced by a certain pattern based on their positions. For example, the numbers in the input are being replaced by a certain shape, such as a cross, where the 8s in the input are transformed into a cross shape. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed based on their positions. For example, in the input, certain positions have numbers, and in the output, those numbers are moved to the left. For example, in example 1, the third row has 8s in positions 2-6 (columns 2 to 6?), and the output has them in columns 0-2. Then in the fourth row of input, the 8s are in columns 2 and 6, but in the output, they are moved to column 3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed based on their positions in the grid. For example, the numbers in the input are being replaced by a certain pattern that depends on their position. For example, if a cell has a number, then in the output, it's replaced by a certain value based on some rule.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of example 1. The output has the 8s in the third row as the first three columns. The fourth row of output has an 8 in the fourth column. The fifth row has an 8 in the second column. The sixth row has an 8 in the third column. The seventh row has 8s in columns 3-7. Wait, this seems like a pattern where the 8s are being spread out in a way that they form a certain shape. For example, the third row has 8s in the first three columns, then the fourth row has an 8 in the fourth column. The fifth row has an 8 in the second column, and so on. Maybe this is a pattern where the 8s are being spread out in a way that they form a certain shape, like a cross or a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed based on their position in the grid. For example, in the input, certain numbers are present in certain positions, and in the output, they are moved to the left. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are moved to the left. Similarly, in example 2, the 6s are moved to the left. In example 3, the 3s are moved to the left. In example 4, the 2s are moved to the left.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for each number in the input, it's being moved to the left as much as possible, but only in certain positions. But how?\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the numbers are being transformed into a certain shape. For example, in example 1, the 8s form a vertical line in the input, and in the output, they are spread out to form a horizontal line. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being replaced by a certain pattern based on their position. For example, if a cell is part of a certain shape, then it's replaced by a certain value. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in a vertical line, and in the output, they are spread out to form a horizontal line. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a cross shape. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are in a vertical line, and in the output, they are spread out to form a cross. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being transformed based on their position in the grid. For example, the 8s in the input are in certain rows and columns, and in the output, they are moved to the left. For example, in example 1, the third row has 8s in columns 2-6, and in the output, they are moved to columns 0-2. Then the fourth row has 8s in columns 2 and 6, and in the output, they are moved to column 3. But how?\n\nAnother observation: In example 1, the output for the third row is 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So three 8s in the first three columns. The fourth row in the output is 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So an 8 in column 3. The fifth row is 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, no. Wait the fifth row of the output is 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0? Or is that the sixth row? Let me check example 1 again.\n\nExample 1's output:\n\nRow 3: 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\nSo, for row 5, the output has 8 in column 0 and 4. Hmm, that's not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by a certain shape. For example, the 8s in the input are part of a vertical line, and in the output, they are transformed into a horizontal line. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of example 1. The third row in the output has three 8s. The fourth row has one 8. The fifth row has two 8s. The sixth row has two 8s. The seventh row has five 8s. This seems like a pattern where the 8s are being spread out in a way that forms a certain shape. Maybe the 8s are being spread out to form a cross shape. For example, the third row has three 8s, which could be part of a cross. Then the fourth row has one 8 in the middle. The fifth row has two 8s. Maybe this is a cross shape that expands outward.\n\nBut how to translate this into a transformation rule?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the input are being replaced by a certain pattern based on their positions. For example, if a cell is part of a certain shape, then it's replaced by a certain value. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother idea: The examples seem to have a pattern where certain numbers are being transformed into a cross shape. For example, in example 1, the 8s form a cross. In example 2, the 6s form a cross. In example 3, the 3s form a cross. In example 4, the 2s form a cross. So the transformation is that the numbers in the input are replaced by a cross shape, where the cross is centered in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine where the cross is?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a cross shape that is centered in the middle of the grid. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are in the third row, and in the output, they are spread out to form a cross. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the input are being replaced by a cross shape that is centered in the middle of the grid. For example, the input has a certain pattern, and the output has a cross shape that is formed by the numbers.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the left. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are moved to the left. For example, in the third row of input, the 8s are in columns 2-6. In the output, they are in columns 0-2. So they are moved left by two positions. Similarly, in the fourth row of input, the 8s are in columns 2 and 6. In the output, they are in column 3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a certain shape based on their position. For example, if a cell is part of a vertical line in the input, then in the output, it's part of a cross.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 3: 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 \u2192 Output row 3: 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 8s are moved to the left, but only the first three columns. So the 8s are spread out to the left. Similarly, in the fourth row of input, the 8s are in columns 2 and 6. The output has an 8 in column 3. So maybe the 8s are being moved to the left, but only in certain positions.\n\nAnother observation: In example 1, the output's seventh row has 8s in columns 3-7. The input's seventh row has 8s in columns 2-6. So they are moved to the left by one position. But this is not consistent with other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a certain shape based on their position. For example, the numbers are being replaced by a cross shape that is centered in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAnother idea: For each number in the input, if it's not zero, it's replaced by a cross shape centered at a certain position. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are in a vertical line, and in the output, they form a cross. But how to determine the center?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a cross shape that is centered in the middle of the grid. For example, the cross is formed by 8s in a certain pattern.\n\nBut how to determine the center for each input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by a cross shape that is centered at the same position as the original number. For example, if the input has an 8 in a certain position, then in the output, it's replaced by a cross that is centered there.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nLet me think about the test input. The test input has a 10x13 grid. The input has 7s in certain positions. The output should be 10x11. Wait, no, the test input is given, but the output is not provided. But the problem says that the output must be 10x11. So the test input is 10 rows, 13 columns. The output is 10x11. So the transformation must reduce the number of columns from 13 to 11. But how?\n\nWait, the training examples have varying numbers of columns. For example, example 1 has 11 columns, example 2 has 11 columns, example 3 has 13 columns, example 4 has 13 columns. The test input has 13 columns. So the output must be 10x11 for all examples. So the transformation must reduce the number of columns from the input's columns to 11. But how?\n\nThis suggests that the transformation involves some kind of column reduction. For example, in example 3, the input has 13 columns, and the output has 11. So maybe the columns are being reduced by removing certain columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some pattern that depends on the input's structure. For example, the input has certain numbers in certain positions, and the output has those numbers in certain positions, possibly with some columns removed.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to think of a possible transformation rule that can explain the examples.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by replacing each non-zero number in the input with a certain pattern. For example, the number 8 in the input is replaced by a cross shape in the output. The cross shape is centered at the same position as the original number, but with a certain width.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers in the input are being replaced by a cross shape that extends in certain directions. For example, the number 8 is replaced by a cross that has arms in all directions.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a cross shape that is centered at the same row and column as the original number. For example, if there is an 8 in position (i,j), then in the output, there is a cross centered at (i,j), but only in certain directions.\n\nBut how to determine the size of the cross?\n\nAlternatively, the cross is formed by the same number, but with certain positions filled. For example, in example 1, the third row has 8s in columns 2-6. In the output, they are spread out to the left, forming a cross. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a cross shape that is centered at the same row and column as the original number. For example, if there is an 8 in position (i,j), then in the output, there is a cross centered at (i,j), with arms extending in certain directions. But how to determine the size of the cross?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the examples again. In example 1, the input has 8s in certain rows. The output has 8s in certain positions. For example, in the third row of input, the 8s are in columns 2-6. In the output, they are in columns 0-2. So they are moved left by two positions. In the fourth row of input, the 8s are in columns 2 and 6. In the output, the 8 is in column 3. So maybe the 8s are being moved to the left by a certain amount. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the left by a certain number of columns. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the third row are moved left by 2 columns. In the fourth row, the 8s are moved left by 1 column. This seems inconsistent, but perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the left based on their position in the grid. For example, if the number is in row i, then it's moved left by some function of i.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: The output for each row is formed by taking the input row and replacing the non-zero numbers with a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the third row of input has 8s in columns 2-6. In the output, those 8s are moved to the left, and the rest are zero. So maybe the non-zero numbers are being moved to the left as much as possible, but only in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero numbers are being moved to the left, but only up to a certain point. For example, in example 1, the third row's 8s are moved to the left to the first three columns. So the 8s are spread out to the left, but not overlapping with other 8s.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero numbers are moved to the left, but only up to a certain number of columns. For example, in example 1, the third row has 8s in columns 2-6, which are moved to the left to columns 0-2. But how to determine how many columns to move them?\n\nAlternatively, the number of columns to move is determined by the number of non-zero numbers in the row. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: In example 1, the output's third row has three 8s. The input's third row has five 8s. So the 8s are being reduced in number. But this seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by a certain pattern based on their positions. For example, in the input, if a cell is part of a certain shape, it's replaced by a certain value.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the test input and what the output should look like. The test input has 7s in certain positions, and the output must be 10x11. But without the output, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each non-zero number in the input, it's replaced by a cross shape that is centered at that position, and the cross has a certain width. For example, in example 1, the 8s are replaced by a cross that is centered at the original position.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of a possible code structure. For each cell in the input grid, if it's non-zero, then in the output, we replace it with a cross that extends in certain directions. For example, for a cell at (i,j), we set the output cell (i,j) to the same value, and also set cells in the same row and column to the same value, but only up to a certain distance.\n\nBut this might not fit the examples. For example, in example 1, the third row has 8s in columns 2-6. If we replace each 8 with a cross centered at that position, then the output would have more 8s than the input. But in the output, the third row has three 8s, which is less than the input's five 8s.\n\nHmm, this is confusing.\n\nAnother idea: The transformation is that the non-zero numbers are being replaced by a certain shape that is determined by their position. For example, if a cell is part of a vertical line in the input, then in the output, it's part of a horizontal line. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a cross shape that is centered in the middle of the grid. For example, the input has a certain pattern, and the output has a cross in the middle.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers are being transformed into a cross shape that is centered at the same row and column as the original number, but with a certain size. For example, for a cell (i,j) with value v, the output has v in (i,j), and also in (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), etc., up to a certain distance.\n\nBut how to determine the distance?\n\nAlternatively, the cross is formed by the same number, but only in certain directions. For example, in example 1, the 8s are replaced by a cross that is centered at the original position. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure of the exact pattern. But given the examples, I need to find a transformation that can explain them.\n\nLooking at the examples again, perhaps the transformation is that the non-zero numbers are being moved to the left, and the rest are zero. For example, in example 1, the third row's 8s are moved to the left to the first three columns. In example 2, the 6s are moved to the left to the first three columns. In example 3, the 3s are moved to the left to the first three columns. In example 4, the 2s are moved to the left to the first three columns. This seems to be a pattern.\n\nWait, example 3's input has 3s in the fourth row, columns 6-8. The output has 3s in columns 3-5. So they are moved to the left by three positions. Similarly, example 4's input has 2s in the fourth row, columns 4-8. The output has 2s in columns 0-3. So they are moved to the left by four positions. This is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of columns moved is determined by the number of non-zero numbers in the row. For example, in example 1's third row, there are five 8s, and they are moved to three columns. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s, 6s, 3s, and 2s are being moved to the left by a certain number of positions based on their value. For example, 8 is moved left by 2, 6 by 3, 3 by 3, 2 by 4. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, the number of columns moved is determined by the position of the row. For example, in example 1, the third row has 8s moved to the left by two columns. The fourth row has 8s moved to the left by one column.\n\nBut this is not consistent.\n\nAnother observation: The output for example 1's third row has three 8s. The input's third row has five 8s. So the 8s are being reduced in number. But how?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each non-zero number, it's replaced by a certain number of 8s in the output, but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that the non-zero numbers are being replaced by a certain pattern that depends on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the third row, then it's replaced by a certain pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples. The most consistent pattern I see is that non-zero numbers are being moved to the left, possibly in a way that they are spread out in the first few columns.\n\nSo, for each row, the non-zero numbers are moved to the left, and the rest are zero. For example, in example 1's third row, the 8s are moved to the first three columns. In example 2's fourth row, the 6s are moved to the first three columns. In example 3's fourth row, the 3s are moved to the first three columns. In example 4's fourth row, the 2s are moved to the first three columns. This seems to be a pattern.\n\nSo, the transformation could be: for each row, collect all the non-zero numbers, and then replace them with the same numbers in the leftmost positions, and zeros elsewhere. But this would mean that in example 1's third row, the 8s are moved to the left, but the number of 8s is reduced. But in the input, there are five 8s, and in the output, there are three. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero numbers are being moved to the left, but only up to a certain number of columns. For example, in example 1's third row, the 8s are moved to the first three columns, and the rest are zero. So, for each row, the non-zero numbers are moved to the left, and the number of non-zero numbers is the same as in the input. But in the example 1's third row, the input has five 8s, but the output has three. So this is not possible.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the pattern is that the non-zero numbers are being replaced by a certain number of 8s in the first few columns, based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero numbers are being replaced by a certain number of 8s in the first few columns, but this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of a code that can handle the examples. For example, in example 1, the third row's 8s are moved to the first three columns. The fourth row's 8 is moved to the fourth column. The fifth row's 8s are in the first and fifth columns. This seems like the 8s are being spread out in a way that they form a cross.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAnother idea: For each row, the non-zero numbers are being replaced by a certain pattern that depends on their position. For example, if a row has non-zero numbers in certain columns, then in the output, those numbers are moved to the left, and the rest are zero.\n\nBut how to determine how many columns to move them to the left?\n\nMaybe the number of columns to move is determined by the row's position. For example, in example 1, the third row (row index 2) has the 8s moved to the first three columns. The fourth row (row index 3) has the 8 moved to column 3. The fifth row (row index 4) has the 8s moved to column 0 and 4. This doesn't seem to follow a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of columns to move is determined by the number of non-zero numbers in the row. For example, in example 1's third row, there are five 8s. The output has three 8s. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. The most consistent pattern I see is that non-zero numbers are being moved to the left, and the output has them in the first few columns. So for each row, the non-zero numbers are moved to the left, and the rest are zero. But how?\n\nMaybe the code is as follows: for each row, collect all the non-zero values, then in the output row, set the first k columns to those values, and the rest to zero, where k is the number of non-zero values. But this would not fit example 1, where the third row has five 8s, but the output has three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of columns to move is determined by the number of non-zero values in the row. For example, in example 1's third row, there are five 8s, but the output has three. So this is not matching.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the non-zero numbers are being replaced by a certain pattern that forms a cross. For example, in the input, the 8s are in a vertical line, and in the output, they are replaced by a cross that has arms in all directions. But how to code this?\n\nAlternatively, the code could be that for each cell (i,j) in the input, if it's non-zero, then in the output, the cell (i,j) is set to the same value, and also the cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) are set to the same value. This would create a cross shape. But how does this fit the examples?\n\nLet's test this idea with example 1. In the input's third row, the 8s are in columns 2-6. So for each of these cells, the code would set the cell and its neighbors. But this would create a cross shape that extends in all directions. However, the output in example 1 has 8s in the first three columns of the third row. This doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be that for each non-zero cell, it's replaced by a cross that extends in certain directions. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, then the cross extends to the left and right, up and down.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is just guessing.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each row, move the non-zero numbers to the left, and set the rest to zero. This would mean that for each row, the non-zero numbers are moved to the left, and the rest are zero. This would explain examples 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nFor example, in example 1's third row, the input has 8s in columns 2-6. The output has 8s in columns 0-2. So the non-zero numbers are moved to the left, and the rest are zero. This would mean that for each row, the non-zero numbers are moved to the left, and the rest are zero.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe code would be: for each row in the input, create a new row where the non-zero values are moved to the left, and the rest are zero. For example, for a row like [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], the new row would be [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. But how to determine how many non-zero values to move?\n\nWait, in example 1's third row, the input has five 8s, but the output has three. So this approach would not work. But perhaps the number of non-zero values is reduced. This suggests that the pattern is not simply moving non-zero values to the left.\n\nAnother idea: The number of non-zero values in the output is the same as in the input. But in example 1's third row, the input has five 8s, and the output has three. So this is not possible.\n\nAt this point, I think the correct approach is to look for a pattern where the non-zero values are being replaced by a certain shape, like a cross, and the code would replace each non-zero value with a cross centered at that position. For example, for each cell (i,j) with value v, set the output cell (i,j) to v, and also set cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) to v. This would create a cross shape.\n\nLet's test this with example 1. In the input's third row, the 8s are in columns 2-6. So for each of these cells, the code would set the cell and its neighbors. But this would create a cross shape that extends in all directions. However, the output for example 1's third row has 8s in the first three columns, which doesn't match this pattern.\n\nBut perhaps the cross is only in certain directions. For example, only left and right. Or only up and down.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be that for each non-zero cell, it's replaced by a cross that extends to the left and right, but only up to a certain distance.\n\nBut without more information, this is just guessing.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell in the input, if it's non-zero, set the output cell to the same value, and also set the cell to the left and right to the same value. This would create a horizontal line. But this might not fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be that for each non-zero cell, it's replaced by a cross that extends in all directions. But how to implement this.\n\nAnother idea: The output is formed by replacing each non-zero cell with a cross that is centered at that cell. For example, for a cell (i,j) with value v, the output cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i,j) are set to v. This would create a cross shape.\n\nLet's see for example 1's third row. The input has 8s in columns 2-6. So for each of these cells, the code would set the cross. This would create a cross in each of these positions. But the output for example 1's third row has 8s in the first three columns. This doesn't match.\n\nBut perhaps the code is different. Maybe the cross is only in certain directions. For example, only left and right.\n\nAlternatively, the code is to replace each non-zero cell with a cross that extends in the left and right directions, but only up to a certain number of columns.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to write code that for each row, moves the non-zero values to the left, and sets the rest to zero. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's better than nothing.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n    new_row = [0] * 11\n    count = 0\n    for j in range(11):\n        if grid[row][j] != 0:\n            new_row[count] = grid[row][j]\n            count += 1\n    return new_row\n\nBut this would move all non-zero values to the left, and the rest to zero. But this would not fit example 1's third row, where the input has five 8s, but the output has three. So this is not correct.\n\nBut maybe the examples have other patterns. For example, in example 1, the output for the third row has three 8s, which is the number of columns in the output. So perhaps the code is to replace the non-zero values with the same number of 8s in the first few columns, but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be that for each row, the non-zero values are replaced by a certain number of 8s in the first few columns, based on the number of non-zero values in the row.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is just guessing.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following code: for each row, replace the non-zero values with the same values in the leftmost positions, and the rest are zero. This would mean that the code is to move the non-zero values to the left, and the rest are zero. This might not fit all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = [0] * 11\n        count = 0\n        for val in row:\n            if val != 0:\n                new_row[count] = val\n                count += 1\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit example 1's third row, where the input has five 8s, but the output has three. So this code would not work. But perhaps the examples have other patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is to replace the non-zero values with a certain number of 8s in the first few columns, based on the position of the row.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output has 11 columns, which is one less than the input's columns in some examples. For example, example 1's input has 11 columns, and the output also has 11. Example 3's input has 13 columns, and the output has 11. So the code must reduce the number of columns from the input's columns to 11. This suggests that the code is removing certain columns.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to remove?\n\nFor example, in example 1, the input has 11 columns, and the output has 11. So no columns are removed. In example 3, the input has 13 columns, and the output has 11. So two columns are removed. Maybe the code is removing columns from the right or left.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to remove?\n\nAlternatively, the code is to keep the first 11 columns of the input, but this would not explain the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the code is to remove columns from the input based on certain patterns. For example, in example 3, the input has 13 columns, and the output has 11. So two columns are removed. Maybe the code is to remove the last two columns.\n\nBut this would not explain the other examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the code that moves non-zero values to the left, and the rest to zero, even if it doesn't fit all examples. This is the best I can do.\n"
