The transformation seems to be creating a more complex pattern around the central \"3\" block\n4. The transformation appears to be creating a sort of \"spread\" or \"expansion\" pattern around the central block\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Leaves the outermost rows and columns unchanged\n- Creates a pattern around the central \"3\" block\n- Replaces \"3\" values with \"4\", \"2\", and \"3\" in a specific pattern\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the size of the grid\n    size = 15\n    \n    # Identify the central block of 3s\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Create a pattern around the central block\n                # This is a simple pattern that creates a more complex shape\n                # around the central block of 3s\n                for dx in range(-2, 3):\n                    for dy in range(-2, 3):\n                        if abs(dx) + abs(dy) <= 3:\n                            ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                            if 0 <= ni < size and 0 <= nj < size:\n                                if grid[ni][nj] == 3:\n                                    transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 4\n                                elif grid[ni][nj] == 0:\n                                    transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 2\n                                # Keep 3s as they are\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the size of the grid\n    size = 15\n    \n    # Identify the central block of 3s\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Create a pattern around the central block\n                # This is a simple pattern that creates a more complex shape\n                # around the central block of 3s\n                for dx in range(-2, 3):\n                    for dy in range(-2, 3):\n                        if abs(dx) + abs(dy) <= 3:\n                            ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                            if 0 <= ni < size and 0 <= nj < size:\n                                if grid[ni][nj] == 3:\n                                    transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 4\n                                elif grid[ni][nj] == 0:\n                                    transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 2\n                                # Keep 3s as they are\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
