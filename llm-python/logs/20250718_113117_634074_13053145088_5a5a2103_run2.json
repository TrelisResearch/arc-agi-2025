The output grid seems to have a \"spread\" of numbers where certain values are repeated in patterns\n2. There appears to be a transformation where certain values (like 2, 3, 4, etc.) are spread out in a pattern\n3. The output grid seems to have a \"stencil\" effect where certain values are repeated in a pattern\n4. The transformation seems to involve expanding certain values in a pattern\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads certain values in a pattern.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 14x14 output grid initialized with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(14)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(14):\n        for col in range(14):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # If the value is not 0, spread it in a pattern\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread the value in a pattern across the output grid\n                # This is a simple pattern that spreads the value in a diagonal pattern\n                for i in range(14):\n                    for j in range(14):\n                        if abs(i - row) + abs(j - col) <= 2:\n                            transformed_grid[i][j] = value\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid seems to have a \"spread\" of numbers where certain values are repeated in patterns\n2. There appears to be a transformation where certain values (like 2, 3, 4, etc.) are spread out in a pattern\n3. The output grid seems to have a \"stencil\" effect where certain values are repeated in a pattern\n4. The transformation seems to involve expanding certain values in a pattern\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads certain values in a pattern.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 14x14 output grid initialized with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(14)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(14):\n        for col in range(14):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # If the value is not 0, spread it in a pattern\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread the value in a pattern across the output grid\n                # This is a simple pattern that spreads the value in a diagonal pattern\n                for i in range(14):\n                    for j in range(14):\n                        if abs(i - row) + abs(j - col) <= 2:\n                            transformed_grid[i][j] = value\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
