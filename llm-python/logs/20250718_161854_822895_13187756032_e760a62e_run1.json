The transformation often replaces certain values with sequences of numbers (like 2s, 3s, 6s, etc.)\n2. There's a pattern where certain positions in the grid get replaced with sequences of numbers, especially in the middle rows\n3. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with sequences of numbers that increase in value as we move from left to right or top to bottom\n4. There's a pattern where certain rows get replaced with all 8s, and other rows get transformed with sequences of numbers\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces certain values with sequences of numbers\n- Replaces certain rows with all 8s\n- Applies transformations based on position in the grid\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

There's a pattern where certain rows get replaced with all 8s, and other rows get transformed with sequences of numbers\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces certain values with sequences of numbers\n- Replaces certain rows with all 8s\n- Applies transformations based on position in the grid\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation pattern\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            # Replace certain values with sequences of numbers\n            if grid[i][j] == 0 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                # Replace with 2s, 3s, 6s, etc. based on position\n                if i % 4 == 0 and j % 4 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 0 and j % 4 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 0 and j % 4 == 2:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 0 and j % 4 == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 1 and j % 4 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 1 and j % 4 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 1 and j % 4 == 2:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 1 and j % 4 == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 2 and j % 4 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 2 and j % 4 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 2 and j % 4 == 2:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 2 and j % 4 == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 3 and j % 4 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 3 and j % 4 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 3 and j % 4 == 2:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 4 == 3 and j % 4 == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n            #
