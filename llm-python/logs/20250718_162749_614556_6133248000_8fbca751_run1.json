          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that:\n1. Values of 8 in the input often get transformed to 2 or 8 in the output\n2. There seems to be a pattern where 8s are replaced with 2s in certain positions\n3. The transformation appears to be related to the position of 8s in the grid\n4. The output grid always has 8 rows and 12 columns\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing 8s with 2s in certain positions, particularly where 8s are in contiguous blocks or in specific patterns.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(8):\n        for j in range(12):\n            # Check if the cell is 8 and if it's part of a pattern that should be transformed\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Check if the cell is in a position that should be transformed to 2\n                # This is a simplified pattern based on observations from the examples\n                if (i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0) or (i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(8):\n        for j in range(12):\n            # Check if the cell is 8 and if it's part of a pattern that should be transformed\n            # This is a simplified pattern based on observations from the examples\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Check if the cell is in a position that should be transformed to 2\n                # This is a simplified pattern based on observations from the examples\n                if (i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0) or (i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

Values of 8 in the input often get transformed to 2 or 8 in the output\n2. There seems to be a pattern where 8s are replaced with 2s in certain positions\n3. The transformation appears to be related to the position of 8s in the grid\n4. The output grid always has 8 rows and 12 columns\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing 8s with 2s in certain positions, particularly where 8s are in contiguous blocks or in specific patterns.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(8):\n        for j in range(12):\n            # Check if the cell is 8 and if it's part of a pattern that should be transformed\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Check if the cell is in a position that should be transformed to 2\n                # This is a simplified pattern based on observations from the examples\n                if (i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0) or (i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(8):\n        for j in range(12):\n            # Check if the cell is 8 and if it's part of a pattern that should be transformed\n            # This is a simplified pattern based on observations from the examples\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Check if the cell is in a position that should be transformed to 2\n                # This is a simplified pattern based on observations from the examples\n                if (i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0) or (i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
