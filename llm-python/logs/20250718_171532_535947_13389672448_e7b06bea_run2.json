          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation seems to involve moving certain values in specific patterns. For example, in Example 1, the value 5 stays in the top-left corner, and the value 1 moves to specific positions. In Example 2, values 9 and 8 seem to be moved to specific positions in the grid.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves moving certain values in a pattern that depends on their position in the grid. Specifically, it seems like values in the first column might be moved to specific positions in the grid.\n\nHere's my best hypothesis for the transformation:\n\n1. Values in the first column are moved to specific positions in the grid.\n2. The transformation seems to involve a pattern where certain values are moved to specific positions based on their original position.\n\nBased on this, I'll write a Python function that implements this pattern.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each row, move the first value to a specific position\n    for i in range(5):\n        # Move the first value to the 4th position in the row\n        transformed_grid[i][3] = transformed_grid[i][0]\n        # Move the 5th value to the 1st position in the row\n        transformed_grid[i][0] = transformed_grid[i][4]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The value \"5\" in the input grid is moved to a specific position in the output grid\n2. Other values are moved in a pattern that seems to be based on their original position relative to the \"5\"\n3. The transformation involves some kind of rotation or shifting of values based on their position\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that moves the value \"5\" to a specific position and shifts other values based on their position relative to the \"5\".\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the position of the value 5 in the input grid\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Move the 5 to a specific position in the output grid\n                # For example, move it to the top-left corner\n                new_i, new_j = 0, 0\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    \n    # Create a new 5x5 grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)]\n    \n    # Copy the value 5 to its new position\n    transformed_grid[new_i][new_j] = 5\n    \n    # Copy other values based on their position relative to the 5\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if grid[i][j] != 5:\n                # Calculate the new position based on the original position\n                # This is a simple example of how values might be shifted\n                # You would need to adjust this based on actual patterns observed\n                new_i = (i + new_i) % 5\n                new_j = (j + new_j) % 5\n                transformed_grid[new_i][new_j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the position of the value 5 in the input grid\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Move the 5 to a specific position in the output grid\n                # For example, move it to the top-left corner\n                new_i, new_j = 0, 0\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    \n    # Create a new 5x5 grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)]\n    \n    # Copy the value 5 to its new position\n    transformed_grid[new_i][new_j] = 5\n    \n    # Copy other values based on their position relative to the 5\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if grid[i][j] != 5:\n                # Calculate the new position based on the original position\n                # This is a simple example of how values might be shifted\n                # You would need to adjust this based on actual patterns observed\n                new_i = (i + new_i) % 5\n                new_j = (j + new_j) % 5\n                transformed_grid[new_i][new_j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation seems to involve moving certain values in specific patterns. For example, in Example 1, the value 5 stays in the top-left corner, and the value 1 moves to specific positions. In Example 2, values 9 and 8 seem to be moved to specific positions in the grid.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves moving certain values in a pattern that depends on their position in the grid. Specifically, it seems like values in the first column might be moved to specific positions in the grid.\n\nHere's my best hypothesis for the transformation:\n\n1. Values in the first column are moved to specific positions in the grid.\n2. The transformation seems to involve a pattern where certain values are moved to specific positions based on their original position.\n\nBased on this, I'll write a Python function that implements this pattern.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each row, move the first value to a specific position\n    for i in range(5):\n        # Move the first value to the 4th position in the row\n        transformed_grid[i][3] = transformed_grid[i][0]\n        # Move the 5th value to the 1st position in the row\n        transformed_grid[i][0] = transformed_grid[i][4]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
