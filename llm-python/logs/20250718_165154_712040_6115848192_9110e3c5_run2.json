          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output grids often have 8s in specific positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the top-right and middle-center positions. In Example 2, the output has 8s in the middle row. In Examples 3-7, the output has 8s in the middle row and top-right position.\n\nI hypothesize that the transformation involves identifying certain patterns in the input grid and replacing specific cells with 8s. Based on the examples, it seems that the middle row and top-right position are often targeted for 8s.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Check if the middle row (row 3) has any non-zero values\n    if grid[3][0] != 0 or grid[3][1] != 0 or grid[3][2] != 0:\n        transformed_grid[1][0] = 8\n        transformed_grid[1][1] = 8\n        transformed_grid[1][2] = 8\n    \n    # Check if the top-right position (row 0, column 2) has any non-zero values\n    if grid[0][2] != 0:\n        transformed_grid[0][2] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Check if the middle row (row 3) has any non-zero values\n    if grid[3][0] != 0 or grid[3][1] != 0 or grid[3][2] != 0:\n        transformed_grid[1][0] = 8\n        transformed_grid[1][1] = 8\n        transformed_grid[1][2] = 8\n    \n    # Check if the top-right position (row 0, column 2) has any non-zero values\n    if grid[0][2] != 0:\n        transformed_grid[0][2] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
