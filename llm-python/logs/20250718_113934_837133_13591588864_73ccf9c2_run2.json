The transformation appears to involve identifying specific patterns in the input and converting them into a simplified 4x4 output grid.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n1. The output grid seems to represent a simplified version of certain patterns in the input\n2. The transformation involves identifying specific shapes or patterns in the input grid\n3.

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output grids seem to represent certain patterns or shapes derived from the input grids. The transformation appears to involve identifying specific patterns in the input and converting them into a simplified 4x4 output grid.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n1. The output grid seems to represent a simplified version of certain patterns in the input\n2. The transformation involves identifying specific shapes or patterns in the input grid\n3. The output grid appears to be a 4x4 representation of certain features from the input\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that looks for certain patterns in the input grid and converts them into a 4x4 output grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
