          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a lot of 0s and 3s, and the output has some 3s and 1s. The output seems to have 1s replacing some 3s in certain positions. Maybe there's a pattern where 3s are replaced with 1s in specific areas. Also, the output has some 1s in the middle rows. Wait, in the input, the 3s are in the middle rows, and the output has 1s in those positions. But in the first example, the input's middle rows (rows 3-6) are all 0s except for the 3s. The output in those rows has 1s in certain positions. Hmm, maybe the 3s are being replaced with 1s in certain regions.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has some 2s and 3s. The output has 3s and 1s. For instance, in the first row of input, there's a 2 in the 10th column. The output's first row has 1s in the 9th and 10th columns. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 1s based on their position relative to some structure.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has 2s and 3s. The output has 2s, 3s, and 1s. For example, in the input's row 6, there's a 3 in the 5th column. The output has a 1 in that position. Also, in the input's row 7, there's a 3 in the 5th column, and the output has a 1 there. So maybe the 3s in certain positions are being replaced with 1s. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 4: The input has 0s, 2s, 3s. The output has 1s and 3s. For example, in the input's row 3, there's a 3 in the 4th column. The output has a 1 there. Also, in the input's row 4, there's a 3 in the 4th column, and the output has a 1. So perhaps there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced with 1s based on their location.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that form a sort of diagonal or cross shape. For example, in the middle rows, the 1s are in positions that form a vertical line. Also, in Example 4, the output has 1s in certain positions that might be part of a cross or a line.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain patterns with 1s. For example, if there's a 3 in a position that's part of a specific shape, it's replaced with 1. Or maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a certain structure, like a cross or a vertical line.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for positions where 1s are introduced. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in the 6th column (index 5?), but that's not clear. Wait, looking at the output of Example 1:\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 the 1 is in column 5 (index 5). Then row 4 has 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 same column. Then row 5 has 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 4,5,6. Then row 6 has 2s and 1s. So maybe the 1s are placed in a vertical line or a cross shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed where there's a certain pattern of 3s. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle rows. The output has 1s in those positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions of 1s. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in positions that form a cross. In Example 4, the 1s are in positions that form a cross. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position relative to some central point.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical or horizontal line. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in the 6th column (index 5) for rows 3-5, and then in row 6, they are spread out. But this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 3 in the middle of the grid. The output replaces those 3s with 1s. But how?\n\nWait, looking at Example 3. The input has 3s in certain positions, and the output replaces them with 1s. For example, in the input's row 6, there's a 3 in column 5. The output has a 1 there. Also, in the input's row 7, there's a 3 in column 5, and the output has a 1 there. So maybe the 3s in certain positions are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are replaced? Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in the 6th column for rows 3-5. Then in row 6, they are spread out. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line, but that's not consistent across all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape. For example, in Example 1, the 1s form a cross in the middle. In Example 4, the 1s form a cross in the middle.\n\nLooking at Example 4's output, the 1s are in positions that form a cross. For instance, in the middle rows, there are 1s in the 5th column (index 4?), and also in the 5th row. So maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape.\n\nAnother idea: The transformation might involve replacing certain 3s with 1s in positions that are part of a cross. For example, in the input, if there's a 3 in a position that is part of a cross, it's replaced with 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a vertical line. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle of the grid. The output has 1s in those positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on their row and column. For example, if the row is between certain values and the column is between certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the row and column are in certain ranges. For example, in Example 1, the 3s are in the middle of the grid, and the 1s are in the same positions. But that's not the case. In Example 1, the input's 3s are in the first and second rows, and the output has 1s in the middle rows. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think about the positions of the 1s in each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 column 5 (index 5) is 1.\n\nRow 4: same as row 3.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 column 5.\n\nWait, no. Wait row 5 of output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 column 5 (index 5) is 1. Then row 6:\n\n2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 \u2192 columns 4 (index 4) and 6 (index 6) are 1s.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 4,5,6 (indices 4,5,6) are 1s.\n\nSo the 1s in row 5 and 6 are in positions that form a cross. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between certain values and the column is in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a vertical line. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like a vertical line in the middle of the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in column 5 (index 5) for rows 3-5, and then in row 6, they spread out.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape. For example, in the middle of the grid, there's a cross made of 1s.\n\nLooking at Example 4's output, the 1s are in positions that form a cross. For example, in row 3, the 1s are in column 4 (index 4?), and in row 4, they are in column 4. Then in row 5, they are in column 4. Then in row 8, they are in column 4. So that's a vertical line. Also, in row 7, there are 1s in column 4 and 5. So maybe the cross is a vertical line and a horizontal line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between certain values and the column is between certain values. For example, rows 3-6 and columns 4-6.\n\nBut how to find that pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid, and this is determined by the input's structure. For example, if the input has a certain pattern, then the 1s are placed in the middle.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined based on the input's structure. For example, if there's a 3 in the middle of the grid, then the 1s are placed in the cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at all examples, the output has 1s in certain positions. The key is to find what those positions are based on the input.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nThe input's rows 0,1,2 have 3s in the middle. The output's rows 0,1,2 have 3s in the middle, but rows 3-5 have 1s in certain positions. So maybe the 1s are added in the middle rows.\n\nAnother thought: The 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in column 5 (index 5) for rows 3-5, and in row 6, they are in columns 4 and 6. So maybe the vertical line is in column 5, and the horizontal line is in row 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between certain values and the column is between certain values. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a certain shape. For example, if the input has a 3 in a certain position, the output has a 1 in that position. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nIn the input, there are 3s in certain positions, and the output has 1s in those positions. For example, in the input's row 1, there are 3s in columns 2-4. The output's row 1 has 3s in columns 2-4, but also 1s in columns 8-9. Wait, the output row 1 is 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So the 1s are in columns 8-9 (indices 8 and 9?), but the input's row 1 has 0s in those positions. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output has 1s in positions that are part of a cross or vertical line. For example, in Example 1, the 1s form a vertical line in the middle. In Example 4, the 1s form a vertical line in the middle. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position relative to the middle of the grid.\n\nLet me think: For a 10x10 grid, the middle is around row 4 and 5, column 4 and 5. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), if it's in the middle column (say, column 4 or 5), and in certain rows, then it's replaced with 1. Or if it's in a certain range of rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in column 5 for rows 3-5, and in row 6, columns 4-6.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross. For example, the vertical line in the middle of the grid, and the horizontal line in the middle.\n\nSo, for a cell (i,j), if j is 4 or 5 (middle columns), then set to 1. Or if i is 4 or 5 (middle rows), set to 1. But this would create a cross.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output, the 1s are in the middle columns and rows. For example, in row 3, column 5 is 1. In row 5, columns 4-6 are 1s. So maybe this is the case.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nAnother idea: The 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in that range.\n\nBut how to determine that range. Maybe the middle of the grid is considered, and the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, which is determined by the input's structure. For example, if the input has certain patterns, then the 1s are placed in the cross.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a cross. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the test input and see what the output should be. But the test input is not given, so I can't look at that. However, the test input has a pattern of 2s and 3s. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position relative to the middle.\n\nLet me try to code a function that replaces certain positions with 1s. For example, in the middle of the grid, positions that are in a certain range.\n\nFor example, in the 10x10 grid, the middle is around row 4 and 5, column 4 and 5. So maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nLet me check Example 1's output. For rows 3-6 (rows 3,4,5,6) and columns 4-6 (columns 4,5,6). In the output, for row 3, column 5 is 1. Row 4, column 5 is 1. Row 5, columns 4-6 are 1. Row 6, columns 4 and 6 are 1. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 4's output, the 1s are in the middle columns (columns 4-6) for certain rows. For example, row 3 has 1 in column 4. Row 4 has 1 in column 4. Row 5 has 1 in column 4. Row 7 has 1 in column 4. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 1s in columns 8-9 for row 1. But that doesn't fit the previous pattern. Hmm. So this approach may not work for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid, and also in certain other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a vertical line. For example, in Example 1, the original value is 3 in the middle rows, and the output replaces those with 1s. But that's not the case for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6. But in Example 2, the output has 1s in columns 8-9 for row 1, which doesn't fit this pattern. So this approach may not be correct.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid. In Example 4, the 1s are in a vertical line in the middle. In Example 2, the output has 1s in certain positions, but not sure. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid.\n\nSo, the code could be: for each cell in the grid, if the column is between 4 and 6 (columns 4,5,6) and the row is between 3 and 6 (rows 3,4,5,6), then set to 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the input has 0s in those positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has 0s in those positions, but the output has 1s. So maybe the 1s are placed in those positions regardless of the input value. But that would mean that the 1s are placed in those positions, and the original value is replaced with 1. But this seems to fit some examples.\n\nBut looking at Example 2's output: for row 1, columns 8-9 are 1s. But according to the previous pattern, those columns are outside the 4-6 range. So this approach would not explain that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid, and also in certain other positions based on other patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6, or the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6. But this is the same as before.\n\nAnother idea: The 1s are placed in positions that form a cross. For example, the vertical line in the middle (columns 4-6) and the horizontal line in the middle (rows 4-6).\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6, and also in positions where the column is between 3 and 7 and the row is between 3 and 6. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross. For example, the vertical line is in column 4, and the horizontal line is in row 4.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the transformation as replacing certain positions with 1s, regardless of the input value. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain positions are replaced with 1s. This would explain the examples where 1s are placed in the middle.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\nfor each cell in the grid, if the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6, then set to 1. Otherwise, leave as is.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 1s are in those positions. For example, row 3, column 5 is 1. Row 4, column 5 is 1. Row 5, columns 4-6 are 1. Row 6, columns 4 and 6 are 1. So this fits.\n\nIn Example 4's output, the 1s are in positions that are in the middle. For example, row 3, column 4 is 1. Row 4, column 4 is 1. Row 5, column 4 is 1. Row 7, column 4 is 1. So this fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 1s in columns 8-9 for row 1. But according to the previous pattern, those columns are outside the 4-6 range. So this would not fit. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern for Example 2. Let's look at Example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input has 3s in certain positions. The output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the input's row 1, there are 3s in columns 2-4. The output's row 1 has 3s in columns 2-4, but also 1s in columns 8-9. So this suggests that the 1s are not just in the middle of the grid.\n\nThis indicates that the previous approach is not sufficient. So I need to think of another pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a certain shape. For example, if the original value is 3 and the position is in a certain pattern, then replace with 1.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: the 3s are in rows 0-2, columns 4-6. The output has 1s in rows 3-5, columns 4-6. So perhaps the 1s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 3s. Or maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and this cross is determined by the input's structure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid, and this line is determined by the input's structure. For example, if the input has a certain pattern, the line is in the middle.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the test input. The test input has a pattern of 2s and 3s. The output would have 1s in certain positions. But without knowing the correct output, it's hard to say.\n\nPerhaps the key is to find a pattern that works for all examples. Let's think of the following:\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid. In Example 2, the output has 1s in positions that are part of a vertical line and also in other positions. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle, and also in certain other positions.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6, or where the column is between 3 and 7 and the row is between 3 and 6. This would create a cross.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, which is determined by the input's structure. For example, if the input has a certain pattern, the cross is placed in the middle.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output of Example 3. The input has 2s and 3s. The output has 2s, 3s, and 1s. For example, in row 6, the input has 3 in column 5, and the output has 1 there. In row 7, the input has 3 in column 5, and the output has 1 there. So maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is in a certain range.\n\nBut how to determine that range.\n\nMaybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is in the middle of the grid. For example, if the original value is 3 and the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6, then replace with 1.\n\nBut this would explain Example 1 and Example 3, but not Example 2.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input has 3s in certain positions, but the output has 1s in other positions.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the 1s are placed in positions that form a cross. For example, in Example 1, the 1s form a vertical line in the middle. In Example 4, the 1s form a vertical line in the middle. In Example 3, the 1s are in the middle of the grid.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position in the middle of the grid.\n\nSo, the code could be: for each cell in the grid, if it is in the middle of the grid (rows 3-6 and columns 4-6), then set to 1. Otherwise, leave as is.\n\nBut this would mean that in Example 2, the 1s in columns 8-9 are not part of this pattern. But maybe the test input has a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the input's structure.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother idea: Let's think about the output of Example 1. The output has 1s in the middle of the grid. So perhaps the transformation is to replace all cells in the middle of the grid with 1s, regardless of their original value.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output has 1s in positions that are not in the middle. For example, in row 1, columns 8-9 are 1s. So this approach would not fit.\n\nHmm. This is very challenging. Maybe I need to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 4's output: the 1s are in positions that form a vertical line in the middle of the grid. For example, rows 3-7 have 1s in column 4. Also, in row 7, there are 1s in columns 4-6. So maybe the 1s are placed in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nMaybe the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 7 and the column is between 4 and 6. This would create a vertical line in the middle.\n\nSo, the code would be: for each cell (i,j), if i is between 3 and 7 (inclusive) and j is between 4 and 6 (inclusive), then set to 1. Otherwise, leave as is.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nExample 1's output has 1s in rows 3-5 (rows 3,4,5) and columns 4-6. Row 6 has 1s in columns 4 and 6. So this fits.\n\nExample 4's output has 1s in rows 3-7 (rows 3,4,5,6,7) and columns 4-6. This fits.\n\nExample 2's output has 1s in rows 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (but the input is 12 rows?), no, wait the input is 12 rows? Wait, the examples have different numbers of rows. Wait, the examples are:\n\nExample 1: 10x10 grid.\n\nExample 2: 12x12 grid?\n\nWait, looking at the input of Example 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n... (12 rows of 12 elements each)\n\nSo the input is 12x12 grid. The output is also 12x12. So for Example 2, the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid. For example, in row 1, columns 8-9 are 1s. But according to the previous pattern, the columns are 4-6, which doesn't fit. So this suggests that the previous pattern is incorrect.\n\nBut how to explain Example 2's output.\n\nMaybe the pattern is more complex. Perhaps the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid, and also in certain other positions based on the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the 1s are placed in the middle of the grid, and the code replaces those positions with 1s.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[cell for cell in row] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Check if the cell is in the middle of the grid\n            if 3 <= i <= 6 and 4 <= j <= 6:\n                transformed[i][j] = 1\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the output has 1s in rows 3-5 and columns 4-6. But row 6 has 1s in columns 4 and 6. So this code would set row 6, columns 4-6 to 1. But in Example 1's output, row 6 has 1s in columns 4 and 6, but not 5. So this code would set column 5 to 1 as well, which may not match the example.\n\nWait, the code would set all cells in rows 3-6 and columns 4-6 to 1. So for Example 1's output, row 6, column 5 would be 1, but in the example, it's 2. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in certain rows and columns. For example, in rows 3-6 and columns 4-6, but only for certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6, but only if the original value is 3. But this would mean that in Example 1, the 3s are replaced with 1s in those positions. But in Example 1's input, the 3s are in rows 0-2, columns 4-6. So this approach would not replace them.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll proceed with the assumption that the 1s are placed in the middle of the grid, and the code replaces those positions with 1s. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if 3 <= i <= 6 and 4 <= j <= 6:\n                transformed[i][j] = 1\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not fit all examples, but it's a starting point. Let's test it against the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the output would have 1s in rows 3-6 and columns 4-6. But in the example, the output has 1s in rows 3-5 and columns 4-6, and in row 6, columns 4 and 6. So this code would set row 6, column 5 to 1, which is not present in the example. So this code is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the 1s are placed in certain rows and columns, but not all of them.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the 1s are in positions that form a vertical line in the middle of the grid, but only in certain rows. For example, rows 3-5, and in row 6, only columns 4 and 6.\n\nMaybe the 1s are placed in the middle column (column 5) for rows 3-6.\n\nSo, for column 5, rows 3-6, set to 1.\n\nIn Example 1, this would set row 3, column 5 to 1; row 4, column 5 to 1; row 5, column 5 to 1; row 6, column 5 to 1. But in the example, row 6, column 5 is 2. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in column 5 for rows 3-5, and in row 5, columns 4-6.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces the middle of the grid with 1s, even if it doesn't fit all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a lot of 0s and 3s, and the output has some 3s and 1s. The output seems to have 1s replacing some 3s in certain positions. Maybe there's a pattern where 3s are replaced with 1s in specific areas. Also, the output has some 1s in the middle rows. Wait, in the input, the 3s are in the middle rows, and the output has 1s in those positions. But in the first example, the input's middle rows (rows 3-6) are all 0s except for the 3s. The output in those rows has 1s in certain positions. Hmm, maybe the 3s are being replaced with 1s in certain regions.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has some 2s and 3s. The output has 3s and 1s. For instance, in the first row of input, there's a 2 in the 10th column. The output's first row has 1s in the 9th and 10th columns. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 1s based on their position relative to some structure.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has 2s and 3s. The output has 2s, 3s, and 1s. For example, in the input's row 6, there's a 3 in the 5th column. The output has a 1 in that position. Also, in the input's row 7, there's a 3 in the 5th column, and the output has a 1 there. So maybe the 3s in certain positions are being replaced with 1s. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 4: The input has 0s, 2s, 3s. The output has 1s and 3s. For example, in the input's row 3, there's a 3 in the 4th column. The output has a 1 there. Also, in the input's row 4, there's a 3 in the 4th column, and the output has a 1. So perhaps there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced with 1s based on their location.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that form a sort of diagonal or cross shape. For example, in the middle rows, the 1s are in positions that form a vertical line. Also, in Example 4, the output has 1s in certain positions that might be part of a cross or a line.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain patterns with 1s. For example, if there's a 3 in a position that's part of a specific shape, it's replaced with 1. Or maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a certain structure, like a cross or a vertical line.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for positions where 1s are introduced. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in the 6th column (index 5?), but that's not clear. Wait, looking at the output of Example 1:\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 the 1 is in column 5 (index 5). Then row 4 has 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 same column. Then row 5 has 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 4,5,6. Then row 6 has 2s and 1s. So maybe the 1s are placed in a vertical line or a cross shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed where there's a certain pattern of 3s. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle rows. The output has 1s in those positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions of 1s. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in positions that form a cross. In Example 4, the 1s are in positions that form a cross. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position relative to some central point.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical or horizontal line. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in the 6th column (index 5) for rows 3-5, and then in row 6, they are spread out. But this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 3 in the middle of the grid. The output replaces those 3s with 1s. But how?\n\nWait, looking at Example 3. The input has 3s in certain positions, and the output replaces them with 1s. For example, in the input's row 6, there's a 3 in column 5. The output has a 1 there. Also, in the input's row 7, there's a 3 in column 5, and the output has a 1 there. So maybe the 3s in certain positions are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are replaced? Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in the 6th column for rows 3-5. Then in row 6, they are spread out. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line, but that's not consistent across all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape. For example, in Example 1, the 1s form a cross in the middle. In Example 4, the 1s form a cross in the middle.\n\nLooking at Example 4's output, the 1s are in positions that form a cross. For instance, in the middle rows, there are 1s in the 5th column (index 4?), and also in the 5th row. So maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape.\n\nAnother idea: The transformation might involve replacing certain 3s with 1s in positions that are part of a cross. For example, in the input, if there's a 3 in a position that is part of a cross, it's replaced with 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a vertical line. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle of the grid. The output has 1s in those positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on their row and column. For example, if the row is between certain values and the column is between certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the row and column are in certain ranges. For example, in Example 1, the 3s are in the middle of the grid, and the 1s are in the same positions. But that's not the case. In Example 1, the input's 3s are in the first and second rows, and the output has 1s in the middle rows. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think about the positions of the 1s in each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 column 5 (index 5) is 1.\n\nRow 4: same as row 3.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 column 5.\n\nWait, no. Wait row 5 of output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \u2192 column 5 (index 5) is 1. Then row 6:\n\n2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 \u2192 columns 4 (index 4) and 6 (index 6) are 1s.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 4,5,6 (indices 4,5,6) are 1s.\n\nSo the 1s in row 5 and 6 are in positions that form a cross. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between certain values and the column is in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a vertical line. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like a vertical line in the middle of the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in column 5 (index 5) for rows 3-5, and then in row 6, they spread out.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape. For example, in the middle of the grid, there's a cross made of 1s.\n\nLooking at Example 4's output, the 1s are in positions that form a cross. For example, in row 3, the 1s are in column 4 (index 4?), and in row 4, they are in column 4. Then in row 5, they are in column 4. Then in row 8, they are in column 4. So that's a vertical line. Also, in row 7, there are 1s in column 4 and 5. So maybe the cross is a vertical line and a horizontal line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between certain values and the column is between certain values. For example, rows 3-6 and columns 4-6.\n\nBut how to find that pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid, and this is determined by the input's structure. For example, if the input has a certain pattern, then the 1s are placed in the middle.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined based on the input's structure. For example, if there's a 3 in the middle of the grid, then the 1s are placed in the cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at all examples, the output has 1s in certain positions. The key is to find what those positions are based on the input.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nThe input's rows 0,1,2 have 3s in the middle. The output's rows 0,1,2 have 3s in the middle, but rows 3-5 have 1s in certain positions. So maybe the 1s are added in the middle rows.\n\nAnother thought: The 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in column 5 (index 5) for rows 3-5, and in row 6, they are in columns 4 and 6. So maybe the vertical line is in column 5, and the horizontal line is in row 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between certain values and the column is between certain values. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a certain shape. For example, if the input has a 3 in a certain position, the output has a 1 in that position. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nIn the input, there are 3s in certain positions, and the output has 1s in those positions. For example, in the input's row 1, there are 3s in columns 2-4. The output's row 1 has 3s in columns 2-4, but also 1s in columns 8-9. Wait, the output row 1 is 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So the 1s are in columns 8-9 (indices 8 and 9?), but the input's row 1 has 0s in those positions. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output has 1s in positions that are part of a cross or vertical line. For example, in Example 1, the 1s form a vertical line in the middle. In Example 4, the 1s form a vertical line in the middle. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position relative to the middle of the grid.\n\nLet me think: For a 10x10 grid, the middle is around row 4 and 5, column 4 and 5. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), if it's in the middle column (say, column 4 or 5), and in certain rows, then it's replaced with 1. Or if it's in a certain range of rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in column 5 for rows 3-5, and in row 6, columns 4-6.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross. For example, the vertical line in the middle of the grid, and the horizontal line in the middle.\n\nSo, for a cell (i,j), if j is 4 or 5 (middle columns), then set to 1. Or if i is 4 or 5 (middle rows), set to 1. But this would create a cross.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output, the 1s are in the middle columns and rows. For example, in row 3, column 5 is 1. In row 5, columns 4-6 are 1s. So maybe this is the case.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nAnother idea: The 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in that range.\n\nBut how to determine that range. Maybe the middle of the grid is considered, and the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, which is determined by the input's structure. For example, if the input has certain patterns, then the 1s are placed in the cross.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a cross. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the test input and see what the output should be. But the test input is not given, so I can't look at that. However, the test input has a pattern of 2s and 3s. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position relative to the middle.\n\nLet me try to code a function that replaces certain positions with 1s. For example, in the middle of the grid, positions that are in a certain range.\n\nFor example, in the 10x10 grid, the middle is around row 4 and 5, column 4 and 5. So maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nLet me check Example 1's output. For rows 3-6 (rows 3,4,5,6) and columns 4-6 (columns 4,5,6). In the output, for row 3, column 5 is 1. Row 4, column 5 is 1. Row 5, columns 4-6 are 1. Row 6, columns 4 and 6 are 1. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 4's output, the 1s are in the middle columns (columns 4-6) for certain rows. For example, row 3 has 1 in column 4. Row 4 has 1 in column 4. Row 5 has 1 in column 4. Row 7 has 1 in column 4. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 1s in columns 8-9 for row 1. But that doesn't fit the previous pattern. Hmm. So this approach may not work for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid, and also in certain other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a vertical line. For example, in Example 1, the original value is 3 in the middle rows, and the output replaces those with 1s. But that's not the case for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6. But in Example 2, the output has 1s in columns 8-9 for row 1, which doesn't fit this pattern. So this approach may not be correct.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid. In Example 4, the 1s are in a vertical line in the middle. In Example 2, the output has 1s in certain positions, but not sure. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid.\n\nSo, the code could be: for each cell in the grid, if the column is between 4 and 6 (columns 4,5,6) and the row is between 3 and 6 (rows 3,4,5,6), then set to 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the input has 0s in those positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has 0s in those positions, but the output has 1s. So maybe the 1s are placed in those positions regardless of the input value. But that would mean that the 1s are placed in those positions, and the original value is replaced with 1. But this seems to fit some examples.\n\nBut looking at Example 2's output: for row 1, columns 8-9 are 1s. But according to the previous pattern, those columns are outside the 4-6 range. So this approach would not explain that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid, and also in certain other positions based on other patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6, or the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6. But this is the same as before.\n\nAnother idea: The 1s are placed in positions that form a cross. For example, the vertical line in the middle (columns 4-6) and the horizontal line in the middle (rows 4-6).\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6, and also in positions where the column is between 3 and 7 and the row is between 3 and 6. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross. For example, the vertical line is in column 4, and the horizontal line is in row 4.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the transformation as replacing certain positions with 1s, regardless of the input value. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain positions are replaced with 1s. This would explain the examples where 1s are placed in the middle.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\nfor each cell in the grid, if the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6, then set to 1. Otherwise, leave as is.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 1s are in those positions. For example, row 3, column 5 is 1. Row 4, column 5 is 1. Row 5, columns 4-6 are 1. Row 6, columns 4 and 6 are 1. So this fits.\n\nIn Example 4's output, the 1s are in positions that are in the middle. For example, row 3, column 4 is 1. Row 4, column 4 is 1. Row 5, column 4 is 1. Row 7, column 4 is 1. So this fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 1s in columns 8-9 for row 1. But according to the previous pattern, those columns are outside the 4-6 range. So this would not fit. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern for Example 2. Let's look at Example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input has 3s in certain positions. The output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the input's row 1, there are 3s in columns 2-4. The output's row 1 has 3s in columns 2-4, but also 1s in columns 8-9. So this suggests that the 1s are not just in the middle of the grid.\n\nThis indicates that the previous approach is not sufficient. So I need to think of another pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a certain shape. For example, if the original value is 3 and the position is in a certain pattern, then replace with 1.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: the 3s are in rows 0-2, columns 4-6. The output has 1s in rows 3-5, columns 4-6. So perhaps the 1s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 3s. Or maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and this cross is determined by the input's structure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid, and this line is determined by the input's structure. For example, if the input has a certain pattern, the line is in the middle.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the test input. The test input has a pattern of 2s and 3s. The output would have 1s in certain positions. But without knowing the correct output, it's hard to say.\n\nPerhaps the key is to find a pattern that works for all examples. Let's think of the following:\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid. In Example 2, the output has 1s in positions that are part of a vertical line and also in other positions. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle, and also in certain other positions.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6, or where the column is between 3 and 7 and the row is between 3 and 6. This would create a cross.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, which is determined by the input's structure. For example, if the input has a certain pattern, the cross is placed in the middle.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output of Example 3. The input has 2s and 3s. The output has 2s, 3s, and 1s. For example, in row 6, the input has 3 in column 5, and the output has 1 there. In row 7, the input has 3 in column 5, and the output has 1 there. So maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is in a certain range.\n\nBut how to determine that range.\n\nMaybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is in the middle of the grid. For example, if the original value is 3 and the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6, then replace with 1.\n\nBut this would explain Example 1 and Example 3, but not Example 2.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input has 3s in certain positions, but the output has 1s in other positions.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the 1s are placed in positions that form a cross. For example, in Example 1, the 1s form a vertical line in the middle. In Example 4, the 1s form a vertical line in the middle. In Example 3, the 1s are in the middle of the grid.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position in the middle of the grid.\n\nSo, the code could be: for each cell in the grid, if it is in the middle of the grid (rows 3-6 and columns 4-6), then set to 1. Otherwise, leave as is.\n\nBut this would mean that in Example 2, the 1s in columns 8-9 are not part of this pattern. But maybe the test input has a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the input's structure.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother idea: Let's think about the output of Example 1. The output has 1s in the middle of the grid. So perhaps the transformation is to replace all cells in the middle of the grid with 1s, regardless of their original value.\n\nBut in Example 2, the output has 1s in positions that are not in the middle. For example, in row 1, columns 8-9 are 1s. So this approach would not fit.\n\nHmm. This is very challenging. Maybe I need to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 4's output: the 1s are in positions that form a vertical line in the middle of the grid. For example, rows 3-7 have 1s in column 4. Also, in row 7, there are 1s in columns 4-6. So maybe the 1s are placed in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nMaybe the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 7 and the column is between 4 and 6. This would create a vertical line in the middle.\n\nSo, the code would be: for each cell (i,j), if i is between 3 and 7 (inclusive) and j is between 4 and 6 (inclusive), then set to 1. Otherwise, leave as is.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nExample 1's output has 1s in rows 3-5 (rows 3,4,5) and columns 4-6. Row 6 has 1s in columns 4 and 6. So this fits.\n\nExample 4's output has 1s in rows 3-7 (rows 3,4,5,6,7) and columns 4-6. This fits.\n\nExample 2's output has 1s in rows 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (but the input is 12 rows?), no, wait the input is 12 rows? Wait, the examples have different numbers of rows. Wait, the examples are:\n\nExample 1: 10x10 grid.\n\nExample 2: 12x12 grid?\n\nWait, looking at the input of Example 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n... (12 rows of 12 elements each)\n\nSo the input is 12x12 grid. The output is also 12x12. So for Example 2, the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid. For example, in row 1, columns 8-9 are 1s. But according to the previous pattern, the columns are 4-6, which doesn't fit. So this suggests that the previous pattern is incorrect.\n\nBut how to explain Example 2's output.\n\nMaybe the pattern is more complex. Perhaps the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid, and also in certain other positions based on the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the original value is 3 and the position is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the 1s are placed in the middle of the grid, and the code replaces those positions with 1s.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[cell for cell in row] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Check if the cell is in the middle of the grid\n            if 3 <= i <= 6 and 4 <= j <= 6:\n                transformed[i][j] = 1\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the output has 1s in rows 3-5 and columns 4-6. But row 6 has 1s in columns 4 and 6. So this code would set row 6, columns 4-6 to 1. But in Example 1's output, row 6 has 1s in columns 4 and 6, but not 5. So this code would set column 5 to 1 as well, which may not match the example.\n\nWait, the code would set all cells in rows 3-6 and columns 4-6 to 1. So for Example 1's output, row 6, column 5 would be 1, but in the example, it's 2. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in certain rows and columns. For example, in rows 3-6 and columns 4-6, but only for certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 and the column is between 4 and 6, but only if the original value is 3. But this would mean that in Example 1, the 3s are replaced with 1s in those positions. But in Example 1's input, the 3s are in rows 0-2, columns 4-6. So this approach would not replace them.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll proceed with the assumption that the 1s are placed in the middle of the grid, and the code replaces those positions with 1s. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if 3 <= i <= 6 and 4 <= j <= 6:\n                transformed[i][j] = 1\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not fit all examples, but it's a starting point. Let's test it against the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the output would have 1s in rows 3-6 and columns 4-6. But in the example, the output has 1s in rows 3-5 and columns 4-6, and in row 6, columns 4 and 6. So this code would set row 6, column 5 to 1, which is not present in the example. So this code is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the 1s are placed in certain rows and columns, but not all of them.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the 1s are in positions that form a vertical line in the middle of the grid, but only in certain rows. For example, rows 3-5, and in row 6, only columns 4 and 6.\n\nMaybe the 1s are placed in the middle column (column 5) for rows 3-6.\n\nSo, for column 5, rows 3-6, set to 1.\n\nIn Example 1, this would set row 3, column 5 to 1; row 4, column 5 to 1; row 5, column 5 to 1; row 6, column 5 to 1. But in the example, row 6, column 5 is 2. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in column 5 for rows 3-5, and in row 5, columns 4-6.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces the middle of the grid with 1s, even if it doesn't fit all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n"
