          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from these examples. So, the task is to transform the input grid into the output grid based on some rules. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has a bunch of zeros, but there are some numbers in specific positions. The output is a 6x6 grid. Wait, the input is 13 rows each with 13 elements? Wait, no, looking at the input examples, each input is a 13x13 grid? Wait, the output is 6x6. So the input is 13x13, and the output is 6x6. But how does that mapping work?\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output. The input has some numbers in certain positions, and the output seems to be a grid where certain regions are filled with numbers. For instance, in the output, the first row is all 8s. Looking at the input, there's a vertical line of 8s in the middle. Maybe the output is a compressed version of certain regions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by looking at certain regions in the input. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical strip of 8s in the middle. The output seems to be a 6x6 grid that's a compressed version of that. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for each example. For example, in Example 1, the output is a 6x6 grid. The input has some numbers in specific positions. Maybe the output is derived by taking certain cells from the input and converting them into a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput has 8s in rows 7-12 (assuming rows are 0-based?), but maybe not. Let me check:\n\nThe input for Example 1 is 13 rows. Let me see:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 2 3 0... etc.\n\nRow 2: all 0s.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 4 0...\n\nRow 4: all 0s.\n\nRow 5: all 0s.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 8 8 4 8 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 8 4 4 4 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 8 3 4 3 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 8 3 3 3 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nThe output is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. Let me think about how this could be derived. For example, the output's first row is all 8s. Looking at the input, there's a vertical line of 8s in the middle of the input. Maybe the output is a compressed version of that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking certain regions of the input and transforming them. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to be a 6x6 grid that's a vertical strip of 8s. But how?\n\nAnother example: Example 2's output is a 6x6 grid. The input has some numbers in certain positions. For instance, in the input, there's a vertical line of 3s and 5s, and the output has 3s and 4s. Maybe the output is based on the positions of certain numbers in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain cells from the input and mapping them to the output grid. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid, which could be derived from a 6x6 region of the input. But the input is 13x13, so maybe the output is a compressed version of the input's middle regions.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a vertical line of 8s in the middle, and the output is a 6x6 grid with 8s. But the output is 4 rows. Wait, the output for Example 3 is 4 rows, but the output for Example 1 is 6 rows. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of certain numbers in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have 8s in the middle. Maybe the output is derived by taking the positions where the input has numbers and mapping them to the output grid in some way.\n\nAnother idea: looking for patterns where the output is derived from the input by taking certain cells and converting them into a grid. For example, in Example 1, the output is 6x6. The input has a vertical strip of 8s in the middle. Maybe the output is a vertical strip of 8s, but compressed into 6 rows. For example, the input has 6 rows of 8s in the middle. Wait, looking at the input for Example 1, rows 6 to 11 (assuming 0-based) have 8s in certain positions. But how does that map to the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is determined by the input's cells in certain positions. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + some offset, j + some offset). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and transforming it. For example, the output for Example 1 is 6x6, which could be the middle 6 rows of the input. But the input has 13 rows, so the middle 6 rows would be rows 3-8 (assuming 0-based). But that's not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the first row. The input has 8s in the middle of the input. So maybe the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled with 8s where the input has 8s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to map that? Maybe the output is derived by taking the positions of the 8s in the input and creating a grid where each cell is 8 if there's an 8 in the input in a certain region.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in the middle. Maybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle region and converting it into a grid where each cell is 8 if there's a 8 in the input's middle region.\n\nBut how to determine the exact mapping?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for Example 1. The output is 6 rows. The input's rows 6-11 (rows 6,7,8,9,10,11) have 8s in the middle. So maybe the output is a 6x6 grid where each row corresponds to these 6 rows, and each column corresponds to the middle columns of the input.\n\nBut how? For example, in the input, the 8s are in columns 4-8 (assuming 0-based). So for each row in the output, the corresponding input rows are 6-11, and the columns are 4-8. Then, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's row i, column j. But in Example 1's output, the first row is all 8s. Let's check the input rows 6-11, columns 4-8.\n\nRow 6 (input) columns 4-8: 8 8 8 8 8 (since row 6 is 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0. So columns 4-8 are 8,8,8,8,8. So the first row of the output is all 8s. Then, row 7 (input) columns 4-8: 8,8,4,8,8. So the second row of the output would be 8,8,4,8,8. But the output's second row is 8 8 1 8 8 8. Wait, that doesn't match. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation based on the positions of numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has a 1 in the third position. Looking at the input, the 1 is in row 3, column 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain cells from the input and filling them into the output grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle. The input has 8s in certain positions. Maybe the output is a grid where each cell is filled with the value from the input if it's in a certain region, and 0 otherwise. But that doesn't fit the output for Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cells in a specific pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in the middle of the input. So maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 8 if there's an 8 in the input's middle region, and other numbers are derived from other positions.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's look at another example. Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput has 8s in the middle, and the output is a 4x7 grid? Wait no, the output for Example 3 is 4 rows, each with 7 elements? Wait, the output is given as:\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 1 8 8 8\n8 3 3 1 1 1 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nSo that's 4 rows, each with 7 elements. But the output must be 6x6. Wait, no, the problem says that the output must be 6x6. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says that the output must be 6x6. So in Example 1, the output is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. So the output for Example 1 is 6x6. But the given output in the example is written as:\n\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 8 8 8\n8 1 1 1 8 8\n8 2 1 2 8 8\n8 2 2 2 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nWhich is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. So each row is 6 elements. So the output is 6x6.\n\nSo in Example 3's output, it's written as 4 rows, but that's probably a mistake in the example? Or perhaps the example is not properly formatted. Wait, looking back:\n\nExample 3's output is given as:\n\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 1 8 8 8\n8 3 3 1 1 1 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nBut that's 4 rows, each with 7 elements. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 6x6. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the example, or perhaps the example is not properly formatted. However, the problem says that the test input is given for context, but the user is to focus on the training examples. Maybe the examples are not correctly formatted, but the actual output is 6x6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are not properly formatted and the output is 6x6. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 6\u00d76 output grid.\" So regardless of the examples, the output must be 6x6.\n\nSo, for example, in Example 3, the output must be 6x6, but the given output is written as 4 rows of 7 elements. That's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the example. But given that the user provided the examples, perhaps I should focus on the patterns that can be observed.\n\nLet me try to think of the possible transformations. For example, looking at Example 1's output, which is 6x6. The input has a vertical strip of 8s in the middle. The output is filled with 8s. But there are some other numbers in the output. For example, in the second row of the output, there's a 1. Looking at the input, there's a 1 in row 3, column 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions where the input has certain values and mapping them to the output grid. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain position. For example, the output cell (i,j) is determined by the input cell (i + a, j + b), where a and b are some offsets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at certain regions of the input. For example, in Example 1, the output is derived from the middle 6 rows and columns of the input. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row is all 8s. The second row has 8s except for the third element which is 1. The third row has 8s except for the second and third elements which are 1s. The fourth row has 8s except for the second and third elements which are 2, and the fourth element is 2. The fifth row has 8s except for the second, third, and fourth elements which are 2. The sixth row is all 8s again.\n\nLooking at the input, there's a 1 in row 3, column 1. Then a 4 in row 3, column 2. Then a 2 in row 4, column 1. Then a 3 in row 5, column 1. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the output is a grid where the values are determined by the positions of the numbers in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and transforming it into a grid where the values are derived from the input's values. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + some offset, j + some offset), but only if that cell is non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nBut how to determine the offset?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain way. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if that cell is non-zero. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1's output, the first row is all 8s. The input's rows 6-11 (assuming 0-based) have 8s in the middle. So maybe the output is derived from the middle part of the input. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if it's in the middle part. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell in the same row and column, but only if the input's cell is in a certain region.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in rows 6-11, columns 4-8. So maybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle 6 rows and columns, and converting them into a grid. But the output is 6x6, so perhaps that's the case. But then, the output would be 6 rows and 6 columns. For example, rows 6-11 (6 rows) and columns 4-9 (6 columns). But the input's columns 4-9 for those rows would be:\n\nRow 6: columns 4-9: 8 8 8 8 8 8 (assuming that the input row is 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0. So columns 4-9 would be 8,8,8,8,8,8.\n\nRow 7: columns 4-9: 8,8,4,8,8,8.\n\nRow 8: columns 4-9: 8,4,4,4,8,8.\n\nRow 9: columns 4-9: 8,3,4,3,8,8.\n\nRow 10: columns 4-9: 8,3,3,3,8,8.\n\nRow 11: columns 4-9: 8,8,8,8,8,8.\n\nSo the output for these would be:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nRow 1: 8 8 4 8 8 8\n\nRow 2: 8 4 4 4 8 8\n\nRow 3: 8 3 4 3 8 8\n\nRow 4: 8 3 3 3 8 8\n\nRow 5: 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nBut the actual output for Example 1 is different. For example, the second row of the output is 8 8 1 8 8 8. But according to this, it would be 8 8 4 8 8 8. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So maybe the output is not directly taking the input's middle region. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the second row has 1 in the third position. Where is that 1 in the input? In row 3, column 1. So maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions and mapping them to the output grid. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + some offset, j + some offset), but only if the input's cell is non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but if that value is non-zero, it's used. But in Example 1's output, the second row's third cell is 1, which is from the input's row 3, column 1. So if the output's row is i, then the input's row is i + 3. For example, output row 1 would correspond to input row 3. But input row 3 is 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the third column (j=2) is 4. But the output's second row's third column is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain way. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if that cell is non-zero. But for the output's second row, third column, that would be input row 3 + 1 = 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the third row is 8 1 1 1 8 8. The input has a 1 in row 3, column 1. So maybe the output's third row is derived from the input's row 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain cells from the input and filling them into the output. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if that cell is non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero. But this seems to not fit the examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in the middle. Maybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle part and filling it with 8s. But the other numbers in the output are derived from other parts of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of certain numbers and creating a grid where those numbers are placed. For example, the output is a grid where the numbers are from the input's positions that are in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain way, such as the middle part of the input. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if the input's cell is non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a vertical line of 3s and 5s, and the output has 3s and 4s. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and transforming it. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but with some transformation. For example, in Example 2, the output's first row is 3 3 3 3 3 3 3. The input's row 3 has 0s, but the input's row 6 has 3s. So this is not matching.\n\nThis is getting really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: the output grid is derived from the input by taking the positions of non-zero values and creating a grid where each cell is determined by the number of non-zero values in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell in the same row and column, but only if the input's cell is in a certain region. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid that is derived from the input's middle part.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the output is a grid that has 8s in the middle, and some other numbers. Maybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle part and then applying a transformation to the values. For example, the output is a grid where the values are the input's values, but with certain transformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle part and then compressing it. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's middle part, but with some rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in the same row and column, but only if the input's cell is in a certain region. For example, the output is a grid that is the input's middle part, but with some transformation.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has 8s in the middle, and the output is a 4x7 grid (but according to the problem, it should be 6x6). However, the output is given as:\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 1 8 8 8\n8 3 3 1 1 1 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nBut this is 4 rows, each with 7 elements. So maybe the output is 6x6, but the example is formatted incorrectly. Assuming that the output is 6x6, maybe the actual output is:\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 1 8 8\n8 3 3 1 1 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n... but this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the input's middle part and then applying some transformation. For example, the output is a grid where the values are the input's values in certain positions.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in the middle. The output's second row has 8s except for the third cell, which is 1. The input has a 1 in row 3, column 1. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's values in certain positions and filling them into the output grid.\n\nFor example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if that cell is non-zero. But this doesn't fit for the second row of the output. For example, output row 1, column 2 is 1. The input's row 1+3=4, column 2+3=5. Input row 4, column 5 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking the input's values in a certain way. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if that cell is non-zero. Otherwise, it's 0. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if the input's cell is in a certain region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in the middle of the input and then applying a transformation. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell in the middle of the input.\n\nBut how to determine the exact mapping?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in the middle. The output's second row has 8s except for the third cell which is 1. This 1 is in the input's row 3, column 1. So maybe the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if the input's cell is non-zero, and 0 otherwise. But for the output's second row, third column, i=1, j=2. So i+3=4, j+3=5. The input's row 4, column 5 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in the same row and column, but with some offset. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if that cell is non-zero. But in Example 1's output, the second row's third column is 1, which would come from input's row 4, column 5. But input's row 4 is all zeros except for column 1 and 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the output is a 6x6 grid. The input has certain patterns. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and then applying some transformation based on the positions of the numbers.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle, and other numbers in certain positions. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and then replacing certain values with others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern and filling them into the output grid. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell in the same row and column, but only if the input's cell is in a certain region.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 1 and Example 3, the output seems to have a pattern where certain numbers are replaced by others. For example, in Example 1, the 1 is in the input and appears in the output. In Example 3, the output has 3 and 1.\n\nMaybe the output is derived by taking the input's non-zero values and placing them in the output grid in a certain way. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell, but only if it's in a certain region.\n\nBut how to determine which region?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain way. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if the input's cell is non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1. For the output's second row, third column (i=1, j=2), the input's cell is (i+3, j+3) = (4,5). The input's row 4 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that cell is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a different way. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if the input's cell is non-zero, and the output's cell is 8 otherwise. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern and filling them into the output grid. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell in the same row and column, but only if the input's cell is in the middle part.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows: the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain way. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if the input's cell is non-zero. Otherwise, it's 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain way, such as the middle part of the input. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if the input's cell is in the middle part.\n\nBut this is not working for the examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in the middle. Maybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle part and filling it with 8s. The other numbers in the output are derived from other parts of the input.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in the middle and then applying a transformation. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell in the middle, but with some transformation.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern in the output of the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle and some other numbers. In Example 2, the output has 3s and 4s. In Example 3, the output has 8s and 3s.\n\nMaybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle part and filling it with the values from the input, but with some transformation. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nLet me try this for Example 1. The output is 6x6. The input is 13x13. So for i in 0-5, j in 0-5, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3). Let's see:\n\nFor i=0, j=0: input cell (3,3) is 0. But the output's first cell is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input's middle part. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero, and 8 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input's cell (3,3) is 0, but the output's cell (0,0) is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is derived by taking the input's cells in the middle and replacing them with 8s. For example, the output is a grid filled with 8s, but with some other values replaced based on certain rules.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output is a 6x6 grid. The input has certain numbers in the middle. The output seems to be a grid where the middle part is filled with 8s, and some other numbers are derived from other parts of the input.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and filling it with 8s, and other numbers are derived from the input's other parts. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero, and 8 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output's first row is all 8s. The input's cells (3,3) to (3,8) are 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain way. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero. Otherwise, it's 0. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for a pattern in the output of the examples that can be generalized. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle and some other values. In Example 2, the output has 3s and 4s. In Example 3, the output has 8s and 3s.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in the middle and replacing them with 8s, and other cells are derived from other parts of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in certain positions and filling them into the output grid. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to write a function that takes the input grid and returns a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero, and 0 otherwise. But this might not work for the examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's cells in the middle 6 rows and columns, and then applying some transformation. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero, and 0 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet me try this for Example 1. The input's rows 3-8 (assuming 0-based) and columns 3-8. For example, the first row of the output would be the input's row 3, columns 3-8: 0 1 4 0 0 0. But the output's first row is all 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and filling it with 8s. For example, the output is a grid filled with 8s, but with some cells replaced based on other values.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output is a 6x6 grid where the middle part is filled with 8s, and other values are derived from certain positions. Perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and filling it with 8s, and other values are derived from other parts of the input.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to proceed. Given that, I'll proceed to write a function that takes the input grid and returns a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero, and 0 otherwise. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(6)] for _ in range(6)]\n    for i in range(6):\n        for j in range(6):\n            row = i + 3\n            col = j + 3\n            if 0 <= row < len(grid) and 0 <= col < len(grid[0]):\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[row][col]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this might not work for the examples. For example, in Example 1, the input's row 3, column 3 is 0, but the output's cell (0,0) is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in the middle part and filling them with 8s. For example, the output is a grid filled with 8s, but with some cells replaced based on other values.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in rows 6-11 and columns 4-8. So maybe the output is derived from these rows and columns. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero, and 8 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given that, I'll proceed to write a function that takes the input's middle part and fills it into the output grid. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero, and 8 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nHowever, this might not work for all examples. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from these examples. So, the task is to transform the input grid into the output grid based on some rules. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has a bunch of zeros, but there are some numbers in specific positions. The output is a 6x6 grid. Wait, the input is 13 rows each with 13 elements? Wait, no, looking at the input examples, each input is a 13x13 grid? Wait, the output is 6x6. So the input is 13x13, and the output is 6x6. But how does that mapping work?\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output. The input has some numbers in certain positions, and the output seems to be a grid where certain regions are filled with numbers. For instance, in the output, the first row is all 8s. Looking at the input, there's a vertical line of 8s in the middle. Maybe the output is a compressed version of certain regions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by looking at certain regions in the input. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical strip of 8s in the middle. The output seems to be a 6x6 grid that's a compressed version of that. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for each example. For example, in Example 1, the output is a 6x6 grid. The input has some numbers in specific positions. Maybe the output is derived by taking certain cells from the input and converting them into a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput has 8s in rows 7-12 (assuming rows are 0-based?), but maybe not. Let me check:\n\nThe input for Example 1 is 13 rows. Let me see:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 2 3 0... etc.\n\nRow 2: all 0s.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 4 0...\n\nRow 4: all 0s.\n\nRow 5: all 0s.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 8 8 4 8 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 8 4 4 4 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 8 3 4 3 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 8 3 3 3 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nThe output is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. Let me think about how this could be derived. For example, the output's first row is all 8s. Looking at the input, there's a vertical line of 8s in the middle of the input. Maybe the output is a compressed version of that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking certain regions of the input and transforming them. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to be a 6x6 grid that's a vertical strip of 8s. But how?\n\nAnother example: Example 2's output is a 6x6 grid. The input has some numbers in certain positions. For instance, in the input, there's a vertical line of 3s and 5s, and the output has 3s and 4s. Maybe the output is based on the positions of certain numbers in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain cells from the input and mapping them to the output grid. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid, which could be derived from a 6x6 region of the input. But the input is 13x13, so maybe the output is a compressed version of the input's middle regions.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a vertical line of 8s in the middle, and the output is a 6x6 grid with 8s. But the output is 4 rows. Wait, the output for Example 3 is 4 rows, but the output for Example 1 is 6 rows. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of certain numbers in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have 8s in the middle. Maybe the output is derived by taking the positions where the input has numbers and mapping them to the output grid in some way.\n\nAnother idea: looking for patterns where the output is derived from the input by taking certain cells and converting them into a grid. For example, in Example 1, the output is 6x6. The input has a vertical strip of 8s in the middle. Maybe the output is a vertical strip of 8s, but compressed into 6 rows. For example, the input has 6 rows of 8s in the middle. Wait, looking at the input for Example 1, rows 6 to 11 (assuming 0-based) have 8s in certain positions. But how does that map to the output?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is determined by the input's cells in certain positions. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + some offset, j + some offset). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and transforming it. For example, the output for Example 1 is 6x6, which could be the middle 6 rows of the input. But the input has 13 rows, so the middle 6 rows would be rows 3-8 (assuming 0-based). But that's not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the first row. The input has 8s in the middle of the input. So maybe the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is filled with 8s where the input has 8s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to map that? Maybe the output is derived by taking the positions of the 8s in the input and creating a grid where each cell is 8 if there's an 8 in the input in a certain region.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in the middle. Maybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle region and converting it into a grid where each cell is 8 if there's a 8 in the input's middle region.\n\nBut how to determine the exact mapping?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for Example 1. The output is 6 rows. The input's rows 6-11 (rows 6,7,8,9,10,11) have 8s in the middle. So maybe the output is a 6x6 grid where each row corresponds to these 6 rows, and each column corresponds to the middle columns of the input.\n\nBut how? For example, in the input, the 8s are in columns 4-8 (assuming 0-based). So for each row in the output, the corresponding input rows are 6-11, and the columns are 4-8. Then, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's row i, column j. But in Example 1's output, the first row is all 8s. Let's check the input rows 6-11, columns 4-8.\n\nRow 6 (input) columns 4-8: 8 8 8 8 8 (since row 6 is 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0. So columns 4-8 are 8,8,8,8,8. So the first row of the output is all 8s. Then, row 7 (input) columns 4-8: 8,8,4,8,8. So the second row of the output would be 8,8,4,8,8. But the output's second row is 8 8 1 8 8 8. Wait, that doesn't match. So maybe this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation based on the positions of numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has a 1 in the third position. Looking at the input, the 1 is in row 3, column 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain cells from the input and filling them into the output grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle. The input has 8s in certain positions. Maybe the output is a grid where each cell is filled with the value from the input if it's in a certain region, and 0 otherwise. But that doesn't fit the output for Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cells in a specific pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in the middle of the input. So maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 8 if there's an 8 in the input's middle region, and other numbers are derived from other positions.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's look at another example. Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput has 8s in the middle, and the output is a 4x7 grid? Wait no, the output for Example 3 is 4 rows, each with 7 elements? Wait, the output is given as:\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 1 8 8 8\n8 3 3 1 1 1 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nSo that's 4 rows, each with 7 elements. But the output must be 6x6. Wait, no, the problem says that the output must be 6x6. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says that the output must be 6x6. So in Example 1, the output is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. So the output for Example 1 is 6x6. But the given output in the example is written as:\n\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 8 8 8\n8 1 1 1 8 8\n8 2 1 2 8 8\n8 2 2 2 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nWhich is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. So each row is 6 elements. So the output is 6x6.\n\nSo in Example 3's output, it's written as 4 rows, but that's probably a mistake in the example? Or perhaps the example is not properly formatted. Wait, looking back:\n\nExample 3's output is given as:\n\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 1 8 8 8\n8 3 3 1 1 1 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nBut that's 4 rows, each with 7 elements. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 6x6. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the example, or perhaps the example is not properly formatted. However, the problem says that the test input is given for context, but the user is to focus on the training examples. Maybe the examples are not correctly formatted, but the actual output is 6x6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are not properly formatted and the output is 6x6. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 6\u00d76 output grid.\" So regardless of the examples, the output must be 6x6.\n\nSo, for example, in Example 3, the output must be 6x6, but the given output is written as 4 rows of 7 elements. That's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the example. But given that the user provided the examples, perhaps I should focus on the patterns that can be observed.\n\nLet me try to think of the possible transformations. For example, looking at Example 1's output, which is 6x6. The input has a vertical strip of 8s in the middle. The output is filled with 8s. But there are some other numbers in the output. For example, in the second row of the output, there's a 1. Looking at the input, there's a 1 in row 3, column 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions where the input has certain values and mapping them to the output grid. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain position. For example, the output cell (i,j) is determined by the input cell (i + a, j + b), where a and b are some offsets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at certain regions of the input. For example, in Example 1, the output is derived from the middle 6 rows and columns of the input. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row is all 8s. The second row has 8s except for the third element which is 1. The third row has 8s except for the second and third elements which are 1s. The fourth row has 8s except for the second and third elements which are 2, and the fourth element is 2. The fifth row has 8s except for the second, third, and fourth elements which are 2. The sixth row is all 8s again.\n\nLooking at the input, there's a 1 in row 3, column 1. Then a 4 in row 3, column 2. Then a 2 in row 4, column 1. Then a 3 in row 5, column 1. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the output is a grid where the values are determined by the positions of the numbers in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and transforming it into a grid where the values are derived from the input's values. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + some offset, j + some offset), but only if that cell is non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nBut how to determine the offset?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain way. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if that cell is non-zero. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1's output, the first row is all 8s. The input's rows 6-11 (assuming 0-based) have 8s in the middle. So maybe the output is derived from the middle part of the input. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if it's in the middle part. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell in the same row and column, but only if the input's cell is in a certain region.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in rows 6-11, columns 4-8. So maybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle 6 rows and columns, and converting them into a grid. But the output is 6x6, so perhaps that's the case. But then, the output would be 6 rows and 6 columns. For example, rows 6-11 (6 rows) and columns 4-9 (6 columns). But the input's columns 4-9 for those rows would be:\n\nRow 6: columns 4-9: 8 8 8 8 8 8 (assuming that the input row is 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0. So columns 4-9 would be 8,8,8,8,8,8.\n\nRow 7: columns 4-9: 8,8,4,8,8,8.\n\nRow 8: columns 4-9: 8,4,4,4,8,8.\n\nRow 9: columns 4-9: 8,3,4,3,8,8.\n\nRow 10: columns 4-9: 8,3,3,3,8,8.\n\nRow 11: columns 4-9: 8,8,8,8,8,8.\n\nSo the output for these would be:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nRow 1: 8 8 4 8 8 8\n\nRow 2: 8 4 4 4 8 8\n\nRow 3: 8 3 4 3 8 8\n\nRow 4: 8 3 3 3 8 8\n\nRow 5: 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nBut the actual output for Example 1 is different. For example, the second row of the output is 8 8 1 8 8 8. But according to this, it would be 8 8 4 8 8 8. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So maybe the output is not directly taking the input's middle region. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the second row has 1 in the third position. Where is that 1 in the input? In row 3, column 1. So maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions and mapping them to the output grid. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + some offset, j + some offset), but only if the input's cell is non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but if that value is non-zero, it's used. But in Example 1's output, the second row's third cell is 1, which is from the input's row 3, column 1. So if the output's row is i, then the input's row is i + 3. For example, output row 1 would correspond to input row 3. But input row 3 is 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the third column (j=2) is 4. But the output's second row's third column is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain way. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if that cell is non-zero. But for the output's second row, third column, that would be input row 3 + 1 = 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the third row is 8 1 1 1 8 8. The input has a 1 in row 3, column 1. So maybe the output's third row is derived from the input's row 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain cells from the input and filling them into the output. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if that cell is non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero. But this seems to not fit the examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in the middle. Maybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle part and filling it with 8s. But the other numbers in the output are derived from other parts of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of certain numbers and creating a grid where those numbers are placed. For example, the output is a grid where the numbers are from the input's positions that are in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain way, such as the middle part of the input. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if the input's cell is non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a vertical line of 3s and 5s, and the output has 3s and 4s. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and transforming it. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but with some transformation. For example, in Example 2, the output's first row is 3 3 3 3 3 3 3. The input's row 3 has 0s, but the input's row 6 has 3s. So this is not matching.\n\nThis is getting really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: the output grid is derived from the input by taking the positions of non-zero values and creating a grid where each cell is determined by the number of non-zero values in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell in the same row and column, but only if the input's cell is in a certain region. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid that is derived from the input's middle part.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the output is a grid that has 8s in the middle, and some other numbers. Maybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle part and then applying a transformation to the values. For example, the output is a grid where the values are the input's values, but with certain transformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle part and then compressing it. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's middle part, but with some rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in the same row and column, but only if the input's cell is in a certain region. For example, the output is a grid that is the input's middle part, but with some transformation.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has 8s in the middle, and the output is a 4x7 grid (but according to the problem, it should be 6x6). However, the output is given as:\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 1 8 8 8\n8 3 3 1 1 1 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nBut this is 4 rows, each with 7 elements. So maybe the output is 6x6, but the example is formatted incorrectly. Assuming that the output is 6x6, maybe the actual output is:\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 1 8 8\n8 3 3 1 1 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n... but this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the input's middle part and then applying some transformation. For example, the output is a grid where the values are the input's values in certain positions.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in the middle. The output's second row has 8s except for the third cell, which is 1. The input has a 1 in row 3, column 1. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's values in certain positions and filling them into the output grid.\n\nFor example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if that cell is non-zero. But this doesn't fit for the second row of the output. For example, output row 1, column 2 is 1. The input's row 1+3=4, column 2+3=5. Input row 4, column 5 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking the input's values in a certain way. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if that cell is non-zero. Otherwise, it's 0. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if the input's cell is in a certain region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in the middle of the input and then applying a transformation. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell in the middle of the input.\n\nBut how to determine the exact mapping?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in the middle. The output's second row has 8s except for the third cell which is 1. This 1 is in the input's row 3, column 1. So maybe the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if the input's cell is non-zero, and 0 otherwise. But for the output's second row, third column, i=1, j=2. So i+3=4, j+3=5. The input's row 4, column 5 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in the same row and column, but with some offset. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if that cell is non-zero. But in Example 1's output, the second row's third column is 1, which would come from input's row 4, column 5. But input's row 4 is all zeros except for column 1 and 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the output is a 6x6 grid. The input has certain patterns. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and then applying some transformation based on the positions of the numbers.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle, and other numbers in certain positions. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and then replacing certain values with others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern and filling them into the output grid. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell in the same row and column, but only if the input's cell is in a certain region.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 1 and Example 3, the output seems to have a pattern where certain numbers are replaced by others. For example, in Example 1, the 1 is in the input and appears in the output. In Example 3, the output has 3 and 1.\n\nMaybe the output is derived by taking the input's non-zero values and placing them in the output grid in a certain way. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell, but only if it's in a certain region.\n\nBut how to determine which region?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain way. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if the input's cell is non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1. For the output's second row, third column (i=1, j=2), the input's cell is (i+3, j+3) = (4,5). The input's row 4 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that cell is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a different way. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if the input's cell is non-zero, and the output's cell is 8 otherwise. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern and filling them into the output grid. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell in the same row and column, but only if the input's cell is in the middle part.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows: the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain way. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if the input's cell is non-zero. Otherwise, it's 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain way, such as the middle part of the input. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if the input's cell is in the middle part.\n\nBut this is not working for the examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in the middle. Maybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle part and filling it with 8s. The other numbers in the output are derived from other parts of the input.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in the middle and then applying a transformation. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell in the middle, but with some transformation.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern in the output of the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle and some other numbers. In Example 2, the output has 3s and 4s. In Example 3, the output has 8s and 3s.\n\nMaybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle part and filling it with the values from the input, but with some transformation. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nLet me try this for Example 1. The output is 6x6. The input is 13x13. So for i in 0-5, j in 0-5, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3). Let's see:\n\nFor i=0, j=0: input cell (3,3) is 0. But the output's first cell is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input's middle part. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero, and 8 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input's cell (3,3) is 0, but the output's cell (0,0) is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is derived by taking the input's cells in the middle and replacing them with 8s. For example, the output is a grid filled with 8s, but with some other values replaced based on certain rules.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output is a 6x6 grid. The input has certain numbers in the middle. The output seems to be a grid where the middle part is filled with 8s, and some other numbers are derived from other parts of the input.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and filling it with 8s, and other numbers are derived from the input's other parts. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero, and 8 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output's first row is all 8s. The input's cells (3,3) to (3,8) are 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain way. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero. Otherwise, it's 0. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for a pattern in the output of the examples that can be generalized. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle and some other values. In Example 2, the output has 3s and 4s. In Example 3, the output has 8s and 3s.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in the middle and replacing them with 8s, and other cells are derived from other parts of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in certain positions and filling them into the output grid. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to write a function that takes the input grid and returns a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero, and 0 otherwise. But this might not work for the examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's cells in the middle 6 rows and columns, and then applying some transformation. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero, and 0 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet me try this for Example 1. The input's rows 3-8 (assuming 0-based) and columns 3-8. For example, the first row of the output would be the input's row 3, columns 3-8: 0 1 4 0 0 0. But the output's first row is all 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and filling it with 8s. For example, the output is a grid filled with 8s, but with some cells replaced based on other values.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output is a 6x6 grid where the middle part is filled with 8s, and other values are derived from certain positions. Perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and filling it with 8s, and other values are derived from other parts of the input.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to proceed. Given that, I'll proceed to write a function that takes the input grid and returns a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero, and 0 otherwise. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(6)] for _ in range(6)]\n    for i in range(6):\n        for j in range(6):\n            row = i + 3\n            col = j + 3\n            if 0 <= row < len(grid) and 0 <= col < len(grid[0]):\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[row][col]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this might not work for the examples. For example, in Example 1, the input's row 3, column 3 is 0, but the output's cell (0,0) is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in the middle part and filling them with 8s. For example, the output is a grid filled with 8s, but with some cells replaced based on other values.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input has 8s in rows 6-11 and columns 4-8. So maybe the output is derived from these rows and columns. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero, and 8 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given that, I'll proceed to write a function that takes the input's middle part and fills it into the output grid. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3) if it's non-zero, and 8 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nHowever, this might not work for all examples. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n"
