          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 23x25. The input has some 2s, 1s, and 0s. The output seems to have some changes. For instance, in the first input row, all zeros except for some 2s and 0s. The output has some 2s and 1s. Wait, looking at the first example's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0 0 2 2 0 0 ... and output row 1 has 0 0 2 2 0 0... so maybe that's the same? But then in the third row of input, there's a 2 and 0s, and output has 2 and 0s. But in the third row of output, there's a 1 and 1 in the middle. Hmm, maybe some patterns are about replacing certain numbers with others?\n\nLooking at the first example's output, there's a 1 in the middle of some rows. Like in the third row of output, there's 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, the input for that row was 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the output has 1s in some positions where the input had 1s, but also added some 1s where there were 0s? Or maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with 1s based on some condition.\n\nLooking at the third row of input and output. The input had 1s in positions 6 and 7 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but the output has 1s in positions 6-7 and also 10-11. Wait, maybe it's about expanding certain regions. Like, if there's a 1 in the input, it's turned into 1s in a certain way. Or maybe it's about mirroring or some kind of expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced with others. For example, in Example 1, the input has some 2s and 1s, and the output has 2s and 1s. But maybe the 1s are being expanded or mirrored. Or perhaps it's about the positions of the numbers. For example, in the input, there are some 2s in certain positions, and the output has them in the same positions but with some other numbers added.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has 8s and 0s. The output has 8s and 0s, but some of the 8s are replaced with other numbers. For example, in the input row 2, there's 8 8 in positions 11 and 12. The output has 8 8 in those positions. But in the third row of input, there's 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0. So there's a 8 in positions 3 and 4, and then 8s in positions 8 and 9. Maybe some kind of mirroring or expansion. Also, in the output, there are some 1s added in certain places. For example, in row 5 of input, there's a 1 in position 5, and in the output, there's a 1 in position 5 and 6. So maybe the 1s are being expanded into adjacent cells?\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has 3s and 1s. The output has 3s and 1s. For example, in the input row 3, there are 3s in positions 3 and 4, and the output has 3s in those positions. But in the output, there's a 1 in position 5. Maybe the 1s are being added in certain positions based on the input's structure.\n\nHmm. It seems that there's a pattern where certain numbers (like 1s, 2s, 3s) are being expanded or mirrored. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for transformations that might be applied. For example, maybe the output grid is generated by replacing certain patterns in the input. For instance, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in positions (1,2) and (1,3), and the output has 2s in the same positions. But in the third row of input, there's a 1 in position 6 and 7, and the output has 1s in those positions and also in positions 10 and 11. So maybe the 1s are being expanded in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about flipping certain bits or applying some kind of mirroring. For example, in Example 2, the input has 8s in certain positions and the output has 8s in the same positions but also some new 8s added. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others. For example, in Example 1, the input has 2s and 1s, and the output has 2s and 1s. But in some cases, the 1s are being expanded into adjacent cells. For example, in the third row of input, there are 1s in positions 6 and 7, and in the output, there are 1s in positions 6-7 and 10-11. So maybe the 1s are being mirrored or expanded in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s or 2s based on some condition. For example, if a cell is 0, check its neighbors. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, there's a pattern where certain regions are filled with 1s. For example, in the third row of the output, there are 1s in positions 6-7 and 10-11. In the input, those positions had 1s. But in the input, maybe those 1s are part of a larger pattern that's being expanded. For instance, maybe the 1s are being expanded into adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a certain pattern. For example, in the input, if there's a 1 in a certain position, then the output has 1s in that position and adjacent positions. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. In the input, there's a 8 in position (2, 11) and (2,12). The output for that row has 8s in the same positions. But in another row, there's a 8 in position (3, 3) and (3,4), and in the output, there's 8s in those positions, but also in positions (3, 8) and (3,9). So maybe the 8s are being mirrored or expanded in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is 2, it's turned into 2, but if there's a 1, it's turned into 1s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about applying some kind of convolution or pattern matching. For example, if a cell is part of a certain shape, it's replaced with another value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about flipping certain bits. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that were 0 in the input. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a certain pattern. For example, in the input, if there's a 1 in a certain position, then the output has 1s in that position and adjacent positions. But again, how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has 3s in certain positions, and the output has 3s in the same positions. But in some rows, the output has 1s added. For example, in the input row 5, there's a 1 in position 5. In the output, there's a 1 in position 5 and 6. So maybe the 1s are being expanded into adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the input. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output in each example. For example, in Example 1, the output has some 1s where the input had 0s. Like in row 3 of input, the input had 0s in positions 10-11, but the output has 1s there. So maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s based on some condition.\n\nBut what's the condition? Maybe if there's a 1 in the input, then the output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the input, if a cell is 1, then the output has 1s in that cell and adjacent cells. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the input. But that doesn't fit all examples. For example, in Example 2, there are 8s in the input, and the output has 8s, but also some 1s. So maybe the 1s are being added where there are 0s adjacent to 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding certain patterns. For example, if there's a 1 in the input, then the output has 1s in that cell and adjacent cells. But how to implement that?\n\nLet me think about the first example. In the third row of input, the input has 1s in positions 6 and 7. The output has 1s in positions 6-7 and 10-11. So maybe the 1s are being expanded in a certain way. For example, maybe the 1s are being mirrored or expanded in a way that creates a new pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, in the input, if there's a 1 in a certain position, then the output has 1s in that position and adjacent cells. But again, how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about applying a certain rule to each cell. For example, if a cell is 0, then check its neighbors. If any neighbor is 1, then the cell becomes 1. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 1. In the third row of input, the input has 1s in positions 6 and 7. The output has 1s in those positions and also in positions 10-11. But according to the hypothesis, if a cell is 0, and any neighbor is 1, then it becomes 1. So in the input, the cell at position (2, 10) (assuming rows are 0-based) is 0. Its neighbors are (2,9) which is 0, (2,11) which is 0, (3,10) which is 0, and (1,10) which is 0. So that cell would not be changed. But in the output, that cell is 1. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s in certain positions where there are 2s or 1s. For example, in the first example, the output has 1s where the input had 2s. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about applying a certain pattern to each cell. For example, if the cell is 0, then it becomes 1 if there's a 1 in the same row or column. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, there are 1s in positions that are adjacent to 2s. For example, in row 3 of input, there's a 2 in position 2, and the output has a 1 in position 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a certain pattern in the input. For example, if there's a 2 in the input, then the output has a 1 in certain positions. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output in each example. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that were 0 in the input. Let's look at the third row of input and output. Input row 3 is:\n\n0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 3 is:\n\n0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the input had 0s in positions 10-11, and the output has 1s there. Also, the input had 0s in positions 12-13, but output has 0s there. So maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s in certain positions. But what determines those positions?\n\nLooking at the input row 3, the 1s are in positions 6 and 7. The output has 1s in positions 6-7 and 10-11. So maybe the 1s are being expanded in a certain way. Like, the 1s are being mirrored or extended. For example, the 1s in positions 6-7 are mirrored to positions 10-11. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, if there's a 1 in the input, then the output has 1s in that cell and adjacent cells. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about applying a certain pattern to each cell. For example, if the cell is 0, then check if there's a 1 in the same row or column. If yes, then set to 1. But in Example 1, the third row of input has 1s in positions 6-7. The cell at position 10 is 0. Its row has 1s in positions 6-7. So according to this rule, the cell at position 10 would become 1. Which matches the output. Similarly, the cell at position 11 would become 1. But why would that be the case?\n\nBut then, in the input row 3, the cell at position 12 is 0. Its row has 1s in positions 6-7. So according to this rule, it would become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me look at Example 2. In the input row 2, there are 8s in positions 11 and 12. The output row 2 has 8s in those positions. But in the input row 3, there are 8s in positions 3,4, 8,9. The output row 3 has 8s in positions 3,4, 8,9. So maybe the transformation is not changing the 8s. But in other parts of the input, there are 1s that are being replaced with 1s in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the input, but only in certain positions. For example, in the third row of input, the 1s are in positions 6-7, and the output has 1s in positions 6-7 and 10-11. So maybe the 1s are being expanded in a certain way. Like, the 1s are being mirrored to the right or left.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nAnother idea: look for the positions where the output has 1s that were 0 in the input. For example, in Example 1, the third row of output has 1s in positions 10-11. The input had 0s there. So maybe these positions are adjacent to 1s in the input. For example, position 10 is adjacent to position 9 (which is 0) and position 11 (0), but in the input, there's a 1 in position 6-7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about applying a certain rule based on the input's structure. For example, if there's a 1 in the input, then the output has 1s in that position and in certain other positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is part of a certain pattern. For example, in the input, if a cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row or column, then it becomes 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column. Let's test this with Example 1's third row. The input row 3 has 1s in positions 6-7. The output has 1s in positions 10-11. But position 10 is in the same row as the 1s. So according to this rule, the 0s in positions 10-11 would become 1. But what about position 12-13? In the output, those are 0s. So this rule would not apply there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding the 1s in certain directions. For example, if a 1 is in the input, then the output has 1s in that cell and in the cells to the left and right, but only if they are 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the same row or column, but only if the cell is in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of a row or column with 1s.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of the examples, there are some patterns where 1s are added in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are mirrored or expanded from the input's 1s. For example, in row 3 of input, the 1s are in positions 6-7, and the output has 1s in positions 10-11, which are mirrored from the left side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s in certain positions based on the input's 1s and 2s. For example, if a cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row or column, then it becomes 1. But this would require checking each cell.\n\nLet me try to implement this rule and see if it fits the examples.\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n- if grid[i][j] is 0, then check if there's a 1 in the same row or column. If yes, then set to 1.\n- else, keep the value.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the third row of input has 1s in positions 6-7. The cell at position 10 is 0. In the same row, there are 1s in positions 6-7. So according to this rule, the cell at 10 would become 1. Which matches the output. Similarly, the cell at 11 would become 1. But in the output, the cell at position 12 is 0. So why is that?\n\nHmm. The cell at 12 is in the same row as the 1s in positions 6-7. So according to this rule, it should become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this rule is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe it's not about the same row or column, but about the same diagonal or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column and the cell is in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the row or column.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the input, but only in certain positions. For example, in the third row of input, the 1s are in positions 6-7. The output has 1s in positions 6-7 and 10-11. So maybe the 1s are being expanded to the right by a certain number of cells.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is part of a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a certain shape, like a cross or something.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of the examples and try to find a pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are symmetric to the input's 1s. Like, in row 3, the 1s are in positions 6-7 and 10-11. So maybe the transformation is about mirroring the 1s in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding the 1s in certain directions. For example, if there's a 1 in the input, then the output has 1s in that cell and in the cells to the left and right, but only if they are 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the input and the cell is in a certain position relative to that 1.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about applying a certain rule to each cell, like replacing 0s with 1s if the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, in the input, if there's a 1 in a cell, then the output has 1s in that cell and adjacent cells.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column and the cell is in a certain position.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has 3s in certain positions, and the output has 3s in the same positions. But in some rows, the output has 1s added. For example, in input row 5, there's a 1 in position 5. The output has 1s in positions 5 and 6. So maybe the transformation is about expanding 1s into adjacent cells.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: for each cell in the input, if it's 1, then the output has 1s in that cell and in the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). But what about other cells?\n\nBut in Example 1, the third row of input has 1s in positions 6-7. The output has 1s in those positions and in 10-11. So maybe the 1s are being expanded in certain directions.\n\nBut how to determine the directions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the input in the same row or column, but only if the cell is in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is in a certain position relative to the 1s. For example, if a 0 is between two 1s in the same row, then it becomes 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about applying a certain pattern to the input grid. For example, in the input, if there's a 1, then the output has 1s in that cell and in certain positions based on the input's structure.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: look for the output of the examples and see if there's a pattern of 1s being added in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are symmetric to the input's 1s. Like, in row 3, the 1s are in positions 6-7 and 10-11. So maybe the transformation is about mirroring the 1s in the row.\n\nFor example, if a 1 is in position i, then in the output, there's a 1 in position (length - i - 1). But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. The third row of input has 1s in positions 6-7. The row has 25 columns. So length is 25. So for position 6, the mirrored position would be 25 - 6 - 1 = 18. But the output has 1s in position 10-11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about expanding the 1s in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, if there's a 1 in the input, then the output has 1s in that cell and in the cells to the left and right, but only if they are 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But given the examples, maybe the transformation involves replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the input and the cell is in a certain position. For example, if a cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row or column, then it becomes 1.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me try to write a function that for each cell in the input, if it's 0, check if there's any 1 in the same row or column. If yes, set to 1. Else, keep 0.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1's third row. The input has 1s in positions 6-7. The cell at position 10 is 0. In the same row, there are 1s in positions 6-7, so according to this rule, it should become 1. Which matches the output. Similarly, the cell at position 11 is 0, and in the same row, there are 1s, so it becomes 1. But the cell at position 12 is 0, and in the same row, there are 1s, so it should become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this rule is not correct.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to check if there's a 1 in the same row or column and the cell is not part of a certain pattern. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the input, but only in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in a certain position relative to the 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is in a certain position, like the center of the grid.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find any clues.\n\nTest Input:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 4 4 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 13: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 15: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 16: 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 17: 0 0 0 4 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 18: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 19: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 20: 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 21: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 0 4 0 0\nRow 22: 0 0 0 4 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nThe output for this test input is not provided, but the task is to write the transformation function based on the training examples.\n\nGiven that, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the input, but only in certain positions. For example, in the test input, there are 1s in certain positions, and the output would have 1s in those positions and possibly others.\n\nBut without knowing the output, it's hard to say.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to make an educated guess based on the training examples. Given that in the training examples, the output has 1s added where the input has 1s, and in certain positions, perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the input, but only in certain positions.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column. Let's try to code this and see if it fits the examples.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), if it's 0, check if there's any 1 in the same row or column. If yes, set to 1. Otherwise, keep 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's third row.\n\nInput row 3: [0,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nFor cell at position (3,10) (0-based?), which is 0. In the same row, there are 1s at positions 6 and 7. So according to this rule, it should become 1. Which matches the output.\n\nFor cell at (3,11), same logic: 1.\n\nFor cell at (3,12), which is 0. In the same row, there are 1s at 6 and 7. So according to this rule, it should become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this rule is not correct.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column and the cell is in a certain position, like not at the edge.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the input and the cell is in a certain position, like in the middle of the row.\n\nBut again, this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it might be the best guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    transformed = [[0]*cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if there's a 1 in the same row or column\n                has_one = False\n                for k in range(cols):\n                    if grid[i][k] == 1:\n                        has_one = True\n                        break\n                for k in range(rows):\n                    if grid[k][j] == 1:\n                        has_one = True\n                        break\n                if has_one:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column. Let's see if this fits the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the third row of input has 1s in positions 6-7. The cell at 10 would be 1, as per this code. But in the output, it is 1. The cell at 12 would be 1, but in the output it's 0. So this code would not match the example. Hence, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column and the cell is not in the first or last column or row.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column and the cell is in a certain position, like between two 1s.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern. For example, in the output of Example 1, the 1s are added in positions that are symmetric to the input's 1s. For example, in row 3 of input, the 1s are in positions 6-7, and the output has 1s in positions 10-11. So maybe the transformation is about mirroring the 1s in the row.\n\nLet's see: for each 1 in the input, the code adds 1s in the mirrored positions. For example, if a 1 is at position j, then add 1s at position (cols - j - 1).\n\nBut this would require checking for each 1 in the input and adding 1s in the mirrored positions.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, in row 3 of input, the 1s are at positions 6 and 7. The row has 25 columns. So mirrored positions would be 25 - 6 - 1 = 18, and 25 -7 -1 = 17. But in the output, the 1s are at positions 10-11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding the 1s in certain directions. For example, if there's a 1 in the input, then the output has 1s in that cell and in the cells to the left and right, but only if they are 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with a possible solution based on the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 1, the 1s are added in positions that are adjacent to the input's 1s. For example, in row 3 of input, the 1s are in positions 6-7. The output has 1s in positions 10-11, which are further to the right. But this doesn't seem to be a direct adjacency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is part of a certain pattern, like a cross or something.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column, but also check if the cell is in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the row or column.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the input, but only in certain positions like the middle of the row.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column, even though it doesn't fit all examples, but it might be the best I can do.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 23x25. The input has some 2s, 1s, and 0s. The output seems to have some changes. For instance, in the first input row, all zeros except for some 2s and 0s. The output has some 2s and 1s. Wait, looking at the first example's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0 0 2 2 0 0 ... and output row 1 has 0 0 2 2 0 0... so maybe that's the same? But then in the third row of input, there's a 2 and 0s, and output has 2 and 0s. But in the third row of output, there's a 1 and 1 in the middle. Hmm, maybe some patterns are about replacing certain numbers with others?\n\nLooking at the first example's output, there's a 1 in the middle of some rows. Like in the third row of output, there's 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, the input for that row was 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the output has 1s in some positions where the input had 1s, but also added some 1s where there were 0s? Or maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with 1s based on some condition.\n\nLooking at the third row of input and output. The input had 1s in positions 6 and 7 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but the output has 1s in positions 6-7 and also 10-11. Wait, maybe it's about expanding certain regions. Like, if there's a 1 in the input, it's turned into 1s in a certain way. Or maybe it's about mirroring or some kind of expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced with others. For example, in Example 1, the input has some 2s and 1s, and the output has 2s and 1s. But maybe the 1s are being expanded or mirrored. Or perhaps it's about the positions of the numbers. For example, in the input, there are some 2s in certain positions, and the output has them in the same positions but with some other numbers added.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has 8s and 0s. The output has 8s and 0s, but some of the 8s are replaced with other numbers. For example, in the input row 2, there's 8 8 in positions 11 and 12. The output has 8 8 in those positions. But in the third row of input, there's 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0. So there's a 8 in positions 3 and 4, and then 8s in positions 8 and 9. Maybe some kind of mirroring or expansion. Also, in the output, there are some 1s added in certain places. For example, in row 5 of input, there's a 1 in position 5, and in the output, there's a 1 in position 5 and 6. So maybe the 1s are being expanded into adjacent cells?\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has 3s and 1s. The output has 3s and 1s. For example, in the input row 3, there are 3s in positions 3 and 4, and the output has 3s in those positions. But in the output, there's a 1 in position 5. Maybe the 1s are being added in certain positions based on the input's structure.\n\nHmm. It seems that there's a pattern where certain numbers (like 1s, 2s, 3s) are being expanded or mirrored. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for transformations that might be applied. For example, maybe the output grid is generated by replacing certain patterns in the input. For instance, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in positions (1,2) and (1,3), and the output has 2s in the same positions. But in the third row of input, there's a 1 in position 6 and 7, and the output has 1s in those positions and also in positions 10 and 11. So maybe the 1s are being expanded in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about flipping certain bits or applying some kind of mirroring. For example, in Example 2, the input has 8s in certain positions and the output has 8s in the same positions but also some new 8s added. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others. For example, in Example 1, the input has 2s and 1s, and the output has 2s and 1s. But in some cases, the 1s are being expanded into adjacent cells. For example, in the third row of input, there are 1s in positions 6 and 7, and in the output, there are 1s in positions 6-7 and 10-11. So maybe the 1s are being mirrored or expanded in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s or 2s based on some condition. For example, if a cell is 0, check its neighbors. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, there's a pattern where certain regions are filled with 1s. For example, in the third row of the output, there are 1s in positions 6-7 and 10-11. In the input, those positions had 1s. But in the input, maybe those 1s are part of a larger pattern that's being expanded. For instance, maybe the 1s are being expanded into adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a certain pattern. For example, in the input, if there's a 1 in a certain position, then the output has 1s in that position and adjacent positions. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. In the input, there's a 8 in position (2, 11) and (2,12). The output for that row has 8s in the same positions. But in another row, there's a 8 in position (3, 3) and (3,4), and in the output, there's 8s in those positions, but also in positions (3, 8) and (3,9). So maybe the 8s are being mirrored or expanded in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is 2, it's turned into 2, but if there's a 1, it's turned into 1s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about applying some kind of convolution or pattern matching. For example, if a cell is part of a certain shape, it's replaced with another value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about flipping certain bits. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that were 0 in the input. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a certain pattern. For example, in the input, if there's a 1 in a certain position, then the output has 1s in that position and adjacent positions. But again, how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has 3s in certain positions, and the output has 3s in the same positions. But in some rows, the output has 1s added. For example, in the input row 5, there's a 1 in position 5. In the output, there's a 1 in position 5 and 6. So maybe the 1s are being expanded into adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the input. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output in each example. For example, in Example 1, the output has some 1s where the input had 0s. Like in row 3 of input, the input had 0s in positions 10-11, but the output has 1s there. So maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s based on some condition.\n\nBut what's the condition? Maybe if there's a 1 in the input, then the output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the input, if a cell is 1, then the output has 1s in that cell and adjacent cells. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the input. But that doesn't fit all examples. For example, in Example 2, there are 8s in the input, and the output has 8s, but also some 1s. So maybe the 1s are being added where there are 0s adjacent to 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding certain patterns. For example, if there's a 1 in the input, then the output has 1s in that cell and adjacent cells. But how to implement that?\n\nLet me think about the first example. In the third row of input, the input has 1s in positions 6 and 7. The output has 1s in positions 6-7 and 10-11. So maybe the 1s are being expanded in a certain way. For example, maybe the 1s are being mirrored or expanded in a way that creates a new pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, in the input, if there's a 1 in a certain position, then the output has 1s in that position and adjacent cells. But again, how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about applying a certain rule to each cell. For example, if a cell is 0, then check its neighbors. If any neighbor is 1, then the cell becomes 1. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 1. In the third row of input, the input has 1s in positions 6 and 7. The output has 1s in those positions and also in positions 10-11. But according to the hypothesis, if a cell is 0, and any neighbor is 1, then it becomes 1. So in the input, the cell at position (2, 10) (assuming rows are 0-based) is 0. Its neighbors are (2,9) which is 0, (2,11) which is 0, (3,10) which is 0, and (1,10) which is 0. So that cell would not be changed. But in the output, that cell is 1. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s in certain positions where there are 2s or 1s. For example, in the first example, the output has 1s where the input had 2s. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about applying a certain pattern to each cell. For example, if the cell is 0, then it becomes 1 if there's a 1 in the same row or column. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, there are 1s in positions that are adjacent to 2s. For example, in row 3 of input, there's a 2 in position 2, and the output has a 1 in position 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a certain pattern in the input. For example, if there's a 2 in the input, then the output has a 1 in certain positions. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output in each example. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that were 0 in the input. Let's look at the third row of input and output. Input row 3 is:\n\n0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 3 is:\n\n0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the input had 0s in positions 10-11, and the output has 1s there. Also, the input had 0s in positions 12-13, but output has 0s there. So maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s in certain positions. But what determines those positions?\n\nLooking at the input row 3, the 1s are in positions 6 and 7. The output has 1s in positions 6-7 and 10-11. So maybe the 1s are being expanded in a certain way. Like, the 1s are being mirrored or extended. For example, the 1s in positions 6-7 are mirrored to positions 10-11. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, if there's a 1 in the input, then the output has 1s in that cell and adjacent cells. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about applying a certain pattern to each cell. For example, if the cell is 0, then check if there's a 1 in the same row or column. If yes, then set to 1. But in Example 1, the third row of input has 1s in positions 6-7. The cell at position 10 is 0. Its row has 1s in positions 6-7. So according to this rule, the cell at position 10 would become 1. Which matches the output. Similarly, the cell at position 11 would become 1. But why would that be the case?\n\nBut then, in the input row 3, the cell at position 12 is 0. Its row has 1s in positions 6-7. So according to this rule, it would become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me look at Example 2. In the input row 2, there are 8s in positions 11 and 12. The output row 2 has 8s in those positions. But in the input row 3, there are 8s in positions 3,4, 8,9. The output row 3 has 8s in positions 3,4, 8,9. So maybe the transformation is not changing the 8s. But in other parts of the input, there are 1s that are being replaced with 1s in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the input, but only in certain positions. For example, in the third row of input, the 1s are in positions 6-7, and the output has 1s in positions 6-7 and 10-11. So maybe the 1s are being expanded in a certain way. Like, the 1s are being mirrored to the right or left.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nAnother idea: look for the positions where the output has 1s that were 0 in the input. For example, in Example 1, the third row of output has 1s in positions 10-11. The input had 0s there. So maybe these positions are adjacent to 1s in the input. For example, position 10 is adjacent to position 9 (which is 0) and position 11 (0), but in the input, there's a 1 in position 6-7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about applying a certain rule based on the input's structure. For example, if there's a 1 in the input, then the output has 1s in that position and in certain other positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is part of a certain pattern. For example, in the input, if a cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row or column, then it becomes 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column. Let's test this with Example 1's third row. The input row 3 has 1s in positions 6-7. The output has 1s in positions 10-11. But position 10 is in the same row as the 1s. So according to this rule, the 0s in positions 10-11 would become 1. But what about position 12-13? In the output, those are 0s. So this rule would not apply there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding the 1s in certain directions. For example, if a 1 is in the input, then the output has 1s in that cell and in the cells to the left and right, but only if they are 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the same row or column, but only if the cell is in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of a row or column with 1s.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of the examples, there are some patterns where 1s are added in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are mirrored or expanded from the input's 1s. For example, in row 3 of input, the 1s are in positions 6-7, and the output has 1s in positions 10-11, which are mirrored from the left side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s in certain positions based on the input's 1s and 2s. For example, if a cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row or column, then it becomes 1. But this would require checking each cell.\n\nLet me try to implement this rule and see if it fits the examples.\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n- if grid[i][j] is 0, then check if there's a 1 in the same row or column. If yes, then set to 1.\n- else, keep the value.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the third row of input has 1s in positions 6-7. The cell at position 10 is 0. In the same row, there are 1s in positions 6-7. So according to this rule, the cell at 10 would become 1. Which matches the output. Similarly, the cell at 11 would become 1. But in the output, the cell at position 12 is 0. So why is that?\n\nHmm. The cell at 12 is in the same row as the 1s in positions 6-7. So according to this rule, it should become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this rule is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe it's not about the same row or column, but about the same diagonal or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column and the cell is in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the row or column.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the input, but only in certain positions. For example, in the third row of input, the 1s are in positions 6-7. The output has 1s in positions 6-7 and 10-11. So maybe the 1s are being expanded to the right by a certain number of cells.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is part of a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a certain shape, like a cross or something.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of the examples and try to find a pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are symmetric to the input's 1s. Like, in row 3, the 1s are in positions 6-7 and 10-11. So maybe the transformation is about mirroring the 1s in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding the 1s in certain directions. For example, if there's a 1 in the input, then the output has 1s in that cell and in the cells to the left and right, but only if they are 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the input and the cell is in a certain position relative to that 1.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about applying a certain rule to each cell, like replacing 0s with 1s if the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, in the input, if there's a 1 in a cell, then the output has 1s in that cell and adjacent cells.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column and the cell is in a certain position.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has 3s in certain positions, and the output has 3s in the same positions. But in some rows, the output has 1s added. For example, in input row 5, there's a 1 in position 5. The output has 1s in positions 5 and 6. So maybe the transformation is about expanding 1s into adjacent cells.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: for each cell in the input, if it's 1, then the output has 1s in that cell and in the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). But what about other cells?\n\nBut in Example 1, the third row of input has 1s in positions 6-7. The output has 1s in those positions and in 10-11. So maybe the 1s are being expanded in certain directions.\n\nBut how to determine the directions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the input in the same row or column, but only if the cell is in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is in a certain position relative to the 1s. For example, if a 0 is between two 1s in the same row, then it becomes 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about applying a certain pattern to the input grid. For example, in the input, if there's a 1, then the output has 1s in that cell and in certain positions based on the input's structure.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: look for the output of the examples and see if there's a pattern of 1s being added in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are symmetric to the input's 1s. Like, in row 3, the 1s are in positions 6-7 and 10-11. So maybe the transformation is about mirroring the 1s in the row.\n\nFor example, if a 1 is in position i, then in the output, there's a 1 in position (length - i - 1). But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. The third row of input has 1s in positions 6-7. The row has 25 columns. So length is 25. So for position 6, the mirrored position would be 25 - 6 - 1 = 18. But the output has 1s in position 10-11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about expanding the 1s in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, if there's a 1 in the input, then the output has 1s in that cell and in the cells to the left and right, but only if they are 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But given the examples, maybe the transformation involves replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the input and the cell is in a certain position. For example, if a cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row or column, then it becomes 1.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me try to write a function that for each cell in the input, if it's 0, check if there's any 1 in the same row or column. If yes, set to 1. Else, keep 0.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1's third row. The input has 1s in positions 6-7. The cell at position 10 is 0. In the same row, there are 1s in positions 6-7, so according to this rule, it should become 1. Which matches the output. Similarly, the cell at position 11 is 0, and in the same row, there are 1s, so it becomes 1. But the cell at position 12 is 0, and in the same row, there are 1s, so it should become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this rule is not correct.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to check if there's a 1 in the same row or column and the cell is not part of a certain pattern. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the input, but only in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in a certain position relative to the 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is in a certain position, like the center of the grid.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find any clues.\n\nTest Input:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 4 4 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 13: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 15: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 16: 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 17: 0 0 0 4 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 18: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 19: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 20: 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 21: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 0 4 0 0\nRow 22: 0 0 0 4 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nThe output for this test input is not provided, but the task is to write the transformation function based on the training examples.\n\nGiven that, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the input, but only in certain positions. For example, in the test input, there are 1s in certain positions, and the output would have 1s in those positions and possibly others.\n\nBut without knowing the output, it's hard to say.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to make an educated guess based on the training examples. Given that in the training examples, the output has 1s added where the input has 1s, and in certain positions, perhaps the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the input, but only in certain positions.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column. Let's try to code this and see if it fits the examples.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), if it's 0, check if there's any 1 in the same row or column. If yes, set to 1. Otherwise, keep 0.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's third row.\n\nInput row 3: [0,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nFor cell at position (3,10) (0-based?), which is 0. In the same row, there are 1s at positions 6 and 7. So according to this rule, it should become 1. Which matches the output.\n\nFor cell at (3,11), same logic: 1.\n\nFor cell at (3,12), which is 0. In the same row, there are 1s at 6 and 7. So according to this rule, it should become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this rule is not correct.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column and the cell is in a certain position, like not at the edge.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the input and the cell is in a certain position, like in the middle of the row.\n\nBut again, this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it might be the best guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    transformed = [[0]*cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if there's a 1 in the same row or column\n                has_one = False\n                for k in range(cols):\n                    if grid[i][k] == 1:\n                        has_one = True\n                        break\n                for k in range(rows):\n                    if grid[k][j] == 1:\n                        has_one = True\n                        break\n                if has_one:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column. Let's see if this fits the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the third row of input has 1s in positions 6-7. The cell at 10 would be 1, as per this code. But in the output, it is 1. The cell at 12 would be 1, but in the output it's 0. So this code would not match the example. Hence, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column and the cell is not in the first or last column or row.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column and the cell is in a certain position, like between two 1s.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern. For example, in the output of Example 1, the 1s are added in positions that are symmetric to the input's 1s. For example, in row 3 of input, the 1s are in positions 6-7, and the output has 1s in positions 10-11. So maybe the transformation is about mirroring the 1s in the row.\n\nLet's see: for each 1 in the input, the code adds 1s in the mirrored positions. For example, if a 1 is at position j, then add 1s at position (cols - j - 1).\n\nBut this would require checking for each 1 in the input and adding 1s in the mirrored positions.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, in row 3 of input, the 1s are at positions 6 and 7. The row has 25 columns. So mirrored positions would be 25 - 6 - 1 = 18, and 25 -7 -1 = 17. But in the output, the 1s are at positions 10-11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding the 1s in certain directions. For example, if there's a 1 in the input, then the output has 1s in that cell and in the cells to the left and right, but only if they are 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with a possible solution based on the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 1, the 1s are added in positions that are adjacent to the input's 1s. For example, in row 3 of input, the 1s are in positions 6-7. The output has 1s in positions 10-11, which are further to the right. But this doesn't seem to be a direct adjacency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where the cell is part of a certain pattern, like a cross or something.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column, but also check if the cell is in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the row or column.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s where there's a 1 in the input, but only in certain positions like the middle of the row.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s with 1s if there's a 1 in the same row or column, even though it doesn't fit all examples, but it might be the best I can do.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n"
