          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nThe input has rows with numbers like 0, 2, 2, 0, 8, etc. The output seems to have some patterns where certain numbers are repeated. For instance, in the first input row, the output is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So it looks like the 2s are being spread out in a way. Also, there's a 5 in the input that's replaced by 2s in the output. Wait, maybe the 5s are being replaced by 2s? Or maybe there's a pattern based on the positions of certain numbers.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row of input is 0 0 0 0 8 0 5 5 0 8 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 5s in the input are replaced by 2s. Also, the 8s are kept as 8s. But why are the 2s appearing in certain positions?\n\nAnother observation: in the input, there are some rows that have 8s in all positions. For example, the fifth row in Example 1's input is all 8s. The output for that row is also all 8s. So maybe that's a case where the 8s are left as is. But other rows have different patterns.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has rows with 3s, 4s, 2s, 8s, etc. The output seems to have similar patterns. For example, in the first input row of Example 2, the output is the same as the input. But in the second row, the input is 0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0, and the output is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the 4s are being spread out, and the 3s are kept. But there's also a 3 in the input that's replaced by a 4 in some positions. Wait, maybe the 4s are being extended in certain positions.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are being replaced based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are being replaced by 2s. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look at the positions where the numbers change. For instance, in Example 1, the input has a row with 0 2 2 0 8 0 5 5 0 8 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 5s in the input are replaced by 2s. But why? Maybe the 5s are in positions where the original numbers are 5, and they are being replaced by 2s. But then, in the third row of Example 1's input, the input is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0, and the output is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. So here, the 5s are replaced by 2s, but also the 0s are being replaced by 2s in some positions. Wait, maybe the 2s are being spread out in certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced by 2s, and the 0s are being replaced by 2s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. For instance, the first input row is all 0s and 3s. The output is the same as the input. But the second input row has 0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the 4s are being spread out. The 3s are kept. So maybe the 4s are being expanded in certain positions. But how?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell has a certain value, it's replaced by another value based on some rule. But I need to find a pattern that applies across the examples.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row of input has 0s and 8s. The output has 2s in positions where the input had 0s and 8s. Wait, maybe not. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input row: 0 0 0 0 8 0 5 5 0 8 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0\n\nSo the 0s in positions 0,1,2,3,5,8,11,12,13 are being replaced by 2s in positions 1,2, etc. Maybe the 0s are being replaced by 2s in certain positions based on their neighbors. For example, the 0s that are between 2s or 8s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that if a cell is 0, it's replaced by 2 if the cell is in a certain position. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the third row of input is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced by 2s, and the 5s are replaced by 2s. But why? Maybe the 0s are being replaced by 2s if there's a 2 in the same row or column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being spread out in certain patterns. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in positions where the input had 0s and 5s. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nIn Example 2, the first input row is 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output is the same as the input. So maybe that's a case where the 3s are left as is. But then in the second input row, the 4s are spread out. So perhaps the 4s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions. But why?\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for the fifth row (all 8s) is the same as the input. So 8s are left as is. In other rows, the 8s are kept. But in other rows, the 5s are replaced by 2s. So maybe the 5s are being replaced by 2s, and the 0s are being replaced by 2s in certain positions. But how to determine that.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 0, it's replaced by 2 if the cell is in a certain position. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, then it's replaced by 2 if the cell is in a certain row or column. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output differs from the input. For example, in Example 1, the first input row has 0s and 8s, and the output has 2s in certain positions. Maybe the 2s are being added where there's a 0 and a 5 in the input. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in the first example, the 5s are replaced by 2s. But why?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the third row of input is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced by 2s, and the 5s are replaced by 2s. So maybe any cell that is 0 or 5 is replaced by 2. But that's not the case in the first row of input. In the first row of input, the 5s are replaced by 2s, but the 0s are not replaced by 2s. Wait, in the first input row, the 0s are in positions 0,1,2,3,5,8,11,12,13. The output has 2s in positions 1,2, etc. For example, the first input row's output is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 0s in positions 0,3,5,8,11,12,13 are kept as 0, but the 0s in positions 1,2, etc. are replaced by 2s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced by 2s if they are between certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in certain patterns. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in positions where the input had 0s and 5s. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the 2s are placed in positions where the original cell is 0 and the cell is in a certain column. For example, in the first row of input, the 0s are in columns 0,1,2,3,5,8, etc. The output has 2s in columns 1,2, etc. So maybe the 2s are being placed in positions that are even or odd, or based on some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain position. For example, in the first example, the output's first row has 2s in columns 1,2, etc. Maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original cell is 0 and the row is even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row of output has 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 2s are in positions 1,2,6,7,10,11, etc. Maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the column is even or odd. Wait, columns are 0-based. So columns 1 and 2 are even? Or maybe it's based on the row.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 0 (first row) has 2s in columns 1,2,6,7,10,11. These columns are 1-2 (positions 1 and 2), then 6-7 (columns 6 and 7), then 10-11 (columns 10 and 11). So this seems like a pattern where 2s are placed in pairs in certain positions. Similarly, in row 2 of Example 1's output, the row is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. So all the 0s are replaced by 2s, and the 8s are kept.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain row or column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the 2s are placed in positions where the original cell is 0 and the row is even. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original cell is 0 and the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in positions that are even columns. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain position. For example, in the first example, the output for row 0 has 2s in columns 1,2,6,7,10,11. These are columns where the original input had 0s. But why those columns?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the 2s are being added in a way that forms horizontal lines. For example, in row 0 of Example 1, the 2s are in positions 1-2, then 6-7, then 10-11. This could be a pattern of horizontal lines. Similarly, in row 2 of Example 1, the entire row is filled with 2s except for the 8s. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 0s are replaced by 2s, but in others, they are not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value. For example, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain row or column. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 2, in the second row, the input is 0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the 4s are being spread out in certain positions. For example, the 4s are in positions 0,1,3,5,6,7, etc. So maybe the 4s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe the transformation is that if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is even (like row 0, 2, 4, etc.), then replace 0s with 2s in certain positions. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if a cell is 0 and the cell to the left is 2, then replace it with 2. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the third row of input is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced by 2s, and the 5s are replaced by 2s. So maybe any cell that is 0 or 5 is replaced by 2. But in the first row of input, the 5s are replaced by 2s, but the 0s are not replaced by 2s. Wait, in the first row of input, the 0s are in positions 0,1,2,3,5,8,11,12,13. The output has 0s in positions 0,3,5,8,11,12,13, but 2s in positions 1,2,6,7,10,11. So maybe the 0s are replaced by 2s if they are between certain values. For example, if there's a 2 in the same row, then the 0 is replaced by 2. But that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain column. For example, columns 1,2,6,7,10,11 in row 0 of Example 1. These columns are 1 and 2 (positions 1 and 2), then 6 and 7 (positions 6 and 7), then 10 and 11 (positions 10 and 11). So these are positions that are even or odd. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 2s are being added in positions that are even columns, but that's not the case for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the column index is even or odd. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 0 is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 2s are in positions that are even columns (1 and 2, 6 and 7, 10 and 11). Wait, columns are 0-based. So columns 1 and 2 are odd and even? Not sure. But the pattern is that the 2s are in pairs of columns. Like, positions 1-2, 6-7, 10-11. These are positions that are spaced 5 apart. For example, 1 and 2, then 6 and 7 (which is 5 more than 1), then 10 and 11 (5 more than 6). So perhaps the pattern is that in each row, the 2s are placed in pairs of columns that are 5 apart. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 2s are being added in positions that are in certain columns based on the row's position. For example, in even rows, the 2s are placed in certain columns.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should try to think of a general rule that can be applied to both examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, for the second row, the input is 0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the 4s are being spread out in certain positions. The original 4s are in positions 1 and 2, then 0 is replaced by 4, then 3 is replaced by 4, etc. So maybe the 4s are being spread out in a way that creates a pattern of 4s in certain positions.\n\nAnother idea: the output for each cell is determined by the original cell's value and the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the original cell is 0 and there's a 2 in the same row, then replace it with 2. But this might not hold for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain row or column. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in positions where the original cell is 0 and the row is even. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the row's index. For example, in rows where the row index is even, replace 0s with 2s in certain columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where the output differs from the input. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 0 has 2s in certain positions where the input was 0 or 5. But in other rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added where the original value is 0 and the cell is in a certain column. For example, columns that are even or odd.\n\nBut this is not leading me anywhere. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing certain values with others and applying some pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 0 has 2s in positions that are even columns. For example, columns 1 and 2 are 1 and 2 (odd and even). Wait, no. Maybe the pattern is that the 2s are placed in positions where the column index is even. But in row 0, the 2s are in columns 1, 2, 6, 7, 10, 11. These are odd and even columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the column index is divisible by 2. But 1 is not divisible by 2. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the column index is not divisible by 4. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a row that is even or odd. For example, in row 0, which is even, replace 0s with 2s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the value of the original cell and the row. For example, in rows where the original value is 0, replace it with 2 if the row is even.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the third row of input is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced by 2s, and the 5s are replaced by 2s. So maybe any cell that is 0 or 5 is replaced by 2. But in the first row of input, the 5s are replaced by 2s, but the 0s are not replaced by 2s in all positions. For example, in the first row of input, the 0s are in positions 0,1,2,3,5,8,11,12,13. The output has 0s in positions 0,3,5,8,11,12,13, but 2s in positions 1,2,6,7,10,11. So maybe the 0s are replaced by 2s only if there's a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a row that has a 2 in the same row. For example, in row 0 of Example 1, there are 2s in the input. So the 0s in positions 1 and 2 are replaced by 2s. But the 0s in positions 0,3,5,8, etc. are not replaced by 2s.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain column. For example, columns 1,2,6,7,10,11 in row 0.\n\nBut this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 2s are being added in positions where the original cell is 0 and the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in rows where the original value is 0, replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain position.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother approach: look for the output in Example 2. In the second row of input, the output is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the 4s are being spread out in certain positions. The original input has 4s in positions 1 and 2, and 0s elsewhere. The output has 4s in positions 0,1,3,5,6,7, etc. So it seems like the 4s are being expanded to fill certain positions.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with the value of the cell to the left or right, or based on some other rule.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a row that has a certain pattern. For example, in rows where the original value is 0, replace with 2 if the row is even.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that can explain both examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for rows with 0s and 5s are replaced by 2s. For example, the 5s are replaced by 2s, and the 0s are replaced by 2s in certain positions. In Example 2, the 3s are kept, and the 4s are replaced by 4s in certain positions. So perhaps the transformation is that certain values are replaced by others, and the replacement is based on the original value and the position.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for rows that have 8s in all positions are unchanged. So 8s are left as is. In other rows, the 5s are replaced by 2s, and 0s are replaced by 2s in certain positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0 or 5, replace it with 2. But in Example 1's first row, the 0s are not all replaced by 2s. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in rows where the original value is 0, replace with 2 if the cell is in a column that is even.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 2s in certain columns.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make a hypothesis. Let's think of the following: the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a row that has a 2 in the same row. For example, in row 0 of Example 1, there are 2s in the input, so the 0s are replaced by 2s in certain positions. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a row that has a 2 in the same row. For example, in row 0 of Example 1, the input has 2s in the first few columns. So the 0s are replaced by 2s in those positions.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a column that is even or odd. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that can explain both examples.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row has 2s in positions 1,2,6,7,10,11. These are positions where the original value was 0 or 5. So maybe the 2s are being added where the original value is 0 or 5. But in the first row, the 0s are not all replaced by 2s. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 0 is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. The 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 0 or 5, and the 8s are kept. So maybe the 2s are being added where the original value is 0 or 5, but only in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAnother idea: the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 0 and the cell is in a certain column. For example, in row 0, columns 1,2,6,7,10,11. These are columns that are in the same row as the 2s. Maybe the 2s are being added in columns that are even or odd, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the column index is even or odd, but this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, in rows where the original value is 0, replace with 2 in certain columns.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, replace it with 2 if the cell is in a column that is even or odd, based on the row's index.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the row's index. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 2s in even columns, and in odd rows, replace 0s with 2s in odd columns.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in positions where the column is even, but this would not explain the first example's output.\n\nGiven the time I have, I think I need to proceed with a possible solution based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output for the first row has 2s in columns 1,2,6,7,10,11. These are columns that are 1-2, 6-7, 10-11. These are columns that are 5 apart. So perhaps the pattern is to replace 0s with 2s in positions that are 5 apart.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the column is in a certain range. For example, in row 0, columns 1-2, then 6-7, then 10-11. These ranges are 5 columns apart.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output for each row is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the original row's pattern. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the original row has 0s and 8s. The output replaces the 0s with 2s in certain positions. Maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are between the 8s.\n\nBut in the first row, the 8s are in positions 4 and 9. So between them, the 0s are replaced by 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 0 and the cell is between 8s.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, in rows where the original value is 0, replace with 2s in certain columns, and 5s are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain column, like columns 1, 2, 6, 7, 10, 11, etc.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in positions where the column index is even or odd, based on the row's index.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with a possible solution that replaces 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s, and 8s are left as is. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s if the cell is in a row that has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the code would look like this: for each cell, if the value is 0, replace it with 2 if there is a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut this would not explain the first example's output.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n    for each column in the row:\n        if grid[row][col] is 0:\n            if there is a 2 in the same row:\n                replace with 2\n        elif grid[row][col] is 5:\n            replace with 2\n        else:\n            leave as is\n\nBut this would not explain the first example's output, because in the first row of example 1, there are 2s in the input, so the 0s would be replaced with 2s. But in the first row of example 1, the output has 0s in some positions. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for row 0 is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. This can be seen as a pattern where the 2s are in positions that are even columns, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in positions where the column is even, but this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in positions where the column is even or odd, based on the row's index.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output of Example 1 and 2.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for row 0 has 2s in positions 1,2,6,7,10,11. These are columns that are 1-2, 6-7, 10-11. These are positions where the column index is 1-2, then 6-7, then 10-11. These are positions that are 5 apart. So maybe the pattern is to replace 0s with 2s in positions that are 5 apart.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each row, the 2s are placed in positions that are 5 apart. For example, in row 0, the 2s are in columns 1-2, then 6-7 (5 apart from 1), then 10-11 (5 apart from 6).\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each row, the 2s are placed in positions that are 5 apart. But how to determine which rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of a possible transformation that can explain both examples. Let's assume that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the row's index.\n\nFor example, in even rows, replace 0s with 2s in columns that are even, and in odd rows, replace 0s with 2s in columns that are odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, in rows where the original value is 0, replace with 2s in certain columns.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with a possible code that replaces 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s. For example, in the first example, the 5s are replaced with 2s, and the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the code is:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(14)]\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Replace with 2 if certain conditions are met\n                # For example, if the row is even and column is odd\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. In Example 1, the first row is even (i=0), so j=1 and j=2 would be replaced with 2. But in the first row of Example 1, the output has 2s in j=1, 2, 6, 7, 10, 11. So this code would only replace j=1 and 2, but not the others. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the code replaces 0s with 2s in positions where the column is even or odd based on the row's index. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 2s in even columns, and in odd rows, replace 0s with 2s in odd columns.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code replaces 0s with 2s in positions where the column is even, but this would not explain the first example's output.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to determine the exact pattern, I think I need to make a best guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for row 0 has 2s in columns 1,2,6,7,10,11. These columns are 1-2, 6-7, 10-11. These are positions where the column index is 1,2,6,7,10,11. These are columns that are 1-2, then 6-7 (which is 5 columns after 1), then 10-11 (5 columns after 6). So perhaps the pattern is to replace 0s with 2s in positions that are 5 apart.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nMaybe the code is to replace 0s with 2s in positions where the column is in the range 1-2, 6-7, 10-11, etc. But this is not scalable.\n\nAlternatively, the code replaces 0s with 2s in positions where the column is even, but this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with a code that replaces 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s. For example, in the first example, the 5s are replaced with 2s, and the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions.\n\nMaybe the code is to replace 0s with 2s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, or something like that.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the row's index. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 2s in columns that are even, and in odd rows, replace 0s with 2s in columns that are odd. This is a guess, but it might explain some of the examples.\n\nBut this is just a guess. I'll write the code based on this hypothesis.\n\nHowever, this might not work for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nThe input has rows with numbers like 0, 2, 2, 0, 8, etc. The output seems to have some patterns where certain numbers are repeated. For instance, in the first input row, the output is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So it looks like the 2s are being spread out in a way. Also, there's a 5 in the input that's replaced by 2s in the output. Wait, maybe the 5s are being replaced by 2s? Or maybe there's a pattern based on the positions of certain numbers.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row of input is 0 0 0 0 8 0 5 5 0 8 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 5s in the input are replaced by 2s. Also, the 8s are kept as 8s. But why are the 2s appearing in certain positions?\n\nAnother observation: in the input, there are some rows that have 8s in all positions. For example, the fifth row in Example 1's input is all 8s. The output for that row is also all 8s. So maybe that's a case where the 8s are left as is. But other rows have different patterns.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has rows with 3s, 4s, 2s, 8s, etc. The output seems to have similar patterns. For example, in the first input row of Example 2, the output is the same as the input. But in the second row, the input is 0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0, and the output is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the 4s are being spread out, and the 3s are kept. But there's also a 3 in the input that's replaced by a 4 in some positions. Wait, maybe the 4s are being extended in certain positions.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are being replaced based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are being replaced by 2s. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look at the positions where the numbers change. For instance, in Example 1, the input has a row with 0 2 2 0 8 0 5 5 0 8 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 5s in the input are replaced by 2s. But why? Maybe the 5s are in positions where the original numbers are 5, and they are being replaced by 2s. But then, in the third row of Example 1's input, the input is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0, and the output is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. So here, the 5s are replaced by 2s, but also the 0s are being replaced by 2s in some positions. Wait, maybe the 2s are being spread out in certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced by 2s, and the 0s are being replaced by 2s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. For instance, the first input row is all 0s and 3s. The output is the same as the input. But the second input row has 0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the 4s are being spread out. The 3s are kept. So maybe the 4s are being expanded in certain positions. But how?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell has a certain value, it's replaced by another value based on some rule. But I need to find a pattern that applies across the examples.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row of input has 0s and 8s. The output has 2s in positions where the input had 0s and 8s. Wait, maybe not. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input row: 0 0 0 0 8 0 5 5 0 8 0 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0\n\nSo the 0s in positions 0,1,2,3,5,8,11,12,13 are being replaced by 2s in positions 1,2, etc. Maybe the 0s are being replaced by 2s in certain positions based on their neighbors. For example, the 0s that are between 2s or 8s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that if a cell is 0, it's replaced by 2 if the cell is in a certain position. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the third row of input is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced by 2s, and the 5s are replaced by 2s. But why? Maybe the 0s are being replaced by 2s if there's a 2 in the same row or column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being spread out in certain patterns. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in positions where the input had 0s and 5s. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nIn Example 2, the first input row is 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output is the same as the input. So maybe that's a case where the 3s are left as is. But then in the second input row, the 4s are spread out. So perhaps the 4s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions. But why?\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for the fifth row (all 8s) is the same as the input. So 8s are left as is. In other rows, the 8s are kept. But in other rows, the 5s are replaced by 2s. So maybe the 5s are being replaced by 2s, and the 0s are being replaced by 2s in certain positions. But how to determine that.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 0, it's replaced by 2 if the cell is in a certain position. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, then it's replaced by 2 if the cell is in a certain row or column. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output differs from the input. For example, in Example 1, the first input row has 0s and 8s, and the output has 2s in certain positions. Maybe the 2s are being added where there's a 0 and a 5 in the input. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in the first example, the 5s are replaced by 2s. But why?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the third row of input is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced by 2s, and the 5s are replaced by 2s. So maybe any cell that is 0 or 5 is replaced by 2. But that's not the case in the first row of input. In the first row of input, the 5s are replaced by 2s, but the 0s are not replaced by 2s. Wait, in the first input row, the 0s are in positions 0,1,2,3,5,8,11,12,13. The output has 2s in positions 1,2, etc. For example, the first input row's output is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 0s in positions 0,3,5,8,11,12,13 are kept as 0, but the 0s in positions 1,2, etc. are replaced by 2s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced by 2s if they are between certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in certain patterns. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in positions where the input had 0s and 5s. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the 2s are placed in positions where the original cell is 0 and the cell is in a certain column. For example, in the first row of input, the 0s are in columns 0,1,2,3,5,8, etc. The output has 2s in columns 1,2, etc. So maybe the 2s are being placed in positions that are even or odd, or based on some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain position. For example, in the first example, the output's first row has 2s in columns 1,2, etc. Maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original cell is 0 and the row is even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row of output has 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 2s are in positions 1,2,6,7,10,11, etc. Maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the column is even or odd. Wait, columns are 0-based. So columns 1 and 2 are even? Or maybe it's based on the row.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 0 (first row) has 2s in columns 1,2,6,7,10,11. These columns are 1-2 (positions 1 and 2), then 6-7 (columns 6 and 7), then 10-11 (columns 10 and 11). So this seems like a pattern where 2s are placed in pairs in certain positions. Similarly, in row 2 of Example 1's output, the row is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. So all the 0s are replaced by 2s, and the 8s are kept.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain row or column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the 2s are placed in positions where the original cell is 0 and the row is even. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original cell is 0 and the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in positions that are even columns. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain position. For example, in the first example, the output for row 0 has 2s in columns 1,2,6,7,10,11. These are columns where the original input had 0s. But why those columns?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the 2s are being added in a way that forms horizontal lines. For example, in row 0 of Example 1, the 2s are in positions 1-2, then 6-7, then 10-11. This could be a pattern of horizontal lines. Similarly, in row 2 of Example 1, the entire row is filled with 2s except for the 8s. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 0s are replaced by 2s, but in others, they are not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value. For example, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain row or column. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 2, in the second row, the input is 0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the 4s are being spread out in certain positions. For example, the 4s are in positions 0,1,3,5,6,7, etc. So maybe the 4s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe the transformation is that if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is even (like row 0, 2, 4, etc.), then replace 0s with 2s in certain positions. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if a cell is 0 and the cell to the left is 2, then replace it with 2. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the third row of input is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced by 2s, and the 5s are replaced by 2s. So maybe any cell that is 0 or 5 is replaced by 2. But in the first row of input, the 5s are replaced by 2s, but the 0s are not replaced by 2s. Wait, in the first row of input, the 0s are in positions 0,1,2,3,5,8,11,12,13. The output has 0s in positions 0,3,5,8,11,12,13, but 2s in positions 1,2,6,7,10,11. So maybe the 0s are replaced by 2s if they are between certain values. For example, if there's a 2 in the same row, then the 0 is replaced by 2. But that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain column. For example, columns 1,2,6,7,10,11 in row 0 of Example 1. These columns are 1 and 2 (positions 1 and 2), then 6 and 7 (positions 6 and 7), then 10 and 11 (positions 10 and 11). So these are positions that are even or odd. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 2s are being added in positions that are even columns, but that's not the case for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the column index is even or odd. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 0 is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 2s are in positions that are even columns (1 and 2, 6 and 7, 10 and 11). Wait, columns are 0-based. So columns 1 and 2 are odd and even? Not sure. But the pattern is that the 2s are in pairs of columns. Like, positions 1-2, 6-7, 10-11. These are positions that are spaced 5 apart. For example, 1 and 2, then 6 and 7 (which is 5 more than 1), then 10 and 11 (5 more than 6). So perhaps the pattern is that in each row, the 2s are placed in pairs of columns that are 5 apart. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 2s are being added in positions that are in certain columns based on the row's position. For example, in even rows, the 2s are placed in certain columns.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should try to think of a general rule that can be applied to both examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, for the second row, the input is 0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the 4s are being spread out in certain positions. The original 4s are in positions 1 and 2, then 0 is replaced by 4, then 3 is replaced by 4, etc. So maybe the 4s are being spread out in a way that creates a pattern of 4s in certain positions.\n\nAnother idea: the output for each cell is determined by the original cell's value and the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the original cell is 0 and there's a 2 in the same row, then replace it with 2. But this might not hold for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain row or column. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in positions where the original cell is 0 and the row is even. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the row's index. For example, in rows where the row index is even, replace 0s with 2s in certain columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where the output differs from the input. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 0 has 2s in certain positions where the input was 0 or 5. But in other rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added where the original value is 0 and the cell is in a certain column. For example, columns that are even or odd.\n\nBut this is not leading me anywhere. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing certain values with others and applying some pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 0 has 2s in positions that are even columns. For example, columns 1 and 2 are 1 and 2 (odd and even). Wait, no. Maybe the pattern is that the 2s are placed in positions where the column index is even. But in row 0, the 2s are in columns 1, 2, 6, 7, 10, 11. These are odd and even columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the column index is divisible by 2. But 1 is not divisible by 2. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the column index is not divisible by 4. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a row that is even or odd. For example, in row 0, which is even, replace 0s with 2s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the value of the original cell and the row. For example, in rows where the original value is 0, replace it with 2 if the row is even.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the third row of input is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced by 2s, and the 5s are replaced by 2s. So maybe any cell that is 0 or 5 is replaced by 2. But in the first row of input, the 5s are replaced by 2s, but the 0s are not replaced by 2s in all positions. For example, in the first row of input, the 0s are in positions 0,1,2,3,5,8,11,12,13. The output has 0s in positions 0,3,5,8,11,12,13, but 2s in positions 1,2,6,7,10,11. So maybe the 0s are replaced by 2s only if there's a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a row that has a 2 in the same row. For example, in row 0 of Example 1, there are 2s in the input. So the 0s in positions 1 and 2 are replaced by 2s. But the 0s in positions 0,3,5,8, etc. are not replaced by 2s.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain column. For example, columns 1,2,6,7,10,11 in row 0.\n\nBut this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 2s are being added in positions where the original cell is 0 and the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in rows where the original value is 0, replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain position.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother approach: look for the output in Example 2. In the second row of input, the output is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the 4s are being spread out in certain positions. The original input has 4s in positions 1 and 2, and 0s elsewhere. The output has 4s in positions 0,1,3,5,6,7, etc. So it seems like the 4s are being expanded to fill certain positions.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with the value of the cell to the left or right, or based on some other rule.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a row that has a certain pattern. For example, in rows where the original value is 0, replace with 2 if the row is even.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that can explain both examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for rows with 0s and 5s are replaced by 2s. For example, the 5s are replaced by 2s, and the 0s are replaced by 2s in certain positions. In Example 2, the 3s are kept, and the 4s are replaced by 4s in certain positions. So perhaps the transformation is that certain values are replaced by others, and the replacement is based on the original value and the position.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for rows that have 8s in all positions are unchanged. So 8s are left as is. In other rows, the 5s are replaced by 2s, and 0s are replaced by 2s in certain positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0 or 5, replace it with 2. But in Example 1's first row, the 0s are not all replaced by 2s. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in rows where the original value is 0, replace with 2 if the cell is in a column that is even.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 2s in certain columns.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make a hypothesis. Let's think of the following: the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a row that has a 2 in the same row. For example, in row 0 of Example 1, there are 2s in the input, so the 0s are replaced by 2s in certain positions. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a row that has a 2 in the same row. For example, in row 0 of Example 1, the input has 2s in the first few columns. So the 0s are replaced by 2s in those positions.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, then replace it with 2 if the cell is in a column that is even or odd. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that can explain both examples.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row has 2s in positions 1,2,6,7,10,11. These are positions where the original value was 0 or 5. So maybe the 2s are being added where the original value is 0 or 5. But in the first row, the 0s are not all replaced by 2s. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 0 is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. The 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 0 or 5, and the 8s are kept. So maybe the 2s are being added where the original value is 0 or 5, but only in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAnother idea: the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 0 and the cell is in a certain column. For example, in row 0, columns 1,2,6,7,10,11. These are columns that are in the same row as the 2s. Maybe the 2s are being added in columns that are even or odd, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the column index is even or odd, but this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, in rows where the original value is 0, replace with 2 in certain columns.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each cell, if the original value is 0, replace it with 2 if the cell is in a column that is even or odd, based on the row's index.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the row's index. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 2s in even columns, and in odd rows, replace 0s with 2s in odd columns.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in positions where the column is even, but this would not explain the first example's output.\n\nGiven the time I have, I think I need to proceed with a possible solution based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output for the first row has 2s in columns 1,2,6,7,10,11. These are columns that are 1-2, 6-7, 10-11. These are columns that are 5 apart. So perhaps the pattern is to replace 0s with 2s in positions that are 5 apart.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the column is in a certain range. For example, in row 0, columns 1-2, then 6-7, then 10-11. These ranges are 5 columns apart.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output for each row is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the original row's pattern. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the original row has 0s and 8s. The output replaces the 0s with 2s in certain positions. Maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are between the 8s.\n\nBut in the first row, the 8s are in positions 4 and 9. So between them, the 0s are replaced by 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 0 and the cell is between 8s.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, in rows where the original value is 0, replace with 2s in certain columns, and 5s are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain column, like columns 1, 2, 6, 7, 10, 11, etc.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in positions where the column index is even or odd, based on the row's index.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with a possible solution that replaces 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s, and 8s are left as is. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s if the cell is in a row that has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the code would look like this: for each cell, if the value is 0, replace it with 2 if there is a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut this would not explain the first example's output.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n    for each column in the row:\n        if grid[row][col] is 0:\n            if there is a 2 in the same row:\n                replace with 2\n        elif grid[row][col] is 5:\n            replace with 2\n        else:\n            leave as is\n\nBut this would not explain the first example's output, because in the first row of example 1, there are 2s in the input, so the 0s would be replaced with 2s. But in the first row of example 1, the output has 0s in some positions. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for row 0 is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. This can be seen as a pattern where the 2s are in positions that are even columns, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in positions where the column is even, but this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in positions where the column is even or odd, based on the row's index.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output of Example 1 and 2.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for row 0 has 2s in positions 1,2,6,7,10,11. These are columns that are 1-2, 6-7, 10-11. These are positions where the column index is 1-2, then 6-7, then 10-11. These are positions that are 5 apart. So maybe the pattern is to replace 0s with 2s in positions that are 5 apart.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each row, the 2s are placed in positions that are 5 apart. For example, in row 0, the 2s are in columns 1-2, then 6-7 (5 apart from 1), then 10-11 (5 apart from 6).\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each row, the 2s are placed in positions that are 5 apart. But how to determine which rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of a possible transformation that can explain both examples. Let's assume that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the row's index.\n\nFor example, in even rows, replace 0s with 2s in columns that are even, and in odd rows, replace 0s with 2s in columns that are odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, in rows where the original value is 0, replace with 2s in certain columns.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with a possible code that replaces 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s. For example, in the first example, the 5s are replaced with 2s, and the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the code is:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(14)]\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Replace with 2 if certain conditions are met\n                # For example, if the row is even and column is odd\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. In Example 1, the first row is even (i=0), so j=1 and j=2 would be replaced with 2. But in the first row of Example 1, the output has 2s in j=1, 2, 6, 7, 10, 11. So this code would only replace j=1 and 2, but not the others. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the code replaces 0s with 2s in positions where the column is even or odd based on the row's index. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 2s in even columns, and in odd rows, replace 0s with 2s in odd columns.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code replaces 0s with 2s in positions where the column is even, but this would not explain the first example's output.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to determine the exact pattern, I think I need to make a best guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for row 0 has 2s in columns 1,2,6,7,10,11. These columns are 1-2, 6-7, 10-11. These are positions where the column index is 1,2,6,7,10,11. These are columns that are 1-2, then 6-7 (which is 5 columns after 1), then 10-11 (5 columns after 6). So perhaps the pattern is to replace 0s with 2s in positions that are 5 apart.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nMaybe the code is to replace 0s with 2s in positions where the column is in the range 1-2, 6-7, 10-11, etc. But this is not scalable.\n\nAlternatively, the code replaces 0s with 2s in positions where the column is even, but this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with a code that replaces 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s. For example, in the first example, the 5s are replaced with 2s, and the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions.\n\nMaybe the code is to replace 0s with 2s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, or something like that.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the row's index. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 2s in columns that are even, and in odd rows, replace 0s with 2s in columns that are odd. This is a guess, but it might explain some of the examples.\n\nBut this is just a guess. I'll write the code based on this hypothesis.\n\nHowever, this might not work for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n"
