          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 3 in the third row, third column (row 2, column 2 if 0-based). The output has an 8 in the first row, second column, and a 3 in the first row, eighth column. Wait, maybe there's some kind of symmetry or transformation applied. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1:\n\nInput's third row is 0 0 3 0 0 6 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the 3 in the input's third row, third column becomes 8 in the output's third row, third column? Wait no, the output's third row is 0 0 8 ... so the third column is 8. But the input's third row, third column was 3. So maybe there's a transformation where certain positions are replaced with other numbers based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their row and column. For example, maybe the output is a rotated version of the input? But looking at the first example's input and output, the input has a 3 in position (2,2) (third row, third column), and the output has 8 there. But in the output's first row, there's an 8 in column 1 (second column). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the outputs. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0. The input's first row is all zeros. So maybe some positions are being filled with numbers based on their position. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the third row's third column is 8. The input's third row's third column is 3. Maybe there's a transformation where certain cells are replaced based on their position. Like, for example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input and some other pattern. Let me check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has some 6s and 0s. The output has various numbers. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their row and column. For example, in the output of Example 2, there's a 3 in the first row, fifth column. The input's first row is all zeros except for the 6 in the first row, first column? Wait, the input for Example 2 is a 12x12 grid? Wait no, the input for Example 2 is a 12x12 grid? Wait, the input for example 2 is written as:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n... etc. So each line is 12 numbers. But the output is 12x12 as well. Wait, but the test input is 8x8? Wait, the test input is given as 8 rows of 8 numbers each. But the training examples have different sizes. Wait, the problem says that the input is a 9x9 grid. Wait, but in the examples, the first example has 9 rows of 9 numbers each. The second example has 12 rows of 12 numbers each. Wait, that's conflicting. Oh, maybe the examples are not all 9x9. Wait, the problem says that the test input is 8x8. But the training examples have varying sizes. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the examples are not all 9x9. But the user says that the test input is 8x8. But the problem says that the transformation must produce a 9x9 output. Wait, perhaps the training examples are not 9x9. But the problem says that the test input is 8x8. That's confusing. Wait, maybe the training examples are not 9x9. Maybe the problem is that the examples are different sizes. But the user says that the test input is 8x8. But the problem says that the transformation must always produce a 9x9 output. So perhaps the test input is 8x8, but the output is 9x9. But that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the examples are not all 9x9. Maybe the examples are different sizes, but the test input is 8x8, and the output must be 9x9. That seems odd. But perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the examples are 9x9. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: it's 9 rows, each with 9 numbers. The output is 9 rows of 9 numbers. So that's 9x9. Example 2's input is 12 rows of 12 numbers. But that's conflicting with the problem's requirement that the output is 9x9. But the user says that the test input is 8x8. So perhaps the problem is that the training examples are not 9x9. But the user says that the transformation must always produce a 9x9 output. So perhaps the test input is 8x8, but the output is 9x9. That's confusing. But maybe the examples are different. However, the user says that the test input is 8x8, but the output is 9x9. But that's not possible. So perhaps the examples are not all 9x9. Maybe the problem is that the examples are different sizes, but the code must handle any input and output as per the problem's instruction. But the problem says that the function must return a 9x9 grid. So perhaps the test input is 8x8, but the output is 9x9. But that's not possible. So maybe the examples are not 9x9. Maybe the problem is that the training examples are 9x9, and the test input is 8x8. But that's conflicting. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the test input is 8x8, but the code is supposed to process that and output a 9x9 grid. That seems impossible. But perhaps the examples are not 9x9. Maybe the problem is that the user made a mistake. But given the problem statement, perhaps the code must process any input and output a 9x9 grid. But that's unclear. However, the user says that the function must return a 9x9 grid. So regardless of the input size, the output is 9x9. But the training examples have different sizes. So maybe the examples are not 9x9. But the user says that the test input is 8x8. So perhaps the code must process any input (like 8x8, 9x9, etc.) and output a 9x9 grid. But that's not clear. However, the problem says that the function takes a 2D list (grid) and returns a 9x9 grid. So regardless of the input size, the output is 9x9. But the examples may have different input sizes. For example, Example 1's input is 9x9, output is 9x9. Example 2's input is 12x12, output is 12x12. But the user says that the test input is 8x8, but the output must be 9x9. That's conflicting. But perhaps the examples are not all 9x9. But the user's problem says that the code must return a 9x9 grid. So the function must take any input (like 8x8, 9x9, etc.) and return a 9x9 grid. But that's not possible. So perhaps the examples are all 9x9. But in Example 2, the input is 12x12. That's conflicting.\n\nThis is confusing. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the examples. Alternatively, maybe the examples are not 9x9. But given the problem statement, I need to proceed. Let's focus on the first example. The input is 9x9, output is 9x9. So for the code, the input can be of any size, but the output is 9x9. But that's not possible. Wait, the problem says that the function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value. So the input can be any size. But the output must be 9x9. So the code must process any input and return a 9x9 grid. But how? For example, the test input is 8x8, but the output is 9x9. So perhaps the code is supposed to take the input and generate a 9x9 output based on some pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are all 9x9. But Example 2's input is 12x12. That's conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake in the examples. But given that the test input is 8x8, and the output is 9x9, perhaps the code is supposed to take an input grid and generate a 9x9 output. So the code must process the input and generate a 9x9 grid. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are not 9x9. Maybe the problem is that the user has a mistake in the examples. But given that the user provided the examples, I have to work with them. Let me try to find a pattern between the first example's input and output.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: all zeros.\nRow 1: all zeros.\nRow 2: 0 0 3 0 0 6 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 8 0 0 7 0 0 0\nRow 6: all zeros.\nRow 7: all zeros.\nRow 8: all zeros.\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\nRow 1: 0 8 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 7 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 7: 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\n\nLooking at the input and output, the third row in the input has a 3 in position (2,2). In the output, the third row has an 8 in position (2,2). Also, the fifth row in the input has an 8 in position (5,2). In the output, the fifth row has a 7 in position (5,2). Hmm. Not sure.\n\nLooking at the output's first row, there's an 8 in position (0,0) and a 3 in position (0,7). The input's first row is all zeros. So maybe those positions are being filled with numbers based on their position. For example, maybe positions (0,0) and (0,7) are being set to 8 and 3, respectively. But how?\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 1, the third row has 8 in position (2,2). The input's third row has 3 there. So maybe there's a transformation where certain positions are replaced with specific numbers based on their row and column. For example, maybe positions where the row is even and column is even are being replaced with 8, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are based on some pattern like the sum of the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input and some transformation. For example, in the output, the third row's third column is 8. The input's third row's third column is 3. So 3 becomes 8. But why?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row has 8 in column 0. The input's first row is all zeros. So maybe the 8 is a fixed value. Similarly, the output's first row has 3 in column 7. Maybe that's a fixed value. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotation or reflection of the input. For example, maybe the output is the input rotated 90 degrees. But in Example 1, the input's third row is 0 0 3 0 0 6 0 0 0. Rotating 90 degrees would make it a column in the output. But the output's third row is 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their position. For example, in the output, the first row has 8 at (0,0) and 3 at (0,7). Maybe those positions are being set to 8 and 3 based on their position. Similarly, in the second row of the output, there's an 8 at (1,1) and 3 at (1,7). So maybe for rows 0 and 1, the first column is 8 and the seventh column is 3. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells with specific values based on their row and column. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, then some function of i and j is used to determine the value. For example, if i is even, then set to 8, else 3. But that doesn't fit all cases.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the outputs of the examples. For example, in Example 1's output, the third row has 8 in column 2. The input's third row had 3 there. So maybe the transformation is replacing certain positions with specific numbers. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row has 8 in column 0 and 3 in column 7. The second row has 8 in column 1 and 3 in column 7. The third row has 8 in column 2 and 3 in column 7. Wait, the third row of the output is 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0. So column 2 is 8, column 6 is 3? Or column 7? Let me check:\n\nRow 2 of output is [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. So column 2 is 8, column 5 is 3. So maybe for each row i, the value at column i is 8, and column 5 is 3? But that doesn't fit for other rows. For example, row 0 of output has 8 at column 0 and 3 at column 7. Row 1 has 8 at column 1 and 3 at column 7. Row 2 has 8 at column 2 and 3 at column 5. Hmm, that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 and 3 are placed in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in row i, column i is set to 8, and column 7 is set to 3. But in row 2, column 7 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions with specific values. For example, the positions where the row is 0, column is 0 is 8, row 0 column 7 is 3. Row 1, column 1 is 8, row 1 column 7 is 3. Row 2, column 2 is 8, row 2 column 5 is 3. But that seems arbitrary. Maybe there's a pattern where for row i, column i is 8, and column 5 is 3. But that doesn't fit for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input and some other pattern. For example, in the input, the third row has a 3 in column 2. In the output, that position is 8. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their position.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me look at other examples.\n\nExample 2's input and output:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 7 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 7\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\nRow 7: 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 8\nRow 8: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 7 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 8 0 8\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 2 0 8 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 2 8 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 8 6 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 8 3 0 6 6\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 7 0 8 0 0 2 2 6\nRow 6: 7 0 0 7 0 8 0 0 0 2 2 0\nRow 7: 0 7 7 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 7\nRow 8: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 2 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 6 0 0 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 6 0 0 0 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLooking at the output for row 0, there's a 3 in column 4, and 3 in column 6. The input for row 0 has 8 in column 6. So maybe some transformation is happening here. For example, the 8 in column 6 becomes 3. But why?\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 2, row 6 has 7 in column 0. The input for row 6 is all zeros. So perhaps certain positions are being filled with specific values. For example, row 6, column 0 is 7. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions with specific values based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns are filled with 8 or 3. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by applying some kind of transformation to the input, such as swapping certain positions or adding values. For example, in Example 1, the third row's third column is 3, and the output has 8 there. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced with 8 or 3 based on their position.\n\nBut how to find a general rule?\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the outputs. For example, in the first example's output, the third row has 8 in column 2 and 3 in column 5. In the second example's output, row 0 has 3 in column 4 and 6. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with 3 or 8 based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their row and column indices. For example, for cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 8, if j is even, set to 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where certain positions are filled with numbers based on the input. For example, if the input has a 3 in a certain position, the output has 8 there. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input and some fixed pattern. For example, in the first example, the output's first row has 8 and 3 in certain positions, which may be fixed. But how?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells with specific values based on their position. For example, for cell (i,j), if i + j is even, set to 8, else 3. But let's test this with the first example.\n\nIn the first example's output, the first row (i=0) has 8 at (0,0) (i+j=0, even) and 3 at (0,7) (i+j=7, odd). That fits. For row 1, (i=1, j=1) is 8 (i+j=2, even). (i=1, j=7) is 3 (i+j=8, even). Wait, that doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some other rule. For example, for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 8 if j is even, else 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions with specific values based on their row and column. For example, in the first example's output, the third row has 8 in column 2 (i=2, j=2), and 3 in column 5 (i=2, j=5). So maybe for row i, column j is set to 8 if j = i, and 3 if j = 5. But this is not consistent with other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are filled with 8 or 3 based on their position. For example, in the first example's output, the first row has 8 in column 0 and 3 in column 7. The second row has 8 in column 1 and 3 in column 7. The third row has 8 in column 2 and 3 in column 5. The fourth row has 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0. So maybe the 3 is in column 5 for row 2, but not for row 3. This is not consistent.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look at the test input and see what it might transform into.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0\n7 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n8 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output should be 9x9. But the test input is 8x8. So the code must take this input and produce a 9x9 output. But how?\n\nMaybe the code is supposed to pad the input with zeros to make it 9x9. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, the code is supposed to apply some transformation based on the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is supposed to replace certain positions based on their position. For example, the test input has a 3 in position (0,2), and the output's first row has 8 in (0,0) and 3 in (0,7). But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to replace certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their row and column. For example, in the first example, the output has 8 in (i,j) where i = j, and 3 in (i, 7 - i). But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example's output, the first row has 8 in (0,0) and 3 in (0,7). The second row has 8 in (1,1) and 3 in (1,7). The third row has 8 in (2,2) and 3 in (2,5). The fourth row has 2 2 in positions (3,3) and (3,4). So perhaps for rows 0-2, the 8 is in (i,i), and the 3 is in (i, 7 - i) for rows 0 and 1, but not for row 2. This is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is supposed to replace certain cells with values based on some pattern. For example, for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 8 if j is even, else 3. But this is not working for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to replace certain cells based on their position in the grid. For example, the output is a 9x9 grid where the first row has 8 in column 0 and 3 in column 7, and the second row has 8 in column 1 and 3 in column 7, and so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for other clues. For example, in Example 1's output, the fifth row has 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0 0. The input's fifth row is 0 0 8 0 0 7 0 0 0. So the 8 in the input's fifth row, third column becomes 7 in the output. So maybe there's a transformation where certain positions are replaced with specific values based on their position.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the outputs of all examples. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 8 in column 2 and 3 in column 5. In Example 2, the output's row 0 has 3 in column 4 and 6. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with 3 or 8 based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions with values based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns are filled with 8 or 3. But without more data, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation involves replacing certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their row and column indices. For example, for each cell (i,j), if i + j is even, set to 8, else set to 3. But let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the third row (i=2) has 3 in column 2 (j=2). i + j = 4, even. So according to this hypothesis, the output would have 8 in that position. Which matches the first example's output. For the first row (i=0), column 0 (j=0): i+j=0, even \u2192 8. Column 7 (j=7): i+j=7, odd \u2192 3. Which matches the output. For row 1, column 1 (i=1, j=1): 2 \u2192 even \u2192 8. Column 7: 1+7=8 even \u2192 8? But in the output, row 1 has 8 in column 1 and 3 in column 7. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nWait, the output for row 1 has 8 in column 1 and 3 in column 7. i=1, j=1: i+j=2 even \u2192 8. j=7: i+j=8 even \u2192 8. But the output has 3 there. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, then set to 8 in column i, and 3 in column 7-i. For row 0, column 0 is 8, column 7 is 3. For row 1, column 1 is 8, column 7 is 3. For row 2, column 2 is 8, column 5 is 3. But why column 5? 7 - 2 is 5. So this seems to fit. For row 2, j=5 is 7 - i = 7-2=5. So for row i, column i is 8, and column 7 - i is 3. But what about row 3? In the first example's output, row 3 is 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0. So column 3 is 2, column 4 is 2. So this doesn't fit the pattern. So this hypothesis is only valid for rows 0, 1, 2.\n\nBut in the first example's output, row 5 has 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0 0. So for row 5, column 2 is 7, column 5 is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows 0-2, the output has 8 in column i and 3 in column 7 - i. For other rows, it's different.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll try to implement this hypothesis and see if it fits the examples.\n\nSo the code would replace certain positions with 8 and 3 based on their row and column. For example, for each row i in 0-2, set cell (i,i) to 8 and cell (i, 7 - i) to 3. For other rows, leave as is. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to handle the other rows? For example, in the first example's output, row 3 is 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0. So the 2 2 are in columns 3 and 4. Maybe those are from the input's row 3, which had 2 2 in columns 3 and 4. So perhaps those are unchanged.\n\nBut in the first example's output, row 5 has 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0 0. The input's row 5 was 0 0 8 0 0 7 0 0 0. So the 8 in column 2 is replaced with 7, and the 7 in column 5 is kept as 6? Or maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each cell (i,j), if i is in 0-2, then set to 8 if j == i, and 3 if j == 7 - i. For other rows, leave as is. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut the test input is 8x8, so this would not apply. However, the code needs to handle any input and output 9x9. So perhaps the code is supposed to replace certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their row and column. For example, for each cell (i,j), if i is even, set to 8 if j is even, else 3. But this is not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the code may be replacing certain positions with specific values based on their row and column. For example, in the first example's output, the first three rows have 8 in column i and 3 in column 7 - i. For the test input, which is 8x8, perhaps the code is supposed to replace certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their row and column.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell (i,j) in the output grid, if i is in 0-2, then set to 8 if j == i, else 3 if j == 7 - i. Otherwise, leave as is. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut this would not handle the other examples. For example, in Example 2, the output has 3 in column 4 of row 0, which would fit the pattern if i=0, j=4 = 7 - i = 7-0=7, which is not 4. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the code is replacing certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their row and column. For example, in the first example, the output's first row has 8 in (0,0) and 3 in (0,7). The second row has 8 in (1,1) and 3 in (1,7). The third row has 8 in (2,2) and 3 in (2,5). So for row i, j = i is 8, and j = 5 is 3. But why 5? For row 2, 7 - i is 5. So for row i, j = i is 8, j = 7 - i is 3. But for row 2, j=5 is 7 - i = 5. So this fits. For row 0, j=7 is 7 - 0 =7. For row 1, j=6 is 7-1=6, but the output has 3 in column 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell (i,j) in the output grid, if i is in 0-2, then set to 8 if j == i, else 3 if j == 7 - i. For other rows, leave as is. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut the test input is 8x8, so the code would need to handle that. However, the code is supposed to return a 9x9 grid. So perhaps the code is supposed to replace certain positions based on their row and column in the input grid. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to replace certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their position in the input grid. For example, if the input has a 3 in a certain position, the output has 8 there. But how to determine that.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell in the output grid, if the row is 0-2, then set to 8 if column equals row, else 3 if column equals 7 - row. For other rows, leave as is. This would handle the first example, but not the others. But this is the best I can do given the time.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 3 in the third row, third column (row 2, column 2 if 0-based). The output has an 8 in the first row, second column, and a 3 in the first row, eighth column. Wait, maybe there's some kind of symmetry or transformation applied. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1:\n\nInput's third row is 0 0 3 0 0 6 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the 3 in the input's third row, third column becomes 8 in the output's third row, third column? Wait no, the output's third row is 0 0 8 ... so the third column is 8. But the input's third row, third column was 3. So maybe there's a transformation where certain positions are replaced with other numbers based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their row and column. For example, maybe the output is a rotated version of the input? But looking at the first example's input and output, the input has a 3 in position (2,2) (third row, third column), and the output has 8 there. But in the output's first row, there's an 8 in column 1 (second column). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the outputs. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0. The input's first row is all zeros. So maybe some positions are being filled with numbers based on their position. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the third row's third column is 8. The input's third row's third column is 3. Maybe there's a transformation where certain cells are replaced based on their position. Like, for example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input and some other pattern. Let me check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has some 6s and 0s. The output has various numbers. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their row and column. For example, in the output of Example 2, there's a 3 in the first row, fifth column. The input's first row is all zeros except for the 6 in the first row, first column? Wait, the input for Example 2 is a 12x12 grid? Wait no, the input for Example 2 is a 12x12 grid? Wait, the input for example 2 is written as:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n... etc. So each line is 12 numbers. But the output is 12x12 as well. Wait, but the test input is 8x8? Wait, the test input is given as 8 rows of 8 numbers each. But the training examples have different sizes. Wait, the problem says that the input is a 9x9 grid. Wait, but in the examples, the first example has 9 rows of 9 numbers each. The second example has 12 rows of 12 numbers each. Wait, that's conflicting. Oh, maybe the examples are not all 9x9. Wait, the problem says that the test input is 8x8. But the training examples have varying sizes. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the examples are not all 9x9. But the user says that the test input is 8x8. But the problem says that the transformation must produce a 9x9 output. Wait, perhaps the training examples are not 9x9. But the problem says that the test input is 8x8. That's confusing. Wait, maybe the training examples are not 9x9. Maybe the problem is that the examples are different sizes. But the user says that the test input is 8x8. But the problem says that the transformation must always produce a 9x9 output. So perhaps the test input is 8x8, but the output is 9x9. But that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the examples are not all 9x9. Maybe the examples are different sizes, but the test input is 8x8, and the output must be 9x9. That seems odd. But perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the examples are 9x9. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: it's 9 rows, each with 9 numbers. The output is 9 rows of 9 numbers. So that's 9x9. Example 2's input is 12 rows of 12 numbers. But that's conflicting with the problem's requirement that the output is 9x9. But the user says that the test input is 8x8. So perhaps the problem is that the training examples are not 9x9. But the user says that the transformation must always produce a 9x9 output. So perhaps the test input is 8x8, but the output is 9x9. That's confusing. But maybe the examples are different. However, the user says that the test input is 8x8, but the output is 9x9. But that's not possible. So perhaps the examples are not all 9x9. Maybe the problem is that the examples are different sizes, but the code must handle any input and output as per the problem's instruction. But the problem says that the function must return a 9x9 grid. So perhaps the test input is 8x8, but the output is 9x9. But that's not possible. So maybe the examples are not 9x9. Maybe the problem is that the training examples are 9x9, and the test input is 8x8. But that's conflicting. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the test input is 8x8, but the code is supposed to process that and output a 9x9 grid. That seems impossible. But perhaps the examples are not 9x9. Maybe the problem is that the user made a mistake. But given the problem statement, perhaps the code must process any input and output a 9x9 grid. But that's unclear. However, the user says that the function must return a 9x9 grid. So regardless of the input size, the output is 9x9. But the training examples have different sizes. So maybe the examples are not 9x9. But the user says that the test input is 8x8. So perhaps the code must process any input (like 8x8, 9x9, etc.) and output a 9x9 grid. But that's not clear. However, the problem says that the function takes a 2D list (grid) and returns a 9x9 grid. So regardless of the input size, the output is 9x9. But the examples may have different input sizes. For example, Example 1's input is 9x9, output is 9x9. Example 2's input is 12x12, output is 12x12. But the user says that the test input is 8x8, but the output must be 9x9. That's conflicting. But perhaps the examples are not all 9x9. But the user's problem says that the code must return a 9x9 grid. So the function must take any input (like 8x8, 9x9, etc.) and return a 9x9 grid. But that's not possible. So perhaps the examples are all 9x9. But in Example 2, the input is 12x12. That's conflicting.\n\nThis is confusing. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the examples. Alternatively, maybe the examples are not 9x9. But given the problem statement, I need to proceed. Let's focus on the first example. The input is 9x9, output is 9x9. So for the code, the input can be of any size, but the output is 9x9. But that's not possible. Wait, the problem says that the function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value. So the input can be any size. But the output must be 9x9. So the code must process any input and return a 9x9 grid. But how? For example, the test input is 8x8, but the output is 9x9. So perhaps the code is supposed to take the input and generate a 9x9 output based on some pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are all 9x9. But Example 2's input is 12x12. That's conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake in the examples. But given that the test input is 8x8, and the output is 9x9, perhaps the code is supposed to take an input grid and generate a 9x9 output. So the code must process the input and generate a 9x9 grid. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are not 9x9. Maybe the problem is that the user has a mistake in the examples. But given that the user provided the examples, I have to work with them. Let me try to find a pattern between the first example's input and output.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: all zeros.\nRow 1: all zeros.\nRow 2: 0 0 3 0 0 6 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 8 0 0 7 0 0 0\nRow 6: all zeros.\nRow 7: all zeros.\nRow 8: all zeros.\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\nRow 1: 0 8 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 7 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 7: 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\n\nLooking at the input and output, the third row in the input has a 3 in position (2,2). In the output, the third row has an 8 in position (2,2). Also, the fifth row in the input has an 8 in position (5,2). In the output, the fifth row has a 7 in position (5,2). Hmm. Not sure.\n\nLooking at the output's first row, there's an 8 in position (0,0) and a 3 in position (0,7). The input's first row is all zeros. So maybe those positions are being filled with numbers based on their position. For example, maybe positions (0,0) and (0,7) are being set to 8 and 3, respectively. But how?\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 1, the third row has 8 in position (2,2). The input's third row has 3 there. So maybe there's a transformation where certain positions are replaced with specific numbers based on their row and column. For example, maybe positions where the row is even and column is even are being replaced with 8, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are based on some pattern like the sum of the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input and some transformation. For example, in the output, the third row's third column is 8. The input's third row's third column is 3. So 3 becomes 8. But why?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row has 8 in column 0. The input's first row is all zeros. So maybe the 8 is a fixed value. Similarly, the output's first row has 3 in column 7. Maybe that's a fixed value. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotation or reflection of the input. For example, maybe the output is the input rotated 90 degrees. But in Example 1, the input's third row is 0 0 3 0 0 6 0 0 0. Rotating 90 degrees would make it a column in the output. But the output's third row is 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their position. For example, in the output, the first row has 8 at (0,0) and 3 at (0,7). Maybe those positions are being set to 8 and 3 based on their position. Similarly, in the second row of the output, there's an 8 at (1,1) and 3 at (1,7). So maybe for rows 0 and 1, the first column is 8 and the seventh column is 3. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells with specific values based on their row and column. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, then some function of i and j is used to determine the value. For example, if i is even, then set to 8, else 3. But that doesn't fit all cases.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the outputs of the examples. For example, in Example 1's output, the third row has 8 in column 2. The input's third row had 3 there. So maybe the transformation is replacing certain positions with specific numbers. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row has 8 in column 0 and 3 in column 7. The second row has 8 in column 1 and 3 in column 7. The third row has 8 in column 2 and 3 in column 7. Wait, the third row of the output is 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0. So column 2 is 8, column 6 is 3? Or column 7? Let me check:\n\nRow 2 of output is [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. So column 2 is 8, column 5 is 3. So maybe for each row i, the value at column i is 8, and column 5 is 3? But that doesn't fit for other rows. For example, row 0 of output has 8 at column 0 and 3 at column 7. Row 1 has 8 at column 1 and 3 at column 7. Row 2 has 8 at column 2 and 3 at column 5. Hmm, that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 and 3 are placed in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in row i, column i is set to 8, and column 7 is set to 3. But in row 2, column 7 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions with specific values. For example, the positions where the row is 0, column is 0 is 8, row 0 column 7 is 3. Row 1, column 1 is 8, row 1 column 7 is 3. Row 2, column 2 is 8, row 2 column 5 is 3. But that seems arbitrary. Maybe there's a pattern where for row i, column i is 8, and column 5 is 3. But that doesn't fit for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input and some other pattern. For example, in the input, the third row has a 3 in column 2. In the output, that position is 8. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their position.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me look at other examples.\n\nExample 2's input and output:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 7 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 7\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\nRow 7: 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 8\nRow 8: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 7 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 8 0 8\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 2 0 8 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 2 8 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 8 6 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 8 3 0 6 6\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 7 0 8 0 0 2 2 6\nRow 6: 7 0 0 7 0 8 0 0 0 2 2 0\nRow 7: 0 7 7 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 7\nRow 8: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 2 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 6 0 0 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 6 0 0 0 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLooking at the output for row 0, there's a 3 in column 4, and 3 in column 6. The input for row 0 has 8 in column 6. So maybe some transformation is happening here. For example, the 8 in column 6 becomes 3. But why?\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 2, row 6 has 7 in column 0. The input for row 6 is all zeros. So perhaps certain positions are being filled with specific values. For example, row 6, column 0 is 7. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions with specific values based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns are filled with 8 or 3. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by applying some kind of transformation to the input, such as swapping certain positions or adding values. For example, in Example 1, the third row's third column is 3, and the output has 8 there. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced with 8 or 3 based on their position.\n\nBut how to find a general rule?\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the outputs. For example, in the first example's output, the third row has 8 in column 2 and 3 in column 5. In the second example's output, row 0 has 3 in column 4 and 6. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with 3 or 8 based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their row and column indices. For example, for cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 8, if j is even, set to 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where certain positions are filled with numbers based on the input. For example, if the input has a 3 in a certain position, the output has 8 there. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input and some fixed pattern. For example, in the first example, the output's first row has 8 and 3 in certain positions, which may be fixed. But how?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells with specific values based on their position. For example, for cell (i,j), if i + j is even, set to 8, else 3. But let's test this with the first example.\n\nIn the first example's output, the first row (i=0) has 8 at (0,0) (i+j=0, even) and 3 at (0,7) (i+j=7, odd). That fits. For row 1, (i=1, j=1) is 8 (i+j=2, even). (i=1, j=7) is 3 (i+j=8, even). Wait, that doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some other rule. For example, for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 8 if j is even, else 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions with specific values based on their row and column. For example, in the first example's output, the third row has 8 in column 2 (i=2, j=2), and 3 in column 5 (i=2, j=5). So maybe for row i, column j is set to 8 if j = i, and 3 if j = 5. But this is not consistent with other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are filled with 8 or 3 based on their position. For example, in the first example's output, the first row has 8 in column 0 and 3 in column 7. The second row has 8 in column 1 and 3 in column 7. The third row has 8 in column 2 and 3 in column 5. The fourth row has 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0. So maybe the 3 is in column 5 for row 2, but not for row 3. This is not consistent.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look at the test input and see what it might transform into.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0\n7 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n8 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output should be 9x9. But the test input is 8x8. So the code must take this input and produce a 9x9 output. But how?\n\nMaybe the code is supposed to pad the input with zeros to make it 9x9. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, the code is supposed to apply some transformation based on the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is supposed to replace certain positions based on their position. For example, the test input has a 3 in position (0,2), and the output's first row has 8 in (0,0) and 3 in (0,7). But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to replace certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their row and column. For example, in the first example, the output has 8 in (i,j) where i = j, and 3 in (i, 7 - i). But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example's output, the first row has 8 in (0,0) and 3 in (0,7). The second row has 8 in (1,1) and 3 in (1,7). The third row has 8 in (2,2) and 3 in (2,5). The fourth row has 2 2 in positions (3,3) and (3,4). So perhaps for rows 0-2, the 8 is in (i,i), and the 3 is in (i, 7 - i) for rows 0 and 1, but not for row 2. This is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is supposed to replace certain cells with values based on some pattern. For example, for each cell (i,j), if i is even, then set to 8 if j is even, else 3. But this is not working for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to replace certain cells based on their position in the grid. For example, the output is a 9x9 grid where the first row has 8 in column 0 and 3 in column 7, and the second row has 8 in column 1 and 3 in column 7, and so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for other clues. For example, in Example 1's output, the fifth row has 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0 0. The input's fifth row is 0 0 8 0 0 7 0 0 0. So the 8 in the input's fifth row, third column becomes 7 in the output. So maybe there's a transformation where certain positions are replaced with specific values based on their position.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the outputs of all examples. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 8 in column 2 and 3 in column 5. In Example 2, the output's row 0 has 3 in column 4 and 6. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with 3 or 8 based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions with values based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns are filled with 8 or 3. But without more data, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation involves replacing certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their row and column indices. For example, for each cell (i,j), if i + j is even, set to 8, else set to 3. But let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the third row (i=2) has 3 in column 2 (j=2). i + j = 4, even. So according to this hypothesis, the output would have 8 in that position. Which matches the first example's output. For the first row (i=0), column 0 (j=0): i+j=0, even \u2192 8. Column 7 (j=7): i+j=7, odd \u2192 3. Which matches the output. For row 1, column 1 (i=1, j=1): 2 \u2192 even \u2192 8. Column 7: 1+7=8 even \u2192 8? But in the output, row 1 has 8 in column 1 and 3 in column 7. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nWait, the output for row 1 has 8 in column 1 and 3 in column 7. i=1, j=1: i+j=2 even \u2192 8. j=7: i+j=8 even \u2192 8. But the output has 3 there. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, then set to 8 in column i, and 3 in column 7-i. For row 0, column 0 is 8, column 7 is 3. For row 1, column 1 is 8, column 7 is 3. For row 2, column 2 is 8, column 5 is 3. But why column 5? 7 - 2 is 5. So this seems to fit. For row 2, j=5 is 7 - i = 7-2=5. So for row i, column i is 8, and column 7 - i is 3. But what about row 3? In the first example's output, row 3 is 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0. So column 3 is 2, column 4 is 2. So this doesn't fit the pattern. So this hypothesis is only valid for rows 0, 1, 2.\n\nBut in the first example's output, row 5 has 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0 0. So for row 5, column 2 is 7, column 5 is 6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows 0-2, the output has 8 in column i and 3 in column 7 - i. For other rows, it's different.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll try to implement this hypothesis and see if it fits the examples.\n\nSo the code would replace certain positions with 8 and 3 based on their row and column. For example, for each row i in 0-2, set cell (i,i) to 8 and cell (i, 7 - i) to 3. For other rows, leave as is. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to handle the other rows? For example, in the first example's output, row 3 is 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0. So the 2 2 are in columns 3 and 4. Maybe those are from the input's row 3, which had 2 2 in columns 3 and 4. So perhaps those are unchanged.\n\nBut in the first example's output, row 5 has 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0 0. The input's row 5 was 0 0 8 0 0 7 0 0 0. So the 8 in column 2 is replaced with 7, and the 7 in column 5 is kept as 6? Or maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each cell (i,j), if i is in 0-2, then set to 8 if j == i, and 3 if j == 7 - i. For other rows, leave as is. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut the test input is 8x8, so this would not apply. However, the code needs to handle any input and output 9x9. So perhaps the code is supposed to replace certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their row and column. For example, for each cell (i,j), if i is even, set to 8 if j is even, else 3. But this is not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the code may be replacing certain positions with specific values based on their row and column. For example, in the first example's output, the first three rows have 8 in column i and 3 in column 7 - i. For the test input, which is 8x8, perhaps the code is supposed to replace certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their row and column.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell (i,j) in the output grid, if i is in 0-2, then set to 8 if j == i, else 3 if j == 7 - i. Otherwise, leave as is. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut this would not handle the other examples. For example, in Example 2, the output has 3 in column 4 of row 0, which would fit the pattern if i=0, j=4 = 7 - i = 7-0=7, which is not 4. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the code is replacing certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their row and column. For example, in the first example, the output's first row has 8 in (0,0) and 3 in (0,7). The second row has 8 in (1,1) and 3 in (1,7). The third row has 8 in (2,2) and 3 in (2,5). So for row i, j = i is 8, and j = 5 is 3. But why 5? For row 2, 7 - i is 5. So for row i, j = i is 8, j = 7 - i is 3. But for row 2, j=5 is 7 - i = 5. So this fits. For row 0, j=7 is 7 - 0 =7. For row 1, j=6 is 7-1=6, but the output has 3 in column 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell (i,j) in the output grid, if i is in 0-2, then set to 8 if j == i, else 3 if j == 7 - i. For other rows, leave as is. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut the test input is 8x8, so the code would need to handle that. However, the code is supposed to return a 9x9 grid. So perhaps the code is supposed to replace certain positions based on their row and column in the input grid. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to replace certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their position in the input grid. For example, if the input has a 3 in a certain position, the output has 8 there. But how to determine that.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell in the output grid, if the row is 0-2, then set to 8 if column equals row, else 3 if column equals 7 - row. For other rows, leave as is. This would handle the first example, but not the others. But this is the best I can do given the time.\n"
