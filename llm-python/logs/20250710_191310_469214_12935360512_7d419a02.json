          "From observing the visual training examples:\n\n- **Color codes:**\n    - 0 = black (background)\n    - 6 = magenta/purple (in output and input, unchanged)\n    - 8 = blue (main region in input, preserved in output)\n    - 4 = yellow (new color in the output)\n\n## Pattern Analysis\n\n- In both input and output, the structure (walls/lines of zeros) are preserved.\n- The magenta (6) blocks stay the same in outputs.\n- \"Blue\" areas (8) are partly turned yellow (4) in the output, according to specific rules.\n\nThe yellow (4) in the output fills **enclosed rectangle regions** of blue, defined horizontally (in the second example) or vertically (in the first and third), but **excluding** any regions containing purple (6).\n\n### Detailed pattern:\n\n- For horizontal blue bands (between two black/0 rows), fill the full width with 4 except for:\n    - Any segment containing a 6 (magenta), which remains 8.\n- For vertical blue regions in other examples: a similar rule but applied to columns.\n- So, the logic seems to be: **replace every contiguous region of 8s fully enclosed by 0s (in a line \u2014 row or column), with 4s unless that region contains a 6, in which case leave 8s**.\n\nTo generalize:\n- If a horizontal (row) or vertical (column) segment of blue (8) is fully enclosed by black (0s), and does NOT contain a magenta (6), change it to yellow (4).\n- If it contains a magenta (6), leave it as blue (8).\n\nAfter deeper inspection:\n- Example 1 and 3: process **columns** (vertical stripes),\n- Example 2: process **rows** (horizontal bands).\n\nLet\u2019s infer the direction:\n- If the blue region stretches \"all across\" the rows, process horizontally (row-wise).\n- If the blue region stretches \"all across\" vertically, process columns.\n\nOr:\n- If the grid is taller than it is wide, bands are columns. If it's wider than it is tall, process rows. But Example 1 is (12,19), 19>12 (wider), but processed vertically (columns).\n- Instead, it looks like: in most grids with alternating vertical 0 stripes, process columns; with horizontal 0 stripes, process rows.\n\n**So:**\n\n- For each contiguous blue region between two black stripes (vertically or horizontally), fill with yellow unless it contains a magenta.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- For each row **if** there is a horizontal band of 8s split by 0s (\"blue bands\"):\n    - For each segment between 0s: if segment contains only 8s, fill with 4s, else leave as is.\n- Repeat for columns (if vertical bands).\n- To decide vertical vs horizontal: determine whether there are more vertical or horizontal wall lines of 0s.\n    - If the majority of black lines are complete rows (row of all black), process row-wise.\n    - If the majority are columns (column of all black), process column-wise.\n\nBut sometimes the wall stripes are not full lines (see the patterns). Instead, we can process in both directions:\n\n- For each row, find segments of 8s bounded by 0s (or start/end) that do not contain 6s, fill with 4s.\n- Likewise for columns.\n\nBut outputs only process per ONE direction, not both.\n\nSo, to match the pattern in the example, we need to infer the intended \"direction\".\n\n#### Option for direction inference:\n\n- If there are rows with many separate horizontal bands (broken by full width zeros), process horizontally.\n- Else, process vertically.\n\nOR: Use the largest number of zeros per row vs per column.\n\nLet\u2019s implement column-wise if there are more columns with a lot of zeros than rows with zeros, else row-wise.\n\n### Final Steps\n\n- Always output a grid of the same shape as the input.\n- If the input grid is not 12x19, pad or crop it. But in all the training inputs and test input, the output equals the input shape.\n\nTherefore: **the \"always output a 12\u00d719 grid\" is just a constraint; apply the rule and output a 12\u00d719 grid (by padding/cropping as needed).**\n\n### Implementation\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = grid.shape\n\n    # Decide whether to process rows or columns (vertical or horizontal bands)\n    # Count number of full zero rows and columns\n    num_full_zero_rows = np.sum(np.all(grid == 0, axis=1))\n    num_full_zero_cols = np.sum(np.all(grid == 0, axis=0))\n\n    # If more rows are full zeros, process row-wise, else column-wise.\n    process_rows = num_full_zero_rows >= num_full_zero_cols\n\n    out = grid.copy()\n\n    def process_line(line):\n        # line: a 1D np array\n        output = line.copy()\n        n = len(line)\n        i = 0\n        while i < n:\n            if line[i] == 0:\n                i += 1\n                continue\n            # Find segment (from i up to next 0 or end)\n            j = i\n            while j < n and line[j] != 0:\n                j += 1\n            segment = line[i:j]\n            # If segment contains 6 (magenta), skip\n            if 6 in segment:\n                pass  # leave as is (8s and 6s)\n            else:\n                # Replace 8s with 4s, leave others as is\n                for k in range(i, j):\n                    if line[k] == 8:\n                        output[k] = 4\n            i = j\n        return output\n\n    if process_rows:\n        # Process each row\n        for r in range(h):\n            out[r,:] = process_line(grid[r,:])\n    else:\n        # Process each column\n        for c in range(w):\n            out[:,c] = process_line(grid[:,c])\n\n    # Ensure output is 12x19 (as required)\n    OH, OW = 12, 19\n    final = np.zeros((OH, OW), dtype=int)\n    # Center the output if shape is different\n    top = max((OH - h) // 2, 0)\n    left = max((OW - w) // 2, 0)\n    bottom = min(top + h, OH)\n    right = min(left + w, OW)\n    # Crop if output is too big\n    src_top = 0\n    src_left = 0\n    if h > OH:\n        src_top = (h - OH) // 2\n        h = OH\n    if w > OW:\n        src_left = (w - OW) // 2\n        w = OW\n    final[top:bottom, left:right] = out[src_top:src_top+(bottom-top), src_left:src_left+(right-left)]\n    return final.tolist()\n```\n"

write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

          "From observing the visual training examples:\n\n- **Color codes:**\n    - 0 = black (background)\n    - 6 = magenta/purple (in output and input, unchanged)\n    - 8 = blue (main region in input, preserved in output)\n    - 4 = yellow (new color in the output)\n\n## Pattern Analysis\n\n- In both input and output, the structure (walls/lines of zeros) are preserved.\n- The magenta (6) blocks stay the same in outputs.\n- \"Blue\" areas (8) are partly turned yellow (4) in the output, according to specific rules.\n\nThe yellow (4) in the output fills **enclosed rectangle regions** of blue, defined horizontally (in the second example) or vertically (in the first and third), but **excluding** any regions containing purple (6).\n\n### Detailed pattern:\n\n- For horizontal blue bands (between two black/0 rows), fill the full width with 4 except for:\n    - Any segment containing a 6 (magenta), which remains 8.\n- For vertical blue regions in other examples: a similar rule but applied to columns.\n- So, the logic seems to be: **replace every contiguous region of 8s fully enclosed by 0s (in a line \u2014 row or column), with 4s unless that region contains a 6, in which case leave 8s**.\n\nTo generalize:\n- If a horizontal (row) or vertical (column) segment of blue (8) is fully enclosed by black (0s), and does NOT contain a magenta (6), change it to yellow (4).\n- If it contains a magenta (6), leave it as blue (8).\n\nAfter deeper inspection:\n- Example 1 and 3: process **columns** (vertical stripes),\n- Example 2: process **rows** (horizontal bands).\n\nLet\u2019s infer the direction:\n- If the blue region stretches \"all across\" the rows, process horizontally (row-wise).\n- If the blue region stretches \"all across\" vertically, process columns.\n\nOr:\n- If the grid is taller than it is wide, bands are columns. If it's wider than it is tall, process rows. But Example 1 is (12,19), 19>12 (wider), but processed vertically (columns).\n- Instead, it looks like: in most grids with alternating vertical 0 stripes, process columns; with horizontal 0 stripes, process rows.\n\n**So:**\n\n- For each contiguous blue region between two black stripes (vertically or horizontally), fill with yellow unless it contains a magenta.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- For each row **if** there is a horizontal band of 8s split by 0s (\"blue bands\"):\n    - For each segment between 0s: if segment contains only 8s, fill with 4s, else leave as is.\n- Repeat for columns (if vertical bands).\n- To decide vertical vs horizontal: determine whether there are more vertical or horizontal wall lines of 0s.\n    - If the majority of black lines are complete rows (row of all black), process row-wise.\n    - If the majority are columns (column of all black), process column-wise.\n\nBut sometimes the wall stripes are not full lines (see the patterns). Instead, we can process in both directions:\n\n- For each row, find segments of 8s bounded by 0s (or start/end) that do not contain 6s, fill with 4s.\n- Likewise for columns.\n\nBut outputs only process per ONE direction, not both.\n\nSo, to match the pattern in the example, we need to infer the intended \"direction\".\n\n#### Option for direction inference:\n\n- If there are rows with many separate horizontal bands (broken by full width zeros), process horizontally.\n- Else, process vertically.\n\nOR: Use the largest number of zeros per row vs per column.\n\nLet\u2019s implement column-wise if there are more columns with a lot of zeros than rows with zeros, else row-wise.\n\n### Final Steps\n\n- Always output a grid of the same shape as the input.\n- If the input grid is not 12x19, pad or crop it. But in all the training inputs and test input, the output equals the input shape.\n\nTherefore: **the \"always output a 12\u00d719 grid\" is just a constraint; apply the rule and output a 12\u00d719 grid (by padding/cropping as needed).**\n\n### Implementation\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = grid.shape\n\n    # Decide whether to process rows or columns (vertical or horizontal bands)\n    # Count number of full zero rows and columns\n    num_full_zero_rows = np.sum(np.all(grid == 0, axis=1))\n    num_full_zero_cols = np.sum(np.all(grid == 0, axis=0))\n\n    # If more rows are full zeros, process row-wise, else column-wise.\n    process_rows = num_full_zero_rows >= num_full_zero_cols\n\n    out = grid.copy()\n\n    def process_line(line):\n        # line: a 1D np array\n        output = line.copy()\n        n = len(line)\n        i = 0\n        while i < n:\n            if line[i] == 0:\n                i += 1\n                continue\n            # Find segment (from i up to next 0 or end)\n            j = i\n            while j < n and line[j] != 0:\n                j += 1\n            segment = line[i:j]\n            # If segment contains 6 (magenta), skip\n            if 6 in segment:\n                pass  # leave as is (8s and 6s)\n            else:\n                # Replace 8s with 4s, leave others as is\n                for k in range(i, j):\n                    if line[k] == 8:\n                        output[k] = 4\n            i = j\n        return output\n\n    if process_rows:\n        # Process each row\n        for r in range(h):\n            out[r,:] = process_line(grid[r,:])\n    else:\n        # Process each column\n        for c in range(w):\n            out[:,c] = process_line(grid[:,c])\n\n    # Ensure output is 12x19 (as required)\n    OH, OW = 12, 19\n    final = np.zeros((OH, OW), dtype=int)\n    # Center the output if shape is different\n    top = max((OH - h) // 2, 0)\n    left = max((OW - w) // 2, 0)\n    bottom = min(top + h, OH)\n    right = min(left + w, OW)\n    # Crop if output is too big\n    src_top = 0\n    src_left = 0\n    if h > OH:\n        src_top = (h - OH) // 2\n        h = OH\n    if w > OW:\n        src_left = (w - OW) // 2\n        w = OW\n    final[top:bottom, left:right] = out[src_top:src_top+(bottom-top), src_left:src_left+(right-left)]\n    return final.tolist()\n```\n"
