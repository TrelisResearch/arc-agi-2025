Additionally, it may extend the pattern to the corners in certain cases.\n\n### Python Function Implementation:\nBased on the observed pattern, here is a Python function that attempts to implement this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 6 or grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis function checks each element in the input grid and applies the transformation rules to create the output grid. It retains numbers other than 6, 8, and 4 unchanged.",
