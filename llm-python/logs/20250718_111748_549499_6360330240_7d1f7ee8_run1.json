The transformation seems to involve spreading or expanding certain values (like 8, 4, 3, 2, 1) into adjacent cells.\n2. Values like 0 seem to be the background or base value that remains unchanged.\n3. Values like 8 and 4 appear to be expanded into a block of the same value in adjacent cells.\n4. Values like 3 and 2 seem to be spread in a specific pattern.\n5. Values like 1 appear to be spread in a specific pattern as well.\n6. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"spread\" or \"expansion\" of certain values into adjacent cells.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads certain values into adjacent cells, while keeping 0s as is.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the values to be spread\n    spread_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 8]\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[0])):\n            # If the cell is one of the spread values\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] in spread_values:\n                # Spread the value to adjacent cells\n                # Check all four directions\n                directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n                for dx, dy in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                    if 0 <= ni < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= nj < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                        # If the new cell is 0, replace it with the spread value\n                        if transformed_grid[ni][nj] == 0:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the values to be spread\n    spread_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 8]\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[0])):\n            # If the cell is one of the spread values\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] in spread_values:\n                # Spread the value to adjacent cells\n                # Check all four directions\n                directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n                for dx, dy in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                    if 0 <= ni < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= nj < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                        # If the new cell is 0, replace it with the spread value\n                        if transformed_grid[ni][nj] == 0:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
