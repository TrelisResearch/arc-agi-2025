          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's start by analyzing Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 7x15 grid (since each line has 15 numbers), and the output is a 7x7 grid. Wait, the input for the examples is 7 rows, each with 15 elements. The output is 7 rows, each with 7 elements. So the transformation is from 7x15 to 7x7. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output. Let's take the first row of input: 1 1 0 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The output first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. Hmm. The output has 7 elements. How does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the output's first row, the 5 is in the 4th position. In the input's first row, the 5 is at position 12 (if we index from 0, maybe). Wait, the input row is 15 elements. Let me check the input for example 1. The first input row is 1 1 0 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So the 5 is at index 11 (0-based). The output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So the 5 is in the 4th position (index 3) of the output. That's the fourth element. So maybe the 5 is moved to that position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by some kind of transformation based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, maybe the output is generated by taking certain elements from the input and arranging them in a specific way.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1, the first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the fourth position. In the input, the 5 is in the 12th position (index 11). The input's first row has 15 elements. Maybe the output is generated by taking elements from the input's columns, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for certain patterns in the input. For example, in the input, the 5 is in the 12th position of the first row. The output's first row has a 5 in the fourth position. Maybe that's a clue. But how?\n\nLooking at other rows. Let's take the second row of the input for example 1: 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's second row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So the 1s are in positions 3,4,5 of the output. In the input row, the 1s are at positions 0, 2, and maybe others. Wait, the input row is 1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,... So the first row has 1s at positions 0, 2. The second row has 1s at positions 0, 2. The output row has 1s in positions 3,4,5. Maybe there's a pattern of moving certain numbers to specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of certain numbers and arranging them in a way that depends on their positions in the input. For example, maybe the output grid is built by taking elements from the input's columns in a certain way.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1, the first row of output is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the fourth column. The input's first row has a 5 at position 11 (0-based). The input's first row is 15 elements. The output is 7 elements. Maybe the output is generated by taking elements from the input's columns, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by grouping the input's elements into 7x7 grids. But that seems unclear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the output's structure. The output is 7x7. For example 1, the output's first row is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The second row is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. The third row is [0,0,0,0,0,6,0]. Fourth row is [0,0,0,0,0,6,0]. Fifth row is [0,0,0,0,2,2,0]. Sixth row is [0,3,3,3,3,0,0]. Seventh row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the first row has 5 in position 11. The output's first row has 5 in position 3. The 5 is in the fourth column of the output. The input's first row's 5 is in column 11 (if the input is 15 columns). But how does that relate to the output's column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the fourth column. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11 (if the input is 15 columns). Let's think: 15 columns in input. The output is 7 columns. Maybe each output column is derived from certain positions in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying some transformation based on their positions. For example, maybe the output grid is built by taking elements from the input's columns in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the fifth row is [0,0,0,0,2,2,0]. The input's fifth row is [6,0,6,0,3,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 3s are in positions 4,5,6. The output's fifth row has 2s in positions 4 and 5. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where certain numbers are moved to specific positions based on their original positions. For example, in example 1, the 5 is in the input's first row, column 11 (assuming 0-based). The output's first row, column 3 is 5. So maybe the output's column is calculated based on the input's column.\n\nWait, the input is 15 columns. The output is 7 columns. Maybe each output column is derived from a certain range of input columns. For example, the first output column (column 0) is derived from input columns 0-2, the second output column from 3-5, etc. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking elements from the input's columns in a way that depends on their value. For example, if a cell in the input is 0, it's replaced with 0 in the output, but if it's a certain number, it's moved to a specific position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output, the first row has a 5 in the fourth column. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. The output's fourth column is 5. Maybe the 5 is moved to the fourth column of the output, and other numbers are moved to other positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and grouping them into 7x7 grids, but that seems unclear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at example 2. Let's take the first input row of example 2: 2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output first row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The 5 is in the second position of the output. In the input, the 5 is at position 9 (0-based). The output's second column is 5. So maybe the 5 is moved to the second column of the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain elements from the input's rows and columns. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has a 5 in column 3. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. The output's column 3 is 5. So maybe there's a mapping between the input's column and the output's column. Let's think: 11 (input column) maps to 3 (output column). 15 input columns, 7 output columns. Maybe the output column is (input column) mod 7? Let's see: 11 mod 7 is 4. But in the output, the 5 is in column 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's (input column) divided by something. For example, 11 / 2 is 5.5, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's column is determined by the input's row and column. For example, for each output cell (i,j), the value is derived from the input's cell (i, j*something + something). But that's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first row has 5 in column 3. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. Let's think about the positions. The input's first row has 15 columns. The output has 7 columns. Maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output column is columns 0-2 of the input, the second is columns 3-5, third 6-8, fourth 9-11, fifth 12-14. But that would give 3 columns for each output column. But that's not matching the example. For example, in the first output row, the 5 is in column 3. If the input's columns 9-11 are mapped to output column 3, then the 5 is in column 11 of the input, which would be part of that range. So maybe the output's column is (input column) divided by 2, rounded down. For example, 11 divided by 2 is 5.5, which would be 5. But the output's column is 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking every third column. For example, columns 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. But that's not matching the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's first row has a 5 in column 3. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. Let's see: 11 - 7 = 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying some transformation based on their positions. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i, j*something + something). But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1. The output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the fourth column. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. The output's fourth column is 5. So maybe the 5 is moved to the fourth column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and replacing them with certain values based on their positions. For example, if the input has a certain value in a certain position, it's replaced with a certain value in the output.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2. The first input row is 2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The 5 is in the second column of the output. The input's 5 is at position 9 (0-based). So maybe the output's column is (input column + something) mod 7. For example, 9 mod 7 is 2. So the output column is 2. But in the output, the 5 is in column 1 (since the output row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0). Wait, the output row is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0], so the 5 is in column 1. But 9 mod 7 is 2. Hmm, that doesn't match. But maybe it's (input column) mod 7. 9 mod 7 is 2, but the 5 is in column 1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns and grouping them in a way that depends on the value. For example, if a column in the input has a certain value, it's used in the output's column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and placing them in the output based on their value. For example, the output's cells are filled with the input's elements that are non-zero, but arranged in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying some kind of transformation where certain values are moved to specific positions. For example, the output's cells are filled with the input's elements that are non-zero, but in a way that depends on their positions.\n\nAnother idea: looking at example 1's output, the fifth row is [0,0,0,0,2,2,0]. The input's fifth row is [6,0,6,0,3,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 3s are in positions 4,5,6. The output's fifth row has 2s in positions 4 and 5. Hmm, but that's not matching. Wait, maybe the output is generated by taking certain values from the input's rows. For example, the output's fifth row has 2s in positions 4 and 5, which are the positions where the input has 3s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying some transformation based on their positions. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i, j + something) if it's a certain value. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and replacing them with 0s except for certain positions where the value is non-zero. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1. The output's first row has 5 in the fourth column. The input's first row has 5 in column 11. The fourth column of the output is 5. The input's column 11 is the 12th column (if 0-based). The output's column 3 is the fourth column. So maybe the output's column is (input column) - 8. 11 - 8 = 3. That fits. Let's check another example. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5 is at column 11. 11 - 8 = 3, which is the fourth column (since 0-based). So maybe the output's columns are derived by subtracting 8 from the input's column. But the input has 15 columns. 15 - 8 = 7. So that would map input columns 8 to 14 to output columns 0 to 6. But what about other columns?\n\nWait, let's think. If the output's columns are derived from the input's columns, but the input has 15 columns. The output has 7 columns. Maybe the output's columns are derived from the input's columns 0-6, 7-13, 14? Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output column is columns 0-2 of the input, the second is 3-5, third 6-8, fourth 9-11, fifth 12-14. But that would give 3 columns for each output column. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a way that each output column is derived from a certain range of input columns. For example, the first output column is columns 0, 3, 6, 9, 12. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1's first row, the 5 is in column 3 of the output. The input's column 11 is the 12th column. 11 - 8 = 3. So maybe the output's column is (input column - 8) mod 7. Let's see. For input column 11, 11-8=3. For input column 12, 12-8=4. For input column 13, 5. For input column 14, 6. Then, for input columns 0-7, 0-7-8 would be negative. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and placing them into the output's columns based on their value. For example, the output's columns are filled with the input's elements that are non-zero, but in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1's first row, the 5 is in column 3. The input's first row has 5 in column 11. The output's column 3 is 5. So maybe the 5 is moved to column 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying a transformation where each output cell is derived from the input's cell in a certain position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i, j*2 + something). But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the first row has a 5 in column 3. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. Let's think of 11 as 3 + 8. Maybe the output's column is (input column) - 8. But then for input column 11, 11-8=3. That fits. What about other positions?\n\nFor example, in the second row of example 1's output, the row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 1s are in columns 3,4,5. In the input's second row, the 1s are at positions 0 and 2. But how does that map to the output's columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and placing them in the output based on their row and column. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i, j + something). But again, without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying a transformation where certain values are moved to specific positions. For example, in example 1's output, the first row's 5 is in column 3. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. Maybe the output's columns are filled with the input's elements that are in certain positions. For example, the output's column 3 is filled with the input's elements from columns 9-11 (since 9,10,11 are 3 columns, and 3 is the column index in output). But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying a transformation where each output cell (i,j) is filled with the input's cell (i, j + 2) if it's a certain value. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at example 3. The input is 7 rows of 15 elements. The output is 7 rows of 7 elements. Let's look at example 3's input and output.\n\nIn example 3's input, the first row is 2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The 5 is in column 4 of the output. The input's first row has a 5 in column 12 (0-based). So 12 - 8 = 4. That fits the same pattern as example 1. So maybe the output's column is (input column) - 8. But for input columns 0-7, (input column) - 8 would be negative. So maybe the output's column is (input column - 8) mod 7. Let's check:\n\nFor example 1's first row, input column 11: 11-8=3 mod 7 is 3. That's correct. For input column 12: 12-8=4 mod7=4. For input column 13: 5. For input column 14: 6. For input column 8: 8-8=0 mod7=0. Input column 9: 1 mod7=1. Input column 10: 2 mod7=2. So the output's columns are derived from input columns 8-14 (which are 7 columns) mapped to 0-6. But what about input columns 0-7? For example, input column 0: 0-8=-8 mod7 is -8 + 14 = 6. So 6 mod7 is 6. So input column 0 would be mapped to output column 6. Input column 1: 1-8=-7 mod7 is 0. So output column 0. Input column 2: 2-8=-6 mod7 is 1. Output column 1. Input column 3: 3-8=-5 mod7 is 2. Output column 2. Input column 4: 3-8=-4 mod7 is 3. Output column 3. Input column 5: 5-8=-3 mod7 is 4. Output column 4. Input column 6: 6-8=-2 mod7 is 5. Output column 5. Input column 7: 7-8=-1 mod7 is 6. Output column 6.\n\nSo this suggests that the output's columns are derived from the input's columns, with the mapping: for each input column c, the output column is (c - 8) mod 7. So for input columns 0-7, they are mapped to output columns 6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. For input columns 8-14, mapped to 0-6.\n\nBut how does this relate to the output values? For example, in example 1's first row, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in output column 3. According to the mapping, input column 11 (which is 11-8=3 mod7) is output column 3. So the 5 is taken from input column 11 and placed into output column 3. But what about the other columns in the output?\n\nIn example 1's first row, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So only the output column 3 has a non-zero value. So perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's elements from the columns that are mapped to the output's columns, and for each output column, the value is the input's element in that mapped column. But that would mean that each output column is filled with the input's element in the corresponding mapped column. But that would not explain the other examples.\n\nWait, in example 1's first row, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So the output column 3 is 5, which is the input's column 11. But what about the other columns? For example, output column 0 is 0. That would be the input's column 0 (0-8=-8 mod7=6). So input column 0's value is 1. But the output column 0 is 0. So that doesn't fit. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and placing them into the output's columns based on their mapped column, but only if they are non-zero. Or maybe there's some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and for each output column, the value is the input's element in the mapped column if it's non-zero. But in example 1's first row, the output column 3 is 5 (input column 11), which is non-zero. But other output columns are zero. So maybe the output is filled with the input's mapped column's value, but only if it's non-zero. But then, in example 1's first row, the output column 0 is 0, which would be the input's column 0 (value 1), which is non-zero. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and for each output column, the value is the input's element in the mapped column, but only if it's non-zero. But in example 1's first row, the input's column 0 is 1, which is non-zero, but the output column 0 is 0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and for each output column, the value is the input's element in the mapped column, but only if it's a certain value. For example, if the input's mapped column has a certain value, it's placed in the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying some transformation based on their value. For example, if the input's mapped column has a value of 5, it's placed in the output. Otherwise, it's 0. But that doesn't explain why in example 1's first row, the output column 3 is 5, which is the input's mapped column's value.\n\nBut then, for example 1's second row of output, which is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The input's second row is 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The mapped columns for output columns are:\n\noutput column 0: input column 0 (value 1)\noutput column 1: input column 1 (value 0)\noutput column 2: input column 2 (value 1)\noutput column 3: input column 3 (value 0)\noutput column 4: input column 4 (value 2)\noutput column 5: input column 5 (value 0)\noutput column 6: input column 6 (value 2)\n\nSo according to this, the output's second row would be 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2. But the actual output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this approach is not working.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the previous idea is incorrect. So what else can I think of?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking certain values from the input's rows. For example, in example 1's first row, the output has a 5 in column 3. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. But the output's column 3 is 5. Maybe the 5 is moved to the output's column 3, and other values are moved to other columns based on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying a transformation where each output cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i, j + something) if it's non-zero. But I'm not seeing the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's first row. The output is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the fourth column. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. So maybe the output's columns are derived from the input's columns in a way that depends on the row. For example, in row 0, the output columns are derived from input columns 8-14. In row 1, maybe from 7-13, etc. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and for each row, the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of the input. For example, the input has 15 columns. The last 7 columns are 8-14 (indices 8 to 14). So for each row, the output is the last 7 columns of the input. But in example 1's first row, the input's last 7 columns are 4 0 0 0 5 0 0. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nInput row 0: 1 1 0 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The last 7 columns are positions 8-14 (indices 8 to 14). Let's see:\n\nIndices 8: 0, 9:0, 10:0, 11:5, 12:0, 13:0, 14:0. So the last 7 columns are [0,0,0,5,0,0,0], which matches the first row of the output. Oh! That's exactly the first row of the output. So that seems to fit.\n\nLet's check example 1's second row of input: 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The last 7 columns are positions 8-14: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. But the output's second row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. That doesn't match. So this idea is not correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but only if they are non-zero. But in the second row of example 1, the last 7 columns are all zeros, but the output has 1s. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. So this approach works for the first row but not the others. Let's look at example 1's second row of output: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. How is this derived from the input's second row?\n\nThe input's second row is 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The last 7 columns are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. But the output's second row has 1s. So this suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nBut what if the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the first non-zero value in those columns? Or maybe some other transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the last 7 columns, but only if they are non-zero. But in example 1's second row, the last 7 columns are all zeros, but the output has 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but with some transformation. For example, in the second row of example 1's input, the columns 8-14 are all zeros, but the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but in each row, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's columns 8-14, but only if they are non-zero. But in example 1's second row, the input's columns 8-14 are all zeros, so the output would be all zeros, but the actual output is not. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look at other examples. Let's look at example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input first row is 2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The 5 is in column 1 of the output. The input's 5 is at position 9 (0-based). So if the output is generated by taking the last 7 columns of the input, then the last 7 columns would be positions 8-14. Let's see:\n\nInput row 0: positions 8-14 are 0,5,0,0,0,0,0. So the output's first row would be [0,5,0,0,0,0,0], which matches the example's output. Oh! That's exactly the case. So for example 2's first row, the output is the last 7 columns of the input.\n\nBut for example 1's second row, the input's last 7 columns are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0, but the output's second row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't fit. But maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by taking the last 7 columns of the input, but for each row, the output is the last 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, in example 1's second row, the input's last 7 columns are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. How does this happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but with some transformation. For example, the input's columns 8-14 are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0] for row 1 in example 1. But the output's second row is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but with some transformation based on the values in other columns. For example, in example 1's second row, the input's columns 8-14 are all zeros, but the output has 1s. This suggests that there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but only if the value is non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero. But in example 1's second row, the input's columns 8-14 are all zeros, so the output would be all zeros. But the actual output is not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut example 2's first row fits this pattern. Let's check example 2's second row of input. Input row 1: 2 0 2 0 0 6 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The last 7 columns are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. But the output's second row is 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nSo this approach works for example 2's first row but not others. So what's the pattern here?\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's second row of output, the output is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. The input's second row is [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 1s are in positions 0 and 2 of the input's row. The output's third column is 1, fourth 1, fifth 1. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0-2, and then some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way for each row. For example, for row i, the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to think differently. Let's look at the output of example 1's first row: the last 7 columns of the input are [0,0,0,5,0,0,0], which matches the output. For example 2's first row, the last 7 columns are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0], which matches the output. For example 3's first row, the input's last 7 columns are [0,0,0,0,5,0,0], which matches the output. So this seems to work for these examples.\n\nBut what about the second row of example 1? The input's second row is [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The last 7 columns are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output's second row is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. So this doesn't fit. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is generated by taking the last 7 columns of the input, but for each row, the output is the last 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, in example 1's second row, the input's last 7 columns are all zeros, but the output has 1s. How?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but with some transformation based on the values in other columns. For example, if there are 1s in the input's columns 0-7, they are moved to the output's columns 3-5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and then some other columns. For example, in example 1's second row, the input's columns 8-14 are all zeros, but the output has 1s. So this suggests that there's another part to the transformation.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's second row of output, the 1s are in columns 3,4,5. The input's second row has 1s in columns 0 and 2. Maybe the output's columns 3-5 are derived from the input's columns 0 and 2. For example, the 1s are moved to the output's columns 3-5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0-7, and for each row, the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-7, but with some transformation. For example, in example 1's second row, the input's columns 0-7 are [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4]. The output's second row is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. So the 1s in columns 0 and 2 are moved to columns 3-5. But how?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0-7 and applying some transformation. For example, the output's columns are derived from the input's columns 0-7, but with some rules. For example, for each row, the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-7 and then applying a transformation where certain values are moved to specific positions.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to think of the output as being formed by two parts: the last 7 columns of the input, and some other part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but if the value is zero, it's replaced with some other value based on the input's other columns.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's second row: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 1s are in columns 3,4,5. In the input's second row, the 1s are in columns 0 and 2. Maybe the output's columns 3-5 are derived from the input's columns 0 and 2. For example, the 1s are moved to the output's columns 3-5. But how?\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but if there are no non-zero values, then take the input's columns 0-7 and apply some transformation.\n\nBut this is just speculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but with some transformation based on the input's other columns. For example, if the input's columns 0-7 have certain values, they are used to fill the output's columns.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, and if there are no non-zero values, then the output is filled with the input's columns 0-7, but with some transformation.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, it's possible that the pattern is that the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of the input, but for some rows, the last 7 columns are not sufficient, and other columns are used. However, given that the first three examples' first rows fit this pattern, it's possible that this is the correct approach for the first part of the output, but other parts may require additional transformations.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement the transformation where the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of each input row. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nFor example 1's first row: last 7 columns are [0,0,0,5,0,0,0], which matches the output. For example 2's first row: last 7 columns are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0], which matches the output. For example 3's first row: last 7 columns are [0,0,0,0,5,0,0], which matches the output. For example 1's second row: last 7 columns are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. So this doesn't fit. But maybe there's another part to the transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of the input, but for some rows, the last 7 columns are replaced with other values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of the input for certain rows, and other columns for others. For example, in example 1's second row, the input's last 7 columns are all zeros, but the output has 1s. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2, but with some transformation.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the transformation where the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of each input row. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it fits some, and perhaps the other examples have other patterns.\n\nBut wait, let's look at example 2's second row. Input's second row is 2 0 2 0 0 6 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The last 7 columns are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. The output's second row is 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit. But what if the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2? For example, the input's columns 0-2 are 2,0,2. So the output's second row is 2,2,0,0,0,0,0. But the actual output is 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So this fits. But how?\n\nSo perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, and for each row, the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for rows where the last 7 columns are all zero, take the input's columns 0-2, and so on.\n\nBut this is not a clear pattern.\n\nAt this point, given the time, I think the best approach is to implement the transformation where the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of each input row. This fits the first row of all three examples, and perhaps the other examples have other transformations, but this is the best I can do based on the available information.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # take the last 7 elements of each row\n        transformed_row = row[-7:]\n        transformed.append(transformed_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, the output for example 1's second row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the actual output is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. So this would not match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut why does it work for the first rows of the examples? Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's second row of output, the 1s are in columns 3,4,5. These are the positions where the input's second row has 1s in columns 0 and 2. Maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2, and for each row, the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2, but with some transformation.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and if there are no non-zero values, then take the input's columns 0-2, but this is just a guess.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Given the time, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the transformation where the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of each input row, and see if that passes the examples. But it doesn't for example 1's second row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but if the value is zero, it's replaced with the value from the input's columns 0-2. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but if the value is zero, it's replaced with the value from the input's columns 0-2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think the best approach is to proceed with the initial idea that the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of each input row, even though it doesn't fit all examples, but it fits the first row of all examples. Maybe the other examples have other patterns, but this is the best I can do.\n\nBut the test input is given. Let's look at the test input and see what the expected output would be. But since I can't see the expected output, I have to proceed with the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but with some transformation. For example, in example 1's second row, the input's columns 8-14 are all zeros, but the output has 1s. So this suggests that there's another part to the transformation.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but if there are no non-zero values, then take the input's columns 0-2, and for each of those, apply some transformation.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to proceed with the initial idea and see if it can be adjusted. However, given the time, I'll proceed with the code that takes the last 7 columns of each row, even though it doesn't fit all examples, but it fits the first row of the examples, and perhaps the other examples have similar patterns.\n\nBut wait, looking at example 2's second row of input: 2 0 2 0 0 6 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The last 7 columns are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. The output's second row is 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So this suggests that the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2, which are 2,0,2, and then some transformation. But how?\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 0-2, but with some transformation. For example, the output's second row is 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. This could be the input's columns 0-2 (2,0,2) transformed into 2,2,0, and then the rest are zeros. But how?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that takes the last 7 columns of each row, and see if it passes the examples, even though it doesn't for all. But this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each column in the output, if the input's column is non-zero, it's placed in the output, otherwise, it's zero. But this would work for the first row of the examples.\n\nBut for example 1's second row, the input's columns 8-14 are all zeros, so the output would be all zeros, but the actual output is not. So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. The first row of all examples seems to be derived from the last 7 columns of the input. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of each input row, and the other rows have other patterns. But how?\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that takes the last 7 columns of each row, even though it doesn't fit all examples, but it fits the first rows of the examples.\n\nBut this would not pass the test cases, but given the information, it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's start by analyzing Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 7x15 grid (since each line has 15 numbers), and the output is a 7x7 grid. Wait, the input for the examples is 7 rows, each with 15 elements. The output is 7 rows, each with 7 elements. So the transformation is from 7x15 to 7x7. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output. Let's take the first row of input: 1 1 0 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The output first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. Hmm. The output has 7 elements. How does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the output's first row, the 5 is in the 4th position. In the input's first row, the 5 is at position 12 (if we index from 0, maybe). Wait, the input row is 15 elements. Let me check the input for example 1. The first input row is 1 1 0 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So the 5 is at index 11 (0-based). The output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So the 5 is in the 4th position (index 3) of the output. That's the fourth element. So maybe the 5 is moved to that position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by some kind of transformation based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, maybe the output is generated by taking certain elements from the input and arranging them in a specific way.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1, the first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the fourth position. In the input, the 5 is in the 12th position (index 11). The input's first row has 15 elements. Maybe the output is generated by taking elements from the input's columns, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for certain patterns in the input. For example, in the input, the 5 is in the 12th position of the first row. The output's first row has a 5 in the fourth position. Maybe that's a clue. But how?\n\nLooking at other rows. Let's take the second row of the input for example 1: 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's second row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So the 1s are in positions 3,4,5 of the output. In the input row, the 1s are at positions 0, 2, and maybe others. Wait, the input row is 1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,... So the first row has 1s at positions 0, 2. The second row has 1s at positions 0, 2. The output row has 1s in positions 3,4,5. Maybe there's a pattern of moving certain numbers to specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of certain numbers and arranging them in a way that depends on their positions in the input. For example, maybe the output grid is built by taking elements from the input's columns in a certain way.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1, the first row of output is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the fourth column. The input's first row has a 5 at position 11 (0-based). The input's first row is 15 elements. The output is 7 elements. Maybe the output is generated by taking elements from the input's columns, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by grouping the input's elements into 7x7 grids. But that seems unclear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the output's structure. The output is 7x7. For example 1, the output's first row is [0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. The second row is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. The third row is [0,0,0,0,0,6,0]. Fourth row is [0,0,0,0,0,6,0]. Fifth row is [0,0,0,0,2,2,0]. Sixth row is [0,3,3,3,3,0,0]. Seventh row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the first row has 5 in position 11. The output's first row has 5 in position 3. The 5 is in the fourth column of the output. The input's first row's 5 is in column 11 (if the input is 15 columns). But how does that relate to the output's column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the fourth column. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11 (if the input is 15 columns). Let's think: 15 columns in input. The output is 7 columns. Maybe each output column is derived from certain positions in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying some transformation based on their positions. For example, maybe the output grid is built by taking elements from the input's columns in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the fifth row is [0,0,0,0,2,2,0]. The input's fifth row is [6,0,6,0,3,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 3s are in positions 4,5,6. The output's fifth row has 2s in positions 4 and 5. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where certain numbers are moved to specific positions based on their original positions. For example, in example 1, the 5 is in the input's first row, column 11 (assuming 0-based). The output's first row, column 3 is 5. So maybe the output's column is calculated based on the input's column.\n\nWait, the input is 15 columns. The output is 7 columns. Maybe each output column is derived from a certain range of input columns. For example, the first output column (column 0) is derived from input columns 0-2, the second output column from 3-5, etc. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking elements from the input's columns in a way that depends on their value. For example, if a cell in the input is 0, it's replaced with 0 in the output, but if it's a certain number, it's moved to a specific position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output, the first row has a 5 in the fourth column. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. The output's fourth column is 5. Maybe the 5 is moved to the fourth column of the output, and other numbers are moved to other positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and grouping them into 7x7 grids, but that seems unclear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at example 2. Let's take the first input row of example 2: 2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output first row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The 5 is in the second position of the output. In the input, the 5 is at position 9 (0-based). The output's second column is 5. So maybe the 5 is moved to the second column of the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain elements from the input's rows and columns. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has a 5 in column 3. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. The output's column 3 is 5. So maybe there's a mapping between the input's column and the output's column. Let's think: 11 (input column) maps to 3 (output column). 15 input columns, 7 output columns. Maybe the output column is (input column) mod 7? Let's see: 11 mod 7 is 4. But in the output, the 5 is in column 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's (input column) divided by something. For example, 11 / 2 is 5.5, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's column is determined by the input's row and column. For example, for each output cell (i,j), the value is derived from the input's cell (i, j*something + something). But that's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first row has 5 in column 3. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. Let's think about the positions. The input's first row has 15 columns. The output has 7 columns. Maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output column is columns 0-2 of the input, the second is columns 3-5, third 6-8, fourth 9-11, fifth 12-14. But that would give 3 columns for each output column. But that's not matching the example. For example, in the first output row, the 5 is in column 3. If the input's columns 9-11 are mapped to output column 3, then the 5 is in column 11 of the input, which would be part of that range. So maybe the output's column is (input column) divided by 2, rounded down. For example, 11 divided by 2 is 5.5, which would be 5. But the output's column is 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking every third column. For example, columns 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. But that's not matching the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's first row has a 5 in column 3. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. Let's see: 11 - 7 = 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying some transformation based on their positions. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i, j*something + something). But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1. The output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the fourth column. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. The output's fourth column is 5. So maybe the 5 is moved to the fourth column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and replacing them with certain values based on their positions. For example, if the input has a certain value in a certain position, it's replaced with a certain value in the output.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2. The first input row is 2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The 5 is in the second column of the output. The input's 5 is at position 9 (0-based). So maybe the output's column is (input column + something) mod 7. For example, 9 mod 7 is 2. So the output column is 2. But in the output, the 5 is in column 1 (since the output row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0). Wait, the output row is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0], so the 5 is in column 1. But 9 mod 7 is 2. Hmm, that doesn't match. But maybe it's (input column) mod 7. 9 mod 7 is 2, but the 5 is in column 1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns and grouping them in a way that depends on the value. For example, if a column in the input has a certain value, it's used in the output's column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and placing them in the output based on their value. For example, the output's cells are filled with the input's elements that are non-zero, but arranged in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying some kind of transformation where certain values are moved to specific positions. For example, the output's cells are filled with the input's elements that are non-zero, but in a way that depends on their positions.\n\nAnother idea: looking at example 1's output, the fifth row is [0,0,0,0,2,2,0]. The input's fifth row is [6,0,6,0,3,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 3s are in positions 4,5,6. The output's fifth row has 2s in positions 4 and 5. Hmm, but that's not matching. Wait, maybe the output is generated by taking certain values from the input's rows. For example, the output's fifth row has 2s in positions 4 and 5, which are the positions where the input has 3s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying some transformation based on their positions. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i, j + something) if it's a certain value. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and replacing them with 0s except for certain positions where the value is non-zero. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1. The output's first row has 5 in the fourth column. The input's first row has 5 in column 11. The fourth column of the output is 5. The input's column 11 is the 12th column (if 0-based). The output's column 3 is the fourth column. So maybe the output's column is (input column) - 8. 11 - 8 = 3. That fits. Let's check another example. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5 is at column 11. 11 - 8 = 3, which is the fourth column (since 0-based). So maybe the output's columns are derived by subtracting 8 from the input's column. But the input has 15 columns. 15 - 8 = 7. So that would map input columns 8 to 14 to output columns 0 to 6. But what about other columns?\n\nWait, let's think. If the output's columns are derived from the input's columns, but the input has 15 columns. The output has 7 columns. Maybe the output's columns are derived from the input's columns 0-6, 7-13, 14? Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output column is columns 0-2 of the input, the second is 3-5, third 6-8, fourth 9-11, fifth 12-14. But that would give 3 columns for each output column. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a way that each output column is derived from a certain range of input columns. For example, the first output column is columns 0, 3, 6, 9, 12. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1's first row, the 5 is in column 3 of the output. The input's column 11 is the 12th column. 11 - 8 = 3. So maybe the output's column is (input column - 8) mod 7. Let's see. For input column 11, 11-8=3. For input column 12, 12-8=4. For input column 13, 5. For input column 14, 6. Then, for input columns 0-7, 0-7-8 would be negative. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and placing them into the output's columns based on their value. For example, the output's columns are filled with the input's elements that are non-zero, but in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1's first row, the 5 is in column 3. The input's first row has 5 in column 11. The output's column 3 is 5. So maybe the 5 is moved to column 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying a transformation where each output cell is derived from the input's cell in a certain position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i, j*2 + something). But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the first row has a 5 in column 3. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. Let's think of 11 as 3 + 8. Maybe the output's column is (input column) - 8. But then for input column 11, 11-8=3. That fits. What about other positions?\n\nFor example, in the second row of example 1's output, the row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 1s are in columns 3,4,5. In the input's second row, the 1s are at positions 0 and 2. But how does that map to the output's columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and placing them in the output based on their row and column. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i, j + something). But again, without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying a transformation where certain values are moved to specific positions. For example, in example 1's output, the first row's 5 is in column 3. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. Maybe the output's columns are filled with the input's elements that are in certain positions. For example, the output's column 3 is filled with the input's elements from columns 9-11 (since 9,10,11 are 3 columns, and 3 is the column index in output). But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying a transformation where each output cell (i,j) is filled with the input's cell (i, j + 2) if it's a certain value. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at example 3. The input is 7 rows of 15 elements. The output is 7 rows of 7 elements. Let's look at example 3's input and output.\n\nIn example 3's input, the first row is 2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The 5 is in column 4 of the output. The input's first row has a 5 in column 12 (0-based). So 12 - 8 = 4. That fits the same pattern as example 1. So maybe the output's column is (input column) - 8. But for input columns 0-7, (input column) - 8 would be negative. So maybe the output's column is (input column - 8) mod 7. Let's check:\n\nFor example 1's first row, input column 11: 11-8=3 mod 7 is 3. That's correct. For input column 12: 12-8=4 mod7=4. For input column 13: 5. For input column 14: 6. For input column 8: 8-8=0 mod7=0. Input column 9: 1 mod7=1. Input column 10: 2 mod7=2. So the output's columns are derived from input columns 8-14 (which are 7 columns) mapped to 0-6. But what about input columns 0-7? For example, input column 0: 0-8=-8 mod7 is -8 + 14 = 6. So 6 mod7 is 6. So input column 0 would be mapped to output column 6. Input column 1: 1-8=-7 mod7 is 0. So output column 0. Input column 2: 2-8=-6 mod7 is 1. Output column 1. Input column 3: 3-8=-5 mod7 is 2. Output column 2. Input column 4: 3-8=-4 mod7 is 3. Output column 3. Input column 5: 5-8=-3 mod7 is 4. Output column 4. Input column 6: 6-8=-2 mod7 is 5. Output column 5. Input column 7: 7-8=-1 mod7 is 6. Output column 6.\n\nSo this suggests that the output's columns are derived from the input's columns, with the mapping: for each input column c, the output column is (c - 8) mod 7. So for input columns 0-7, they are mapped to output columns 6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. For input columns 8-14, mapped to 0-6.\n\nBut how does this relate to the output values? For example, in example 1's first row, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in output column 3. According to the mapping, input column 11 (which is 11-8=3 mod7) is output column 3. So the 5 is taken from input column 11 and placed into output column 3. But what about the other columns in the output?\n\nIn example 1's first row, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So only the output column 3 has a non-zero value. So perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's elements from the columns that are mapped to the output's columns, and for each output column, the value is the input's element in that mapped column. But that would mean that each output column is filled with the input's element in the corresponding mapped column. But that would not explain the other examples.\n\nWait, in example 1's first row, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So the output column 3 is 5, which is the input's column 11. But what about the other columns? For example, output column 0 is 0. That would be the input's column 0 (0-8=-8 mod7=6). So input column 0's value is 1. But the output column 0 is 0. So that doesn't fit. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and placing them into the output's columns based on their mapped column, but only if they are non-zero. Or maybe there's some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and for each output column, the value is the input's element in the mapped column if it's non-zero. But in example 1's first row, the output column 3 is 5 (input column 11), which is non-zero. But other output columns are zero. So maybe the output is filled with the input's mapped column's value, but only if it's non-zero. But then, in example 1's first row, the output column 0 is 0, which would be the input's column 0 (value 1), which is non-zero. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and for each output column, the value is the input's element in the mapped column, but only if it's non-zero. But in example 1's first row, the input's column 0 is 1, which is non-zero, but the output column 0 is 0. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and for each output column, the value is the input's element in the mapped column, but only if it's a certain value. For example, if the input's mapped column has a certain value, it's placed in the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying some transformation based on their value. For example, if the input's mapped column has a value of 5, it's placed in the output. Otherwise, it's 0. But that doesn't explain why in example 1's first row, the output column 3 is 5, which is the input's mapped column's value.\n\nBut then, for example 1's second row of output, which is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The input's second row is 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The mapped columns for output columns are:\n\noutput column 0: input column 0 (value 1)\noutput column 1: input column 1 (value 0)\noutput column 2: input column 2 (value 1)\noutput column 3: input column 3 (value 0)\noutput column 4: input column 4 (value 2)\noutput column 5: input column 5 (value 0)\noutput column 6: input column 6 (value 2)\n\nSo according to this, the output's second row would be 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2. But the actual output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this approach is not working.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the previous idea is incorrect. So what else can I think of?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking certain values from the input's rows. For example, in example 1's first row, the output has a 5 in column 3. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. But the output's column 3 is 5. Maybe the 5 is moved to the output's column 3, and other values are moved to other columns based on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and applying a transformation where each output cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i, j + something) if it's non-zero. But I'm not seeing the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's first row. The output is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the fourth column. The input's first row has a 5 in column 11. So maybe the output's columns are derived from the input's columns in a way that depends on the row. For example, in row 0, the output columns are derived from input columns 8-14. In row 1, maybe from 7-13, etc. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's elements and for each row, the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of the input. For example, the input has 15 columns. The last 7 columns are 8-14 (indices 8 to 14). So for each row, the output is the last 7 columns of the input. But in example 1's first row, the input's last 7 columns are 4 0 0 0 5 0 0. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nInput row 0: 1 1 0 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The last 7 columns are positions 8-14 (indices 8 to 14). Let's see:\n\nIndices 8: 0, 9:0, 10:0, 11:5, 12:0, 13:0, 14:0. So the last 7 columns are [0,0,0,5,0,0,0], which matches the first row of the output. Oh! That's exactly the first row of the output. So that seems to fit.\n\nLet's check example 1's second row of input: 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The last 7 columns are positions 8-14: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. But the output's second row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. That doesn't match. So this idea is not correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but only if they are non-zero. But in the second row of example 1, the last 7 columns are all zeros, but the output has 1s. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. So this approach works for the first row but not the others. Let's look at example 1's second row of output: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. How is this derived from the input's second row?\n\nThe input's second row is 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The last 7 columns are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. But the output's second row has 1s. So this suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nBut what if the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the first non-zero value in those columns? Or maybe some other transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the last 7 columns, but only if they are non-zero. But in example 1's second row, the last 7 columns are all zeros, but the output has 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but with some transformation. For example, in the second row of example 1's input, the columns 8-14 are all zeros, but the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but in each row, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's columns 8-14, but only if they are non-zero. But in example 1's second row, the input's columns 8-14 are all zeros, so the output would be all zeros, but the actual output is not. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look at other examples. Let's look at example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input first row is 2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The 5 is in column 1 of the output. The input's 5 is at position 9 (0-based). So if the output is generated by taking the last 7 columns of the input, then the last 7 columns would be positions 8-14. Let's see:\n\nInput row 0: positions 8-14 are 0,5,0,0,0,0,0. So the output's first row would be [0,5,0,0,0,0,0], which matches the example's output. Oh! That's exactly the case. So for example 2's first row, the output is the last 7 columns of the input.\n\nBut for example 1's second row, the input's last 7 columns are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0, but the output's second row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't fit. But maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by taking the last 7 columns of the input, but for each row, the output is the last 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, in example 1's second row, the input's last 7 columns are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. How does this happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but with some transformation. For example, the input's columns 8-14 are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0] for row 1 in example 1. But the output's second row is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut wait, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but with some transformation based on the values in other columns. For example, in example 1's second row, the input's columns 8-14 are all zeros, but the output has 1s. This suggests that there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but only if the value is non-zero. Otherwise, it's zero. But in example 1's second row, the input's columns 8-14 are all zeros, so the output would be all zeros. But the actual output is not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut example 2's first row fits this pattern. Let's check example 2's second row of input. Input row 1: 2 0 2 0 0 6 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The last 7 columns are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. But the output's second row is 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nSo this approach works for example 2's first row but not others. So what's the pattern here?\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's second row of output, the output is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. The input's second row is [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The 1s are in positions 0 and 2 of the input's row. The output's third column is 1, fourth 1, fifth 1. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0-2, and then some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way for each row. For example, for row i, the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to think differently. Let's look at the output of example 1's first row: the last 7 columns of the input are [0,0,0,5,0,0,0], which matches the output. For example 2's first row, the last 7 columns are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0], which matches the output. For example 3's first row, the input's last 7 columns are [0,0,0,0,5,0,0], which matches the output. So this seems to work for these examples.\n\nBut what about the second row of example 1? The input's second row is [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The last 7 columns are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output's second row is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. So this doesn't fit. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the output is generated by taking the last 7 columns of the input, but for each row, the output is the last 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, in example 1's second row, the input's last 7 columns are all zeros, but the output has 1s. How?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but with some transformation based on the values in other columns. For example, if there are 1s in the input's columns 0-7, they are moved to the output's columns 3-5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and then some other columns. For example, in example 1's second row, the input's columns 8-14 are all zeros, but the output has 1s. So this suggests that there's another part to the transformation.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's second row of output, the 1s are in columns 3,4,5. The input's second row has 1s in columns 0 and 2. Maybe the output's columns 3-5 are derived from the input's columns 0 and 2. For example, the 1s are moved to the output's columns 3-5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0-7, and for each row, the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-7, but with some transformation. For example, in example 1's second row, the input's columns 0-7 are [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4]. The output's second row is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. So the 1s in columns 0 and 2 are moved to columns 3-5. But how?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 0-7 and applying some transformation. For example, the output's columns are derived from the input's columns 0-7, but with some rules. For example, for each row, the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-7 and then applying a transformation where certain values are moved to specific positions.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to think of the output as being formed by two parts: the last 7 columns of the input, and some other part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but if the value is zero, it's replaced with some other value based on the input's other columns.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1's second row: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 1s are in columns 3,4,5. In the input's second row, the 1s are in columns 0 and 2. Maybe the output's columns 3-5 are derived from the input's columns 0 and 2. For example, the 1s are moved to the output's columns 3-5. But how?\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but if there are no non-zero values, then take the input's columns 0-7 and apply some transformation.\n\nBut this is just speculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but with some transformation based on the input's other columns. For example, if the input's columns 0-7 have certain values, they are used to fill the output's columns.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, and if there are no non-zero values, then the output is filled with the input's columns 0-7, but with some transformation.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, it's possible that the pattern is that the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of the input, but for some rows, the last 7 columns are not sufficient, and other columns are used. However, given that the first three examples' first rows fit this pattern, it's possible that this is the correct approach for the first part of the output, but other parts may require additional transformations.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement the transformation where the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of each input row. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nFor example 1's first row: last 7 columns are [0,0,0,5,0,0,0], which matches the output. For example 2's first row: last 7 columns are [0,5,0,0,0,0,0], which matches the output. For example 3's first row: last 7 columns are [0,0,0,0,5,0,0], which matches the output. For example 1's second row: last 7 columns are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. So this doesn't fit. But maybe there's another part to the transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of the input, but for some rows, the last 7 columns are replaced with other values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of the input for certain rows, and other columns for others. For example, in example 1's second row, the input's last 7 columns are all zeros, but the output has 1s. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2, but with some transformation.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the transformation where the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of each input row. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it fits some, and perhaps the other examples have other patterns.\n\nBut wait, let's look at example 2's second row. Input's second row is 2 0 2 0 0 6 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The last 7 columns are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. The output's second row is 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So this doesn't fit. But what if the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2? For example, the input's columns 0-2 are 2,0,2. So the output's second row is 2,2,0,0,0,0,0. But the actual output is 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So this fits. But how?\n\nSo perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, and for each row, the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for rows where the last 7 columns are all zero, take the input's columns 0-2, and so on.\n\nBut this is not a clear pattern.\n\nAt this point, given the time, I think the best approach is to implement the transformation where the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of each input row. This fits the first row of all three examples, and perhaps the other examples have other transformations, but this is the best I can do based on the available information.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # take the last 7 elements of each row\n        transformed_row = row[-7:]\n        transformed.append(transformed_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, the output for example 1's second row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the actual output is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. So this would not match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut why does it work for the first rows of the examples? Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's second row of output, the 1s are in columns 3,4,5. These are the positions where the input's second row has 1s in columns 0 and 2. Maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2, and for each row, the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2, but with some transformation.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and if there are no non-zero values, then take the input's columns 0-2, but this is just a guess.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Given the time, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the transformation where the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of each input row, and see if that passes the examples. But it doesn't for example 1's second row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but if the value is zero, it's replaced with the value from the input's columns 0-2. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but if the value is zero, it's replaced with the value from the input's columns 0-2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think the best approach is to proceed with the initial idea that the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of each input row, even though it doesn't fit all examples, but it fits the first row of all examples. Maybe the other examples have other patterns, but this is the best I can do.\n\nBut the test input is given. Let's look at the test input and see what the expected output would be. But since I can't see the expected output, I have to proceed with the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but with some transformation. For example, in example 1's second row, the input's columns 8-14 are all zeros, but the output has 1s. So this suggests that there's another part to the transformation.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 8-14, but if there are no non-zero values, then take the input's columns 0-2, and for each of those, apply some transformation.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to proceed with the initial idea and see if it can be adjusted. However, given the time, I'll proceed with the code that takes the last 7 columns of each row, even though it doesn't fit all examples, but it fits the first row of the examples, and perhaps the other examples have similar patterns.\n\nBut wait, looking at example 2's second row of input: 2 0 2 0 0 6 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The last 7 columns are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. The output's second row is 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So this suggests that the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2, which are 2,0,2, and then some transformation. But how?\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 0-2, and for each row, the output is the input's columns 0-2, but with some transformation. For example, the output's second row is 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. This could be the input's columns 0-2 (2,0,2) transformed into 2,2,0, and then the rest are zeros. But how?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that takes the last 7 columns of each row, and see if it passes the examples, even though it doesn't for all. But this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, but for each row, the output is formed by taking the input's columns 8-14, and for each column in the output, if the input's column is non-zero, it's placed in the output, otherwise, it's zero. But this would work for the first row of the examples.\n\nBut for example 1's second row, the input's columns 8-14 are all zeros, so the output would be all zeros, but the actual output is not. So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. The first row of all examples seems to be derived from the last 7 columns of the input. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of each input row, and the other rows have other patterns. But how?\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that takes the last 7 columns of each row, even though it doesn't fit all examples, but it fits the first rows of the examples.\n\nBut this would not pass the test cases, but given the information, it's the best I can do.\n"
