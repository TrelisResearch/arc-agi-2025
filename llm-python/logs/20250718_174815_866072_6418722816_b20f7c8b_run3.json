The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others based on their position and value.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where values in the left half of the grid (columns 0-10) are being transformed in a specific way, while the right half (columns 11-21) seems to be more static or transformed differently.\n3. There's a pattern where certain values (like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) are being replaced with other values in a way that seems to follow a specific rule, possibly based on their position and value.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others based on their position and value.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex rules could be added if needed\n    for row in range(18):\n        for col in range(22):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                # Keep 0 as is\n                continue\n            elif grid[row][col] == 1:\n                # Replace 1 with 2 in certain positions\n                if row < 8 and col < 11:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            elif grid[row][col] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if row < 8 and col < 11:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 3\n            elif grid[row][col] == 3:\n                # Replace 3 with 4 in certain positions\n                if row < 8 and col < 11:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 4\n            elif grid[row][col] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 5 in certain positions\n                if row < 8 and col < 11:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 5\n            elif grid[row][col] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with 6 in certain positions\n                if row < 8 and col < 11:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 6\n            elif grid[row][col] == 6:\n                # Replace 6 with 7 in certain positions\n                if row < 8 and col < 11:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 7\n            elif grid[row][col] == 7:\n                # Replace 7 with 8 in certain positions\n                if row < 8 and col < 11:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n            elif grid[row][col] == 8:\n                # Keep 8 as is\n                continue\n            elif grid[row][col] == 9:\n                # Keep 9 as is\n                continue\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis implementation is a simplified version based on observed patterns. It replaces certain values with others based on their position and value, but it's not a perfect solution for all training examples.
