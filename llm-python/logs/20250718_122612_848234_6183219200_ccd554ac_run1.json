    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nFirst, Example 1: The input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 9x9 grid. Looking at the input, the first row is 2 0 2. The output for that row is 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2. Wait, so each row in the input is being repeated three times? But the output is 9x9. Let me check. The input is 3 rows, and the output has 9 rows. So maybe each row in the input is expanded into three rows. But how?\n\nLooking at the output for the first row of input: the output rows are 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2. Wait, that's 9 elements. So maybe each input row is being duplicated three times? But the input is 3 rows, and the output is 9 rows. So perhaps each row in the input is repeated three times, and each element in that row is duplicated three times? Or maybe each row is expanded into three rows, and each element is repeated three times in a row.\n\nWait, looking at the output for example 1: The first three rows of the output are:\n\n2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2\n0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThen the next three rows are the same as the first three. Then again the same. So the output is three copies of the input rows, but each row is expanded into three times? Or maybe the input is being tiled in some way.\n\nWait, the input is 3x3. The output is 9x9. So maybe the input is being expanded by a factor of 3 in both directions. Like, each cell in the input is replicated three times in each direction. But that might not fit. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated three times in both rows and columns. For example, if the input is a 3x3 grid, then the output is a 9x9 grid where each row is the same as the input's rows repeated three times, and each column is repeated three times. But that might not be the case.\n\nLooking at example 2: Input is 2x2. Output is 4x4. The input is:\n\n1 0\n1 1\n\nOutput is:\n\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1\n\nSo each row of the input is repeated twice, and each element in the row is repeated twice. For example, the first row of input is 1 0, and in the output, the first two rows are 1 0 1 0 and 1 1 1 1. Wait, maybe the input is being tiled in a way that each cell is replicated in a grid. Like, the input is a 2x2 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is repeated in a 2x2 pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2, the output seems to be the input grid expanded by a factor of 2 in both directions. For example, each row in the input is duplicated twice, and each element in the row is duplicated twice. But that might not be the case. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [1, 0]\n\nRow 1: [1, 1]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nRow 1: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow 2: [1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nRow 3: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nSo, the output is the input rows repeated twice, and each row is duplicated twice. But the first row of input is [1,0], and in the output, the first row is [1,0,1,0], which is the original row repeated twice. Similarly, the second row is [1,1], and in the output, it's [1,1,1,1], which is the original row repeated twice. Then the next two rows are the same as the first two. So the output is the input grid repeated twice in rows and columns. So for a 2x2 input, the output is 4x4, which is the input grid expanded by 2x2.\n\nSimilarly, example 3: input is 2x2. Output is 4x4. The input is:\n\n0 3\n\n3 0\n\nOutput:\n\n0 3 0 3\n\n3 0 3 0\n\n0 3 0 3\n\n3 0 3 0\n\nSo the same pattern. Each row of the input is duplicated twice, and each element is duplicated twice. So the output is the input grid expanded by 2x2. So for example, the first row of input is [0,3], and the first row of output is [0,3,0,3], which is the original row repeated twice. Then the next row is [3,0] repeated twice. Then the same again.\n\nSo this seems to be a pattern where the input grid is expanded by a factor of 3 in example 1, 2 in example 2 and 3. Wait, example 1's input is 3x3, output is 9x9. So the expansion factor is 3. So for example 1, the input is expanded by 3x3. For example 2 and 3, it's 2x2. But example 4's input is 3x3, and output is 9x9. Let's check example 4.\n\nExample 4 input is:\n\n0 0 8\n\n8 8 8\n\n8 0 0\n\nOutput is 9x9. Let's look at the first row of input: [0,0,8]. The first row of output is [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8]. So that's the original row repeated three times. Then the second row of input is [8,8,8], which in the output is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. Then the third row of input is [8,0,0], which becomes [8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. Then the next three rows are the same as the first three. So the output is the input rows repeated three times, and each row is duplicated three times. So the expansion factor is 3.\n\nSo for example 1, 4, and 5, the input is 3x3 and output is 9x9. So that's 3x3 expansion. But example 2 and 3 are 2x2 input, output 4x4. So the expansion factor is 2. But example 5 is input 4x4 (since the input is 4 rows, each with 4 elements), and output is 16x16? Wait, looking at example 5's input:\n\nInput is:\n\n0 0 2 0\n\n2 0 2 0\n\n0 2 0 2\n\n2 2 2 0\n\nSo that's 4 rows, each with 4 elements. The output is 16x16. So the output is 16 rows, each with 16 elements. So that's 4x4 expansion. So the expansion factor is 4. So the pattern seems to be that the input grid is expanded by a factor of N, where N is the size of the input grid. For example, if the input is 3x3, then output is 9x9. If input is 2x2, output is 4x4. If input is 4x4, output is 16x16.\n\nSo the general idea is that the output grid is the input grid expanded by a factor of K, where K is the size of the input grid. So for example, if the input is a grid of size M x N, then the output is (M*K) x (N*K), where K is the original size. Wait, but in the examples, the input is square. For example, example 1 is 3x3, example 2 is 2x2, example 3 is 2x2, example 4 is 3x3, example 5 is 4x4. So perhaps the expansion factor is the same as the original grid's size. So for a grid of size M x M (since all examples have square grids), the output is M*M x M*M. But how?\n\nWait, in example 2, the input is 2x2. The output is 4x4. So the expansion factor is 2. So the output is the input grid replicated in a way that each cell is repeated in a grid. For example, the output is the input grid tiled in a 2x2 pattern. So for each cell in the input, it's repeated in a 2x2 block. Then the entire output is the input grid tiled in a 2x2 pattern. So for example, the input is 2x2, and the output is 4x4, which is the input grid replicated in 2x2 blocks.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the output as being generated by taking each cell in the input grid and replicating it in a K x K block, where K is the original grid's size. For example, if the input is 3x3, then each cell is replicated in a 3x3 block, and the entire output is the input grid tiled in 3x3 blocks. But that would make the output 3x3 times larger. Wait, but that would be 3x3 times the original grid. So for example, if the input is 3x3, the output is 9x9. Which matches example 1, 4, etc.\n\nSo the transformation is to take each cell in the input grid and replicate it in a K x K block, where K is the original grid's size. Then the output is the input grid tiled in K x K blocks. So for example, the input is a grid of size M x M. The output is a grid of size M*M x M*M. Each cell (i,j) in the input is replicated in a block of size M x M. So the output grid is formed by tiling the input grid in a way that each cell is repeated M times in each direction.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's think of the input grid as a 2D array. The output grid is a 2D array where each cell (i,j) in the output is equal to the cell (i//K, j//K) in the input, where K is the original grid's size. Wait, no. Because for example, in example 2, the input is 2x2. The output is 4x4. So for output cell (0,0), it's the same as input (0,0). For output (0,1), it's input (0,0) again? Wait, no. Looking at example 2's input:\n\nInput is:\n\nRow 0: 1 0\n\nRow 1: 1 1\n\nOutput is:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 1: 1 1 1 1\n\nRow 2: 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 3: 1 1 1 1\n\nSo for output cell (0,0), it's input (0,0). For (0,1), it's input (0,1). For (0,2), it's input (0,0). For (0,3), input (0,1). So the output is generated by taking each row of the input and repeating it K times, where K is the original grid's size. Wait, but the original grid's size is 2. So for each row in the input, it's repeated K times. Then each row in the output is the input row repeated K times. But for example, the first row of the input is [1,0], and the first two rows of the output are [1,0,1,0] and [1,1,1,1]. So that's the input row repeated twice. So the output is the input grid's rows repeated K times, and each row is duplicated K times. So the output grid is formed by taking the input grid and tiling it in a K x K pattern. So for each row in the input, it's repeated K times, and each of those repeated rows is then repeated K times.\n\nWait, but that would make the output grid of size (M*K) x (N*K), where M and N are the original input dimensions. But in the examples, the input is square. So for example, input is 3x3, output is 9x9. So the output is generated by tiling the input grid in a K x K pattern, where K is the original grid's size.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each cell (i,j) in the output grid, the value is the same as the cell (i//K, j//K) in the input grid, where K is the original grid's size. Wait, but that's not the case. Let's take example 2. Input is 2x2. K is 2. For output cell (0,0), i//K is 0, j//K is 0. So input cell (0,0) is 1. Which matches. For output cell (0,1), i//K is 0, j//K is 0 (since 1//2=0). So input cell (0,0) is 1. But in the output, cell (0,1) is 0. Which is input (0,1). So that's not matching. So that approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by taking the input grid and replicating each cell in a K x K block. So for each cell (i,j) in the input, it's replicated in a block of K rows and K columns. So the output grid is formed by tiling the input grid in a K x K pattern. So the output grid is the input grid tiled K times in both directions. So the output grid is of size (M*K) x (N*K), where M and N are the original input dimensions.\n\nBut for example 2, input is 2x2, output is 4x4. So each cell in the input is replicated in a 2x2 block. So for output cell (0,0), it's input (0,0). For (0,1), it's input (0,1). For (1,0), it's input (1,0). For (1,1), it's input (1,1). Then the next block (rows 2-3, columns 0-1) is the same as the first block. So the output is the input grid tiled in 2x2 blocks. So the output grid is the input grid replicated K times in both directions.\n\nSo the way to generate the output is to take the input grid and for each row in the output, it is the input row repeated K times. Then, for each of those repeated rows, we repeat them K times. Wait, but that would make the output grid's rows be the input rows repeated K times, and then the entire output is that repeated K times. For example, for input 2x2:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow 0: [1, 0]\n\nRow 1: [1, 1]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nRow 1: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow 2: [1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nRow 3: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nWhich is the same as taking each row of the input and repeating it K times (K=2), and then repeating the entire set of rows K times. So the output is the input grid's rows repeated K times, and each row is repeated K times.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\n- Let K be the size of the input grid (number of rows, which is same as number of columns since all examples are square).\n\n- The output grid is K*K in size.\n\n- For each row in the output, it is the input row repeated K times.\n\n- Then, the entire output grid is the input rows repeated K times.\n\nWait, but that would make the output grid have K*K rows, each row being K times the input row. So for example, input is 2x2, K=2. So output has 2*2=4 rows. Each row is the input row repeated 2 times. So row 0 is [1,0,1,0], row 1 is [1,1,1,1], row 2 is same as row 0, row 3 same as row 1. Which matches example 2.\n\nSimilarly, example 1: input is 3x3. K=3. Output is 3*3=9 rows. Each row is the input row repeated 3 times. So the first row of input is [2,0,2], so the first three rows of the output are [2,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,2], and so on.\n\nBut looking at example 1's output, the first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2\n\nRow 1: 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\n\nRow 2: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThen the next three rows are the same as the first three. Then again the same. So the output is the input rows repeated K times (3 times), and each row is the input row repeated K times (3 times). So that's the pattern.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each row in the input, create a new row in the output by repeating the input row K times, where K is the original grid's size. Then, repeat this entire set of rows K times.\n\nSo for example, if the input is a 3x3 grid, the output is a 9x9 grid where each row is the input row repeated 3 times, and the entire set of rows is repeated 3 times.\n\nSo how to implement this in code?\n\nFirst, determine K, which is the size of the input grid. For example, if the input is a 3x3 grid, K=3.\n\nThen, for each row in the input, create a new row in the output by repeating the input row K times. Then, repeat this entire set of rows K times.\n\nSo for example, for input rows:\n\nrow0 = [a, b, c]\n\nrow1 = [d, e, f]\n\nrow2 = [g, h, i]\n\nThen, for K=3, each row is repeated 3 times. So the first row in the output would be [a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c]. Then the second row would be [d, e, f, d, e, f, d, e, f], and third row [g, h, i, g, h, i, g, h, i]. Then, the next three rows are the same as the first three, and so on, for K times.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    K = len(grid)\n    # Create the expanded rows\n    expanded_rows = []\n    for row in grid:\n        expanded_row = row * K\n        expanded_rows.append(expanded_row)\n    # Now repeat the expanded_rows K times\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for _ in range(K):\n        transformed_grid.extend(expanded_rows)\n    return transformed_grid\n\nWait, but in example 2, the input is 2x2. The output is 4x4. So for K=2, the code would take each row of the input, repeat it K=2 times, then repeat the entire list of expanded rows K=2 times. So for the input rows [1,0] and [1,1], the expanded_rows would be [1,0,1,0] and [1,1,1,1]. Then, the transformed grid is the expanded_rows repeated 2 times, so the output is:\n\n[1,0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n\nWhich matches example 2. Similarly, example 3's input is 2x2. The output is 4x4. So the code would generate the same as example 2, but with the input rows [0,3] and [3,0], which when expanded would be [0,3,0,3] and [3,0,3,0], then repeated twice. Which matches example 3.\n\nBut wait, example 4's input is 3x3. The output is 9x9. Let's check. For example, the first row of input is [0,0,8]. Repeating it 3 times would be [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8], which matches the first row of the output. The second row of input is [8,8,8], which when repeated 3 times is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], which matches the second row of the output. The third row is [8,0,0], repeated 3 times is [8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0], which matches the third row of the output. Then the next three rows are the same as the first three. Which matches example 4.\n\nSo this seems to work for all examples. Let's check example 5.\n\nExample 5's input is 4x4. The output is 16x16. So K=4. Each row is repeated 4 times, then the entire expanded_rows is repeated 4 times. So for the first row of input, which is [0,0,2,0], repeated 4 times would be [0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. Which matches the first row of the output. The second row of input is [2,0,2,0], repeated 4 times would be [2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0], which matches the second row of the output. The third row of input is [0,2,0,2], repeated 4 times would be [0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2], which matches the third row of the output. The fourth row of input is [2,2,2,0], repeated 4 times would be [2,2,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,0], which matches the fourth row of the output. Then the next four rows are the same as the first four. So the output is 16 rows, each 16 elements. Which matches example 5.\n\nSo this approach seems to work for all examples. So the code is to take each row of the input, repeat it K times (where K is the size of the input grid), then repeat the entire list of expanded rows K times.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    K = len(grid)\n    expanded_rows = []\n    for row in grid:\n        expanded_row = row * K\n        expanded_rows.append(expanded_row)\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for _ in range(K):\n        transformed_grid.extend(expanded_rows)\n    return transformed_grid\n\nBut wait, the input is a 2D list. For example, in example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is 9x9. So the code would generate a list of 9 rows, each of 9 elements. Which is correct.\n\nBut let's test for example 2. The input is a 2x2 grid. So K=2. The code would generate 2 rows of expanded rows (each row is the input row repeated 2 times). Then, the transformed grid is those two rows repeated 2 times, resulting in 4 rows. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about the test input? The test input is:\n\n0 8 8 0 0\n\n8 8 8 8 8\n\n0 8 8 0 0\n\n8 8 8 8 8\n\n0 8 8 0 8\n\nSo the input is a 5x5 grid. So K=5. So each row is repeated 5 times. Then the entire list of expanded rows is repeated 5 times. So the output would be 25x25.\n\nBut the code would generate that. So the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach. The pattern is that the output is the input grid expanded by K times in both dimensions, where K is the original grid's size.\n\nTherefore, the Python function is as described.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nFirst, Example 1: The input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 9x9 grid. Looking at the input, the first row is 2 0 2. The output for that row is 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2. Wait, so each row in the input is being repeated three times? But the output is 9x9. Let me check. The input is 3 rows, and the output has 9 rows. So maybe each row in the input is expanded into three rows. But how?\n\nLooking at the output for the first row of input: the output rows are 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2. Wait, that's 9 elements. So maybe each input row is being duplicated three times? But the input is 3 rows, and the output is 9 rows. So perhaps each row in the input is repeated three times, and each element in that row is duplicated three times? Or maybe each row is expanded into three rows, and each element is repeated three times in a row.\n\nWait, looking at the output for example 1: The first three rows of the output are:\n\n2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2\n0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThen the next three rows are the same as the first three. Then again the same. So the output is three copies of the input rows, but each row is expanded into three times? Or maybe the input is being tiled in some way.\n\nWait, the input is 3x3. The output is 9x9. So maybe the input is being expanded by a factor of 3 in both directions. Like, each cell in the input is replicated three times in each direction. But that might not fit. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated three times in both rows and columns. For example, if the input is a 3x3 grid, then the output is a 9x9 grid where each row is the same as the input's rows repeated three times, and each column is repeated three times. But that might not be the case.\n\nLooking at example 2: Input is 2x2. Output is 4x4. The input is:\n\n1 0\n1 1\n\nOutput is:\n\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1\n\nSo each row of the input is repeated twice, and each element in the row is repeated twice. For example, the first row of input is 1 0, and in the output, the first two rows are 1 0 1 0 and 1 1 1 1. Wait, maybe the input is being tiled in a way that each cell is replicated in a grid. Like, the input is a 2x2 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is repeated in a 2x2 pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2, the output seems to be the input grid expanded by a factor of 2 in both directions. For example, each row in the input is duplicated twice, and each element in the row is duplicated twice. But that might not be the case. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [1, 0]\n\nRow 1: [1, 1]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nRow 1: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow 2: [1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nRow 3: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nSo, the output is the input rows repeated twice, and each row is duplicated twice. But the first row of input is [1,0], and in the output, the first row is [1,0,1,0], which is the original row repeated twice. Similarly, the second row is [1,1], and in the output, it's [1,1,1,1], which is the original row repeated twice. Then the next two rows are the same as the first two. So the output is the input grid repeated twice in rows and columns. So for a 2x2 input, the output is 4x4, which is the input grid expanded by 2x2.\n\nSimilarly, example 3: input is 2x2. Output is 4x4. The input is:\n\n0 3\n\n3 0\n\nOutput:\n\n0 3 0 3\n\n3 0 3 0\n\n0 3 0 3\n\n3 0 3 0\n\nSo the same pattern. Each row of the input is duplicated twice, and each element is duplicated twice. So the output is the input grid expanded by 2x2. So for example, the first row of input is [0,3], and the first row of output is [0,3,0,3], which is the original row repeated twice. Then the next row is [3,0] repeated twice. Then the same again.\n\nSo this seems to be a pattern where the input grid is expanded by a factor of 3 in example 1, 2 in example 2 and 3. Wait, example 1's input is 3x3, output is 9x9. So the expansion factor is 3. So for example 1, the input is expanded by 3x3. For example 2 and 3, it's 2x2. But example 4's input is 3x3, and output is 9x9. Let's check example 4.\n\nExample 4 input is:\n\n0 0 8\n\n8 8 8\n\n8 0 0\n\nOutput is 9x9. Let's look at the first row of input: [0,0,8]. The first row of output is [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8]. So that's the original row repeated three times. Then the second row of input is [8,8,8], which in the output is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. Then the third row of input is [8,0,0], which becomes [8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0]. Then the next three rows are the same as the first three. So the output is the input rows repeated three times, and each row is duplicated three times. So the expansion factor is 3.\n\nSo for example 1, 4, and 5, the input is 3x3 and output is 9x9. So that's 3x3 expansion. But example 2 and 3 are 2x2 input, output 4x4. So the expansion factor is 2. But example 5 is input 4x4 (since the input is 4 rows, each with 4 elements), and output is 16x16? Wait, looking at example 5's input:\n\nInput is:\n\n0 0 2 0\n\n2 0 2 0\n\n0 2 0 2\n\n2 2 2 0\n\nSo that's 4 rows, each with 4 elements. The output is 16x16. So the output is 16 rows, each with 16 elements. So that's 4x4 expansion. So the expansion factor is 4. So the pattern seems to be that the input grid is expanded by a factor of N, where N is the size of the input grid. For example, if the input is 3x3, then output is 9x9. If input is 2x2, output is 4x4. If input is 4x4, output is 16x16.\n\nSo the general idea is that the output grid is the input grid expanded by a factor of K, where K is the size of the input grid. So for example, if the input is a grid of size M x N, then the output is (M*K) x (N*K), where K is the original size. Wait, but in the examples, the input is square. For example, example 1 is 3x3, example 2 is 2x2, example 3 is 2x2, example 4 is 3x3, example 5 is 4x4. So perhaps the expansion factor is the same as the original grid's size. So for a grid of size M x M (since all examples have square grids), the output is M*M x M*M. But how?\n\nWait, in example 2, the input is 2x2. The output is 4x4. So the expansion factor is 2. So the output is the input grid replicated in a way that each cell is repeated in a grid. For example, the output is the input grid tiled in a 2x2 pattern. So for each cell in the input, it's repeated in a 2x2 block. Then the entire output is the input grid tiled in a 2x2 pattern. So for example, the input is 2x2, and the output is 4x4, which is the input grid replicated in 2x2 blocks.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the output as being generated by taking each cell in the input grid and replicating it in a K x K block, where K is the original grid's size. For example, if the input is 3x3, then each cell is replicated in a 3x3 block, and the entire output is the input grid tiled in 3x3 blocks. But that would make the output 3x3 times larger. Wait, but that would be 3x3 times the original grid. So for example, if the input is 3x3, the output is 9x9. Which matches example 1, 4, etc.\n\nSo the transformation is to take each cell in the input grid and replicate it in a K x K block, where K is the original grid's size. Then the output is the input grid tiled in K x K blocks. So for example, the input is a grid of size M x M. The output is a grid of size M*M x M*M. Each cell (i,j) in the input is replicated in a block of size M x M. So the output grid is formed by tiling the input grid in a way that each cell is repeated M times in each direction.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's think of the input grid as a 2D array. The output grid is a 2D array where each cell (i,j) in the output is equal to the cell (i//K, j//K) in the input, where K is the original grid's size. Wait, no. Because for example, in example 2, the input is 2x2. The output is 4x4. So for output cell (0,0), it's the same as input (0,0). For output (0,1), it's input (0,0) again? Wait, no. Looking at example 2's input:\n\nInput is:\n\nRow 0: 1 0\n\nRow 1: 1 1\n\nOutput is:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 1: 1 1 1 1\n\nRow 2: 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 3: 1 1 1 1\n\nSo for output cell (0,0), it's input (0,0). For (0,1), it's input (0,1). For (0,2), it's input (0,0). For (0,3), input (0,1). So the output is generated by taking each row of the input and repeating it K times, where K is the original grid's size. Wait, but the original grid's size is 2. So for each row in the input, it's repeated K times. Then each row in the output is the input row repeated K times. But for example, the first row of the input is [1,0], and the first two rows of the output are [1,0,1,0] and [1,1,1,1]. So that's the input row repeated twice. So the output is the input grid's rows repeated K times, and each row is duplicated K times. So the output grid is formed by taking the input grid and tiling it in a K x K pattern. So for each row in the input, it's repeated K times, and each of those repeated rows is then repeated K times.\n\nWait, but that would make the output grid of size (M*K) x (N*K), where M and N are the original input dimensions. But in the examples, the input is square. So for example, input is 3x3, output is 9x9. So the output is generated by tiling the input grid in a K x K pattern, where K is the original grid's size.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each cell (i,j) in the output grid, the value is the same as the cell (i//K, j//K) in the input grid, where K is the original grid's size. Wait, but that's not the case. Let's take example 2. Input is 2x2. K is 2. For output cell (0,0), i//K is 0, j//K is 0. So input cell (0,0) is 1. Which matches. For output cell (0,1), i//K is 0, j//K is 0 (since 1//2=0). So input cell (0,0) is 1. But in the output, cell (0,1) is 0. Which is input (0,1). So that's not matching. So that approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by taking the input grid and replicating each cell in a K x K block. So for each cell (i,j) in the input, it's replicated in a block of K rows and K columns. So the output grid is formed by tiling the input grid in a K x K pattern. So the output grid is the input grid tiled K times in both directions. So the output grid is of size (M*K) x (N*K), where M and N are the original input dimensions.\n\nBut for example 2, input is 2x2, output is 4x4. So each cell in the input is replicated in a 2x2 block. So for output cell (0,0), it's input (0,0). For (0,1), it's input (0,1). For (1,0), it's input (1,0). For (1,1), it's input (1,1). Then the next block (rows 2-3, columns 0-1) is the same as the first block. So the output is the input grid tiled in 2x2 blocks. So the output grid is the input grid replicated K times in both directions.\n\nSo the way to generate the output is to take the input grid and for each row in the output, it is the input row repeated K times. Then, for each of those repeated rows, we repeat them K times. Wait, but that would make the output grid's rows be the input rows repeated K times, and then the entire output is that repeated K times. For example, for input 2x2:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow 0: [1, 0]\n\nRow 1: [1, 1]\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: [1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nRow 1: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow 2: [1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nRow 3: [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nWhich is the same as taking each row of the input and repeating it K times (K=2), and then repeating the entire set of rows K times. So the output is the input grid's rows repeated K times, and each row is repeated K times.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\n- Let K be the size of the input grid (number of rows, which is same as number of columns since all examples are square).\n\n- The output grid is K*K in size.\n\n- For each row in the output, it is the input row repeated K times.\n\n- Then, the entire output grid is the input rows repeated K times.\n\nWait, but that would make the output grid have K*K rows, each row being K times the input row. So for example, input is 2x2, K=2. So output has 2*2=4 rows. Each row is the input row repeated 2 times. So row 0 is [1,0,1,0], row 1 is [1,1,1,1], row 2 is same as row 0, row 3 same as row 1. Which matches example 2.\n\nSimilarly, example 1: input is 3x3. K=3. Output is 3*3=9 rows. Each row is the input row repeated 3 times. So the first row of input is [2,0,2], so the first three rows of the output are [2,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,2], and so on.\n\nBut looking at example 1's output, the first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2\n\nRow 1: 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\n\nRow 2: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThen the next three rows are the same as the first three. Then again the same. So the output is the input rows repeated K times (3 times), and each row is the input row repeated K times (3 times). So that's the pattern.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each row in the input, create a new row in the output by repeating the input row K times, where K is the original grid's size. Then, repeat this entire set of rows K times.\n\nSo for example, if the input is a 3x3 grid, the output is a 9x9 grid where each row is the input row repeated 3 times, and the entire set of rows is repeated 3 times.\n\nSo how to implement this in code?\n\nFirst, determine K, which is the size of the input grid. For example, if the input is a 3x3 grid, K=3.\n\nThen, for each row in the input, create a new row in the output by repeating the input row K times. Then, repeat this entire set of rows K times.\n\nSo for example, for input rows:\n\nrow0 = [a, b, c]\n\nrow1 = [d, e, f]\n\nrow2 = [g, h, i]\n\nThen, for K=3, each row is repeated 3 times. So the first row in the output would be [a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c]. Then the second row would be [d, e, f, d, e, f, d, e, f], and third row [g, h, i, g, h, i, g, h, i]. Then, the next three rows are the same as the first three, and so on, for K times.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    K = len(grid)\n    # Create the expanded rows\n    expanded_rows = []\n    for row in grid:\n        expanded_row = row * K\n        expanded_rows.append(expanded_row)\n    # Now repeat the expanded_rows K times\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for _ in range(K):\n        transformed_grid.extend(expanded_rows)\n    return transformed_grid\n\nWait, but in example 2, the input is 2x2. The output is 4x4. So for K=2, the code would take each row of the input, repeat it K=2 times, then repeat the entire list of expanded rows K=2 times. So for the input rows [1,0] and [1,1], the expanded_rows would be [1,0,1,0] and [1,1,1,1]. Then, the transformed grid is the expanded_rows repeated 2 times, so the output is:\n\n[1,0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n\n[1,0,1,0]\n\n[1,1,1,1]\n\nWhich matches example 2. Similarly, example 3's input is 2x2. The output is 4x4. So the code would generate the same as example 2, but with the input rows [0,3] and [3,0], which when expanded would be [0,3,0,3] and [3,0,3,0], then repeated twice. Which matches example 3.\n\nBut wait, example 4's input is 3x3. The output is 9x9. Let's check. For example, the first row of input is [0,0,8]. Repeating it 3 times would be [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,8], which matches the first row of the output. The second row of input is [8,8,8], which when repeated 3 times is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], which matches the second row of the output. The third row is [8,0,0], repeated 3 times is [8,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0], which matches the third row of the output. Then the next three rows are the same as the first three. Which matches example 4.\n\nSo this seems to work for all examples. Let's check example 5.\n\nExample 5's input is 4x4. The output is 16x16. So K=4. Each row is repeated 4 times, then the entire expanded_rows is repeated 4 times. So for the first row of input, which is [0,0,2,0], repeated 4 times would be [0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0]. Which matches the first row of the output. The second row of input is [2,0,2,0], repeated 4 times would be [2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0], which matches the second row of the output. The third row of input is [0,2,0,2], repeated 4 times would be [0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2], which matches the third row of the output. The fourth row of input is [2,2,2,0], repeated 4 times would be [2,2,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,0], which matches the fourth row of the output. Then the next four rows are the same as the first four. So the output is 16 rows, each 16 elements. Which matches example 5.\n\nSo this approach seems to work for all examples. So the code is to take each row of the input, repeat it K times (where K is the size of the input grid), then repeat the entire list of expanded rows K times.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    K = len(grid)\n    expanded_rows = []\n    for row in grid:\n        expanded_row = row * K\n        expanded_rows.append(expanded_row)\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for _ in range(K):\n        transformed_grid.extend(expanded_rows)\n    return transformed_grid\n\nBut wait, the input is a 2D list. For example, in example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is 9x9. So the code would generate a list of 9 rows, each of 9 elements. Which is correct.\n\nBut let's test for example 2. The input is a 2x2 grid. So K=2. The code would generate 2 rows of expanded rows (each row is the input row repeated 2 times). Then, the transformed grid is those two rows repeated 2 times, resulting in 4 rows. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about the test input? The test input is:\n\n0 8 8 0 0\n\n8 8 8 8 8\n\n0 8 8 0 0\n\n8 8 8 8 8\n\n0 8 8 0 8\n\nSo the input is a 5x5 grid. So K=5. So each row is repeated 5 times. Then the entire list of expanded rows is repeated 5 times. So the output would be 25x25.\n\nBut the code would generate that. So the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach. The pattern is that the output is the input grid expanded by K times in both dimensions, where K is the original grid's size.\n\nTherefore, the Python function is as described.\n"
