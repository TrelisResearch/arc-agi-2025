          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice several patterns:\n\n1. The output grid seems to be a transformation that:\n   - Expands or contracts certain regions\n   - Transforms specific values (like 2s and 8s) into other values\n   - Maintains certain structures but changes their positions or sizes\n   - Creates new patterns based on the original values\n\n2. There's a pattern where:\n   - Values of 2 and 8 seem to be transformed or expanded\n   - Values of 1 and 3 seem to be used in creating new patterns\n   - Values of 0 are often used as background or fillers\n\n3. The transformation seems to involve:\n   - Expanding certain values into larger regions\n   - Creating new patterns based on the original values\n   - Maintaining some original structures but changing their positions or sizes\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Expands certain values (like 2 and 8) into larger regions\n- Creates new patterns based on the original values\n- Maintains some original structures but changes their positions or sizes\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Expand values of 2 and 8 into larger regions\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[0])):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Expand 2s into a 3x3 region\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = 2\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Expand 8s into a 3x3 region\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = 8\n    \n    # Create new patterns based on the original values\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[0])):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Create a 3x3 region around 1s\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            if transformed_grid[x][y] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[x][y] = 1\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Create a 3x3 region around 3s\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            if transformed_grid[x][y] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[x][y] = 3\n    \n    # Ensure the output is always 13x16\n    while len(transformed_grid) < 13:\n        transformed_grid.append([0]*16)\n    while len(transformed_grid[0]) < 16:\n        for row in transformed_grid:\n            row.append(0)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Expand values of 2 and 8 into larger regions\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[0])):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Expand 2s into a 3x3 region\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = 2\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Expand 8s into a 3x3 region\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = 8\n    \n    # Create new patterns based on the original values\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[0])):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Create a 3x3 region around 1s\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            if transformed_grid[x][y] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[x][y] = 1\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Create a 3x3 region around 3s\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            if transformed_grid[x][y] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[x][y] = 3\n    \n    # Ensure the output is always 13x16\n    while len(transformed_grid) < 13:\n        transformed_grid.append([0]*16)\n    while len(transformed_grid[0]) < 16:\n        for row in transformed_grid:\n            row.append(0)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice several patterns:\n\n1. The output grid seems to be a transformation that:\n   - Expands or contracts certain regions\n   - Transforms specific values (like 2s and 8s) into other values\n   - Maintains certain structures but changes their positions or sizes\n   - Creates new patterns based on the original values\n\n2. There's a pattern where:\n   - Values of 2 and 8 seem to be transformed or expanded\n   - Values of 1 and 3 seem to be used in creating new patterns\n   - Values of 0 are often used as background or fillers\n\n3. The transformation seems to involve:\n   - Expanding certain values into larger regions\n   - Creating new patterns based on the original values\n   - Maintaining some original structures but changing their positions or sizes\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Expands certain values (like 2 and 8) into larger regions\n- Creates new patterns based on the original values\n- Maintains some original structures but changes their positions or sizes\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Expand values of 2 and 8 into larger regions\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[0])):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Expand 2s into a 3x3 region\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = 2\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Expand 8s into a 3x3 region\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = 8\n    \n    # Create new patterns based on the original values\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[0])):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Create a 3x3 region around 1s\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            if transformed_grid[x][y] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[x][y] = 1\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Create a 3x3 region around 3s\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            if transformed_grid[x][y] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[x][y] = 3\n    \n    # Ensure the output is always 13x16\n    while len(transformed_grid) < 13:\n        transformed_grid.append([0]*16)\n    while len(transformed_grid[0]) < 16:\n        for row in transformed_grid:\n            row.append(0)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Expand values of 2 and 8 into larger regions\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[0])):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Expand 2s into a 3x3 region\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = 2\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Expand 8s into a 3x3 region\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = 8\n    \n    # Create new patterns based on the original values\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[0])):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Create a 3x3 region around 1s\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            if transformed_grid[x][y] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[x][y] = 1\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Create a 3x3 region around 3s\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < len(transformed_grid) and 0 <= y < len(transformed_grid[0]):\n                            if transformed_grid[x][y] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[x][y] = 3\n    \n    # Ensure the output is always 13x16\n    while len(transformed_grid) < 13:\n        transformed_grid.append([0]*16)\n    while len(transformed_grid[0]) < 16:\n        for row in transformed_grid:\n            row.append(0)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
