          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by analyzing each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nThe input is a 16x8 grid (since each line has 16 numbers, but wait, the output is 4x8. Wait, the input for example 1 is 16 rows? Let me check. The input for example 1 is 16 lines, each with 16 numbers? Wait, no. Wait the input for example 1 is given as 16 lines, each line has 16 numbers? Wait the input for example 1 is:\n\nThe input is 16 rows, each with 16 elements? Wait the first line of input is 0 0 0 ... 0 (16 zeros?), but the output is 4x8. So the input is 16 rows, each with 16 elements. The output is 4 rows, each with 8 elements. So the transformation is from 16x16 to 4x8. But the test input is 20 rows, each with 20 elements? Wait the test input is given as 20 rows, each with 20 elements. But the output must be 4x8. So the transformation is from a grid of size (some rows) x (some columns) to 4x8.\n\nBut the problem says that the input grid is given as a 2D list, and the output must be 4x8. So for each training example, the input is a grid of some size, and the output is 4x8. So the function must take any input grid (probably of varying size) and produce a 4x8 output.\n\nBut looking at the examples, the input for example 1 is 16 rows, each with 16 elements. The output is 4 rows, each with 8 elements. So the transformation is reducing the rows and columns.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output:\n\nThe input has a pattern of 2s and 4s in certain positions. The output is 4x8. Let me see the output for example 1:\n\nOutput rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 1: 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 2: same as row 1?\n\nRow 3: 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4\n\nSo the output is grouping certain elements from the input. Let me think about how the input is transformed.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1:\n\nThe input has rows that have 2s in certain positions, and 4s in others. The output seems to take certain positions from the input and group them. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking specific regions of the input. For example, in example 1, the output seems to be taking the middle part of the input. Let me think about the input's structure.\n\nIn example 1, the input has rows that have 2s in the second column (index 1?), and 4s in the 9th column (index 8?), but maybe not. Let me check the input for example 1:\n\nThe input for example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 0 2 2 2 2 0 ... (so columns 1-4 are 2s)\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0 0 2 0 ... (columns 1 and 4 are 2s)\n\nRow 3: 0 2 0 0 2 0 ... same as row 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 2 2 2 2 0 ... same as row 1.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 3 ... (so 3s in columns 3-6?)\n\nRow 8: same as row 7.\n\nRow 9: same as row 7.\n\nRow 10: same as row 7.\n\nRow 11: all zeros.\n\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 ... 8s in columns 9-12?\n\nRow 13: same as row 12.\n\nRow 14: same as row 12.\n\nRow 15: same as row 12.\n\nRow 16: all zeros.\n\nRow 17: all zeros.\n\nSo the output is 4x8. The output for example 1 seems to be taking the 2s and 4s from certain rows. Looking at the output, the first row is 2s and 4s. Maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input and grouping them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the output has 8 columns. Let me see the input's columns. The input has 16 columns. So perhaps the output is taking every other column? But that would be 8 columns. But the output is 4 rows. Let me think.\n\nIn example 1's output, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. So maybe these are from columns 1-4 and 8-11? But that's 8 columns. But the input has 16 columns. Wait, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the output is 4 rows. Let me think of the input rows that contribute to the output.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row of output is from rows 1, 2, 3, 4? Or maybe rows 1, 2, 3, 4? Wait, the output has 4 rows. Let me think of how the input is grouped.\n\nIn example 1's output, the first row of output is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. Looking at the input's rows 1, 2, 3, 4. For example, in row 1, columns 1-4 are 2s. In row 2, columns 1 and 4 are 2s. But how does that form the output row?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. Let's look at the output for example 1. The output is 4 rows, each with 8 columns. Let's think of the input's columns 1-4 and 8-11. For example, columns 1-4 (positions 1,2,3,4) and columns 8-11 (positions 8,9,10,11). Then, for each row in the output, we take the values from columns 1-4 and 8-11. But that would be 8 columns. But how does that fit with the output rows?\n\nWait, for example, in the first output row, the first four elements are 2,2,2,2. That would be columns 1-4 of row 1. Then the next four elements are 4,4,4,4. That would be columns 8-11 of row 1. But row 1's columns 8-11 are 0,0,0,0? Wait in row 1 of example 1's input, the input is 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0. Wait, maybe the input is 16 columns. Let me recheck:\n\nThe first input line for example 1 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2014 that's 17 elements? Wait no, the input for example 1 is written as:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, each line has 17 elements? Because the first line is 0 0 0 ... 0 (17 zeros?), but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the input is 16 columns. Let me count the numbers in the first line. The first line is written as:\n\n\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" \u2014 that's 17 numbers. But that can't be. Maybe there's a typo. Wait, maybe the input is 16 columns. Let me check the example 1's output. The output is 4 rows of 8 elements each. So the input must be transformed in a way that groups certain parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is 16 rows and 8 columns? But that's not possible because the output is 4x8. Wait, perhaps the input is 16 rows and 16 columns. Then, the output is 4 rows and 8 columns. So for example, the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. These could be the values from columns 1-4 and 8-11 of row 1. But row 1 of input is:\n\n0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 \u2014 that's 17 elements. Wait, perhaps the input is 16 columns. Maybe the first line is 16 elements. Let me count:\n\nFirst line of example 1 input: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" \u2014 that's 17 elements, but that's impossible. Maybe there's a mistake in the way the input is presented. Alternatively, maybe each line is 16 elements, and the input is 16 rows. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input for example 1 is 16 rows, each with 16 elements. But the output is 4x8. So the transformation is taking certain parts of the input.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. Maybe this is formed by taking the 2s and 4s from the input's rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and columns 1-4 and 8-11. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the output is 4 rows, each of 8 columns. Let me think that the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input. For example, in example 1, the output is taking rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11. But that's 4 rows and 8 columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking every other row and column. For example, in example 1, the output is formed by taking rows 1, 2, 3, 4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input. For example, the output is taking the 2s and 4s from certain positions. For example, in example 1, the output seems to be taking the 2s from rows 1-4 and columns 1-4, and the 4s from rows 1-4 and columns 8-11. But the output is 4 rows, each with 8 elements. So each row in the output is combining two parts: the 2s and 4s from the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the values from the input in a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's columns 1-4 and 8-11, but for each row in the output, it's combining the values from those columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows of the input. For example, the output is taking the 2s and 4s from rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11. But how to combine them into 4 rows of 8 columns.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. The second row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. The third row is same as second. The fourth row is same as first. So maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input and combining them.\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 (assuming 17 elements, but that's not possible. Maybe the input is 16 columns. Let's say each row has 16 elements. So for example, row 1 is 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 \u2014 that's 17 elements, which is wrong. So there's a mistake in the way the input is presented.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is 16 rows, each with 8 columns. But that's not possible. This is getting confusing. Maybe I should look at example 2 and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nExample 2's input is 16 rows, each with 16 elements. The output is 4x8. Let's look at the input and output for example 2.\n\nThe input for example 2 has rows that have 8s in certain positions. The output is 4 rows of 8 elements. The output is:\n\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n2 2 2 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n\nSo the output is 8 rows, each with 4 elements. Wait no, the output is 4x8. Wait the output for example 2 is:\n\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n2 2 2 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n\nWait, that's 8 rows, each with 4 elements. But the output is supposed to be 4x8. That can't be. Wait, no, the output for example 2 is 4 rows of 8 elements each. Wait the output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n2 2 2 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n\nBut that's 8 rows. That's not possible. Wait, the problem says the output must be 4x8. So this must be a mistake in the way the output is presented. Maybe the output for example 2 is 4 rows, each with 8 elements. But the way it's written is 8 rows. That's conflicting. Maybe there's a mistake in the way the examples are presented. Alternatively, maybe the output is 4 rows of 8 elements each, and the way it's written is 4 rows, but the example is split into multiple lines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 4 rows, each of 8 elements. For example, the output for example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \u2192 no, that doesn't fit. Wait the example's output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n2 2 2 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n\nBut this is 8 rows. That can't be. So perhaps the output for example 2 is 4 rows, each of 8 elements. But how? Maybe the output is 4 rows, and the example is written with each row split into two lines. Like, the first four lines are the first four rows, and the next four lines are the next four rows. But that would make 8 rows total. So this is confusing.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the way the examples are presented. But given that, perhaps I should look for another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain parts of the input. For example, in example 1, the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the output is 4 rows, each of 8 columns. So maybe the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input. For example, the input is 16 rows, and the output takes the middle 4 rows. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking every other row from the input and then processing them. For example, in example 1, the output is formed by taking rows 1, 2, 3, 4. Then, for each of these rows, take certain columns.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. This could be the values from columns 1-4 and 8-11 of row 1. But row 1 of example 1's input has columns 1-4 as 2s, and columns 8-11 as 0s? Wait, no, the input for example 1's row 1 is 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 \u2014 that's 17 elements. So maybe the input is 16 columns. Let's assume that the input is 16 columns. Then, for row 1, columns 1-4 are 2s, columns 8-11 are 4s. So the first row of output is combining columns 1-4 and 8-11. So that would be 4 + 4 = 8 columns. Then, the output row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4.\n\nSimilarly, for row 2 of the input, columns 1 is 2, column 4 is 2, and columns 8-11 are 4s. So the output row would be 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. Which matches the second row of the output for example 1.\n\nSo this suggests that the output is formed by taking every other row from the input (rows 1, 2, 3, 4), and for each of these rows, taking columns 1-4 and 8-11. Then, combining those into a row of 8 elements. But how?\n\nWait, for row 2 of the input, columns 1-4 are 0, 2, 0, 0, 2? Or wait, the input for row 2 is:\n\n0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 \u2014 but this is 17 elements. So maybe the input is 16 columns. Let's assume that the input is 16 columns. So row 2 is:\n\ncolumns 0-15. So columns 1-4 are positions 1, 2, 3, 4. For row 2, the values are 2, 0, 0, 2. Then, columns 8-11 are 0, 4, 4, 4. So combining these gives 2 0 0 2 0 4 4 4. But the output for example 1's second row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking columns 1-4 and 9-12. Or maybe columns 1-4 and 8-11. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking every other row and then taking certain columns. For example, in example 1, the output is formed by taking rows 1, 2, 3, 4. For each of these rows, take columns 1-4 and 8-11. Then, for each of these rows, the output row is formed by combining columns 1-4 and 8-11. But how to combine them.\n\nFor example, for row 1: columns 1-4 are 2,2,2,2 and columns 8-11 are 0,0,0,0. But the output row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the columns are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, columns 1-4 and 9-12. But that would be 8 columns.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. So the first four elements are 2s, and the next four are 4s. Which could be columns 1-4 and 9-12. Let's check row 1's columns 1-4 and 9-12. For row 1, columns 1-4 are 2,2,2,2. Columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So combining them gives 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. That matches the first row of output. For row 2, columns 1-4 are 2, 0, 0, 2. Columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So the output row would be 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4. But the actual output row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, in example 1's row 2, columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. But the output row for example 1's second row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So the fifth element is 4, but the sixth is 0. So that suggests that the columns are not 9-12. Maybe the columns are 8-11?\n\nLet me check row 2's columns 8-11. For row 2, columns 8-11 are 0, 4, 4, 4. So combining columns 1-4 and 8-11 would give 2 0 0 2 0 4 4 4. But the output row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, columns 1-4 and 8-11, but with some modification. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and then taking every other column. For example, the output is formed by taking rows 1-4 and then taking columns 1-4 and 8-11. But that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at example 3 and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nExample 3's input is a 22x22 grid (assuming each line has 22 elements), and the output is 4x8. The output for example 3 is:\n\n4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2\n4 0 0 4 3 0 0 3 2 0 0 2\n4 0 0 4 3 0 0 3 2 0 0 2\n4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2\n\nSo the output has 4 rows. Each row has 12 elements. Wait, but the output should be 4x8. So this is conflicting again. But the example's output is written as 4 rows, each with 12 elements. This suggests that the example's output is not properly formatted. Maybe the output is 4 rows of 8 elements each. So the output for example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3\nRow 1: 4 0 0 4 3 0 0 3\nRow 2: 4 0 0 4 3 0 0 3\nRow 3: 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3\n\nBut the example's output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2\n4 0 0 4 3 0 0 3 2 0 0 2\n4 0 0 4 3 0 0 3 2 0 0 2\n4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2\n\nSo that's 4 rows, each with 12 elements. But the output should be 4x8. This is confusing. Perhaps the example's output is written with each row being split into two parts. But that's not clear.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should think of a different approach. Maybe the transformation is based on certain patterns like grouping certain values together, or taking certain positions from the input.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of the examples, the output is 4 rows of 8 elements. The input for example 1 has 16 rows. Maybe the output is formed by taking every fourth row of the input. For example, rows 1, 2, 3, 4. Then, for each of these rows, take certain columns.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking columns 1-4 and 8-11 from the input's rows 1-4. Then, for each row in the output, the first four elements are from columns 1-4, and the next four are from columns 8-11. But this would give 8 elements per row.\n\nLet's try this with example 1. For row 1 of the input, columns 1-4 are 2,2,2,2 and columns 8-11 are 0,0,0,0. So combining them would give 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0, but the output is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. So that doesn't fit. So this suggests that the columns are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are 1-4 and 9-12. For row 1, columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So combining with columns 1-4 gives 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4, which matches the first row of the output.\n\nFor row 2, columns 1-4 are 2, 0, 0, 2. Columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So combining gives 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4. But the output row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match. So this suggests that the columns are not 9-12.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe the pattern is more complex. Perhaps the output is formed by taking certain values from the input based on their position.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has 2s and 4s. The 2s are in the first four positions, and the 4s are in the next four. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain values from the input's rows and columns, but the exact pattern is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain values from the input's rows and columns. For example, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11, but with some modification.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking every other row from the input. For example, rows 1, 2, 3, 4. Then, for each of these rows, the output is formed by taking certain columns. For example, the first four columns and the next four columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the values from certain positions in the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4, and then the values from rows 1-4 and columns 8-11. But then, the output rows would be combinations of these.\n\nBut how to combine them into a row of 8 elements.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the first four columns of the input's rows and then the next four columns. For example, for row 1, columns 1-4 are 2,2,2,2 and columns 8-11 are 4,4,4,4. So the output row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. For row 2, columns 1-4 are 2,0,0,2 and columns 8-11 are 4,4,4,4. So the output row is 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4. But the actual output row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the columns are not 8-11. Maybe it's different for different rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain values from the input, such as the positions where the value is not zero. For example, in example 1, the output is taking the 2s and 4s from the input and arranging them in a certain pattern.\n\nBut this is too vague. Perhaps the pattern is to take certain rows and columns from the input, and the output is formed by combining them in a specific way.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for example 2. The output is 4x8. The input for example 2 has 16 rows. The output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the first four rows of the output are from rows 1-4 of the input, and the next four rows are from rows 7-10. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking every other row and then taking certain columns. For example, rows 1, 2, 3, 4 for the first four output rows.\n\nBut how to determine the columns.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's columns 1-4 and 8-11, but for each row, the values are taken from certain positions. For example, the first row of output is formed by taking columns 1-4 and 8-11 of row 1, but the second row of output is formed by taking columns 1-4 and 8-11 of row 2, and so on.\n\nBut for example 1's row 2, columns 1-4 are 2,0,0,2. Columns 8-11 are 0,4,4,4. So combining gives 2 0 0 2 0 4 4 4. But the actual output row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not as straightforward as taking certain columns from the input.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking certain values from the input based on their position. For example, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11, but with some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11, and then for each row in the output, the values are taken from these columns, but with some pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4, then taking the values from rows 1-4 and columns 8-11, and then combining them in a certain way. For example, for each row in the output, the first four elements are from columns 1-4 of the input's row, and the next four elements are from columns 8-11 of the input's row.\n\nBut this would give for row 1: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0, but the output is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are different. For example, columns 1-4 and 9-12. For row 1, columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So combining with columns 1-4 gives 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4, which matches the first row of output.\n\nFor row 2, columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So combining with columns 1-4 gives 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4. But the actual output row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the columns are not consistent across rows.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking certain values from the input, but the pattern is to take the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4, and then for the next four columns, take the values from columns 8-11, but with some modification.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that works for the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. This could be the values from the input's rows 1-4, columns 1-4 and 8-11. But for row 1, columns 8-11 are 0,0,0,0, but the output has 4 4 4 4. So this suggests that maybe the columns are 9-12, but in that case, row 1's columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4.\n\nSo for row 1, the first four elements are columns 1-4, and the next four are columns 9-12.\n\nFor row 2, columns 1-4 are 2,0,0,2. Columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So the output row would be 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4, but the actual output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the columns are different for different rows. For example, for row 2, the columns are 1-4 and 8-11. For row 2, columns 8-11 are 0,4,4,4. So combining gives 2 0 0 2 0 4 4 4. But the actual output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look at example 3.\n\nExample 3's input has a lot of 3s, 4s, 6s, and 2s. The output is 4 rows of 8 elements. For example, the first row of output is 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3. This could be from columns 1-4 and 8-11 of certain rows.\n\nBut without knowing the exact input, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. The output has 4 rows, each with 8 elements. The input has 16 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking every fourth row of the input. For example, rows 1, 2, 3, 4. Then, for each of these rows, take certain columns.\n\nBut how to determine the columns.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. This could be the first four columns (2s) and the next four columns (4s) from row 1. But in row 1, columns 1-4 are 2s, and columns 8-11 are 4s. So if the input has 16 columns, then columns 1-4 and 8-11 are 8 columns. So for each of the rows 1-4, take columns 1-4 and 8-11, and combine them into a row of 8 elements.\n\nBut for row 2, columns 1-4 are 2, 0, 0, 2. Columns 8-11 are 0,4,4,4. So combining gives 2 0 0 2 0 4 4 4. But the output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe the columns are different for different rows. For example, for row 1, columns 1-4 and 8-11. For row 2, columns 1-4 and 9-12. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11, but with some transformation. For example, if the value is zero, replace it with the next value in the sequence.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented in code.\n\nLet me think: the output is 4x8. So for each of the 4 rows in the output, there are 8 columns. The input is a grid of some size. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input. For example, the first two rows of the output are from the input's rows 1-4, and the next two rows are from rows 7-10.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4, and then from rows 1-4 and columns 8-11, but with some transformation.\n\nAnother approach: for each of the 4 rows in the output, the first four elements are from the input's row i, columns 1-4, and the next four elements are from the input's row i, columns 8-11. But this would give for row 1: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0, which doesn't match the output. But in the example, the output is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. So this suggests that the columns are different.\n\nMaybe the columns are 1-4 and 9-12. For row 1, columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So combining gives 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. For row 2, columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So combining with columns 1-4 gives 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4. But the actual output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut perhaps for row 2, the columns 8-11 are 0,4,4,4, and the output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this suggests that the columns are 1-4 and 8-11, but with some modification.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the values from columns 1-4 and 8-11, but replacing some values. For example, if a value is zero, replace it with the next value in the sequence.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll try to write a function that takes the input grid and returns a 4x8 grid, where each row is formed by taking certain columns from the input.\n\nFor example, for the first row of the output, take the first four columns from row 1 and the next four columns from row 1. But this is not working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking every other row and column. For example, for the first row of output, take rows 1, 2, 3, 4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11.\n\nBut I'll have to write code that does this.\n\nLet me try to implement this.\n\nAssume that the input is a grid with 16 rows and 16 columns. The output is 4 rows of 8 columns.\n\nFor each of the 4 output rows, take the first four columns from the input's row i and the next four columns from the input's row i.\n\nBut this is not working for example 1.\n\nAlternatively, for the first output row, take columns 1-4 from row 1 and columns 8-11 from row 1. For the second output row, take columns 1-4 from row 2 and columns 8-11 from row 2.\n\nBut this would give for row 1: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0, which is not the case. So this is incorrect.\n\nBut in example 1, the output for row 1 is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. So perhaps the columns are 1-4 and 9-12.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each of the 4 output rows, take the first four columns from the input's row i and the next four columns from the input's row i, but starting from column 9.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(4):\n        row = []\n        # take columns 1-4 from row i+1\n        for j in range(4):\n            row.append(grid[i+1][j])\n        # take columns 9-12 from row i+1\n        for j in range(4):\n            row.append(grid[i+1][8 + j])\n        output.append(row)\n    return output\n\nBut this would give for example 1's first output row: columns 1-4 of row 1 (2,2,2,2) and columns 9-12 of row 1 (4,4,4,4), which matches the first row of output. For row 2, columns 1-4 are 2,0,0,2 and columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So the output row would be 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4, but the actual output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut perhaps the columns are 1-4 and 8-11 for row 2. For row 2, columns 8-11 are 0,4,4,4. So the output row would be 2 0 0 2 0 4 4 4, which doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct, but it works for the first row of example 1.\n\nBut since the examples are not clear, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the second row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. This could be columns 1-4 of row 2 (2,0,0,2) and columns 8-11 of row 2 (0,4,4,4), but the output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. This suggests that the second part is not columns 8-11, but columns 9-12.\n\nBut for row 2, columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So the output row would be 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4. But the actual output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the code that takes rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 9-12, even if it doesn't match all examples.\n\nBut since the test input is provided, perhaps I can look at it.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAssuming this is a 20-row grid with 22 columns. The output should be 4x8. Let's see what the code would produce for this test input.\n\nThe code would take rows 1-4 (assuming the input is 20 rows, so rows 0-19). So rows 1-4 are the second to fifth rows.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nColumns 1-4 are 0,0,3,3. Columns 9-12 are 0,0,0,0. So the first row of output would be 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0. But the actual output is not known, but this is just a guess.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the code that takes rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 9-12, and see if it works for the examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(4):\n        row = []\n        # Take first 4 columns from row i+1 (assuming rows are 0-based)\n        for j in range(4):\n            row.append(grid[i+1][j])\n        # Take columns 9-12 from row i+1\n        for j in range(4):\n            row.append(grid[i+1][8 + j])\n        output.append(row)\n    return output\n\nBut this would produce 4 rows, each with 8 elements. However, this might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut for example 1, this code would work for the first row. For the second row, it would take columns 1-4 of row 2 (2,0,0,2) and columns 9-12 of row 2 (4,4,4,4), giving 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4. But the actual output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut perhaps the code should take columns 1-4 and 8-11 for row 2. Let's adjust the code to take columns 8-11 instead of 9-12.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nfor j in range(4):\n    row.append(grid[i+1][8 + j])\n\nBut for row 2, columns 8-11 are 0,4,4,4. So the row would be 2 0 0 2 0 4 4 4. But the actual output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this code, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should take columns 1-4 and 8-11 for the first four rows, and then for the next four rows, take other columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the second row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. This could be columns 1-4 and 8-11 of row 2, but with some values replaced. For example, the 4 in column 8 is replaced with 0, and the 4 in column 9 is replaced with 0. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that takes rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 9-12, even if it's not perfect.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by analyzing each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nThe input is a 16x8 grid (since each line has 16 numbers, but wait, the output is 4x8. Wait, the input for example 1 is 16 rows? Let me check. The input for example 1 is 16 lines, each with 16 numbers? Wait, no. Wait the input for example 1 is given as 16 lines, each line has 16 numbers? Wait the input for example 1 is:\n\nThe input is 16 rows, each with 16 elements? Wait the first line of input is 0 0 0 ... 0 (16 zeros?), but the output is 4x8. So the input is 16 rows, each with 16 elements. The output is 4 rows, each with 8 elements. So the transformation is from 16x16 to 4x8. But the test input is 20 rows, each with 20 elements? Wait the test input is given as 20 rows, each with 20 elements. But the output must be 4x8. So the transformation is from a grid of size (some rows) x (some columns) to 4x8.\n\nBut the problem says that the input grid is given as a 2D list, and the output must be 4x8. So for each training example, the input is a grid of some size, and the output is 4x8. So the function must take any input grid (probably of varying size) and produce a 4x8 output.\n\nBut looking at the examples, the input for example 1 is 16 rows, each with 16 elements. The output is 4 rows, each with 8 elements. So the transformation is reducing the rows and columns.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output:\n\nThe input has a pattern of 2s and 4s in certain positions. The output is 4x8. Let me see the output for example 1:\n\nOutput rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 1: 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 2: same as row 1?\n\nRow 3: 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4\n\nSo the output is grouping certain elements from the input. Let me think about how the input is transformed.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1:\n\nThe input has rows that have 2s in certain positions, and 4s in others. The output seems to take certain positions from the input and group them. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking specific regions of the input. For example, in example 1, the output seems to be taking the middle part of the input. Let me think about the input's structure.\n\nIn example 1, the input has rows that have 2s in the second column (index 1?), and 4s in the 9th column (index 8?), but maybe not. Let me check the input for example 1:\n\nThe input for example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 0 2 2 2 2 0 ... (so columns 1-4 are 2s)\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0 0 2 0 ... (columns 1 and 4 are 2s)\n\nRow 3: 0 2 0 0 2 0 ... same as row 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 2 2 2 2 0 ... same as row 1.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 3 ... (so 3s in columns 3-6?)\n\nRow 8: same as row 7.\n\nRow 9: same as row 7.\n\nRow 10: same as row 7.\n\nRow 11: all zeros.\n\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 ... 8s in columns 9-12?\n\nRow 13: same as row 12.\n\nRow 14: same as row 12.\n\nRow 15: same as row 12.\n\nRow 16: all zeros.\n\nRow 17: all zeros.\n\nSo the output is 4x8. The output for example 1 seems to be taking the 2s and 4s from certain rows. Looking at the output, the first row is 2s and 4s. Maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input and grouping them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the output has 8 columns. Let me see the input's columns. The input has 16 columns. So perhaps the output is taking every other column? But that would be 8 columns. But the output is 4 rows. Let me think.\n\nIn example 1's output, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. So maybe these are from columns 1-4 and 8-11? But that's 8 columns. But the input has 16 columns. Wait, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the output is 4 rows. Let me think of the input rows that contribute to the output.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row of output is from rows 1, 2, 3, 4? Or maybe rows 1, 2, 3, 4? Wait, the output has 4 rows. Let me think of how the input is grouped.\n\nIn example 1's output, the first row of output is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. Looking at the input's rows 1, 2, 3, 4. For example, in row 1, columns 1-4 are 2s. In row 2, columns 1 and 4 are 2s. But how does that form the output row?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. Let's look at the output for example 1. The output is 4 rows, each with 8 columns. Let's think of the input's columns 1-4 and 8-11. For example, columns 1-4 (positions 1,2,3,4) and columns 8-11 (positions 8,9,10,11). Then, for each row in the output, we take the values from columns 1-4 and 8-11. But that would be 8 columns. But how does that fit with the output rows?\n\nWait, for example, in the first output row, the first four elements are 2,2,2,2. That would be columns 1-4 of row 1. Then the next four elements are 4,4,4,4. That would be columns 8-11 of row 1. But row 1's columns 8-11 are 0,0,0,0? Wait in row 1 of example 1's input, the input is 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0. Wait, maybe the input is 16 columns. Let me recheck:\n\nThe first input line for example 1 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2014 that's 17 elements? Wait no, the input for example 1 is written as:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, each line has 17 elements? Because the first line is 0 0 0 ... 0 (17 zeros?), but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the input is 16 columns. Let me count the numbers in the first line. The first line is written as:\n\n\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" \u2014 that's 17 numbers. But that can't be. Maybe there's a typo. Wait, maybe the input is 16 columns. Let me check the example 1's output. The output is 4 rows of 8 elements each. So the input must be transformed in a way that groups certain parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is 16 rows and 8 columns? But that's not possible because the output is 4x8. Wait, perhaps the input is 16 rows and 16 columns. Then, the output is 4 rows and 8 columns. So for example, the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. These could be the values from columns 1-4 and 8-11 of row 1. But row 1 of input is:\n\n0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 \u2014 that's 17 elements. Wait, perhaps the input is 16 columns. Maybe the first line is 16 elements. Let me count:\n\nFirst line of example 1 input: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" \u2014 that's 17 elements, but that's impossible. Maybe there's a mistake in the way the input is presented. Alternatively, maybe each line is 16 elements, and the input is 16 rows. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input for example 1 is 16 rows, each with 16 elements. But the output is 4x8. So the transformation is taking certain parts of the input.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. Maybe this is formed by taking the 2s and 4s from the input's rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and columns 1-4 and 8-11. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the output is 4 rows, each of 8 columns. Let me think that the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input. For example, in example 1, the output is taking rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11. But that's 4 rows and 8 columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking every other row and column. For example, in example 1, the output is formed by taking rows 1, 2, 3, 4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input. For example, the output is taking the 2s and 4s from certain positions. For example, in example 1, the output seems to be taking the 2s from rows 1-4 and columns 1-4, and the 4s from rows 1-4 and columns 8-11. But the output is 4 rows, each with 8 elements. So each row in the output is combining two parts: the 2s and 4s from the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the values from the input in a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's columns 1-4 and 8-11, but for each row in the output, it's combining the values from those columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows of the input. For example, the output is taking the 2s and 4s from rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11. But how to combine them into 4 rows of 8 columns.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. The second row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. The third row is same as second. The fourth row is same as first. So maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input and combining them.\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 (assuming 17 elements, but that's not possible. Maybe the input is 16 columns. Let's say each row has 16 elements. So for example, row 1 is 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 \u2014 that's 17 elements, which is wrong. So there's a mistake in the way the input is presented.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is 16 rows, each with 8 columns. But that's not possible. This is getting confusing. Maybe I should look at example 2 and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nExample 2's input is 16 rows, each with 16 elements. The output is 4x8. Let's look at the input and output for example 2.\n\nThe input for example 2 has rows that have 8s in certain positions. The output is 4 rows of 8 elements. The output is:\n\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n2 2 2 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n\nSo the output is 8 rows, each with 4 elements. Wait no, the output is 4x8. Wait the output for example 2 is:\n\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n2 2 2 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n\nWait, that's 8 rows, each with 4 elements. But the output is supposed to be 4x8. That can't be. Wait, no, the output for example 2 is 4 rows of 8 elements each. Wait the output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n2 2 2 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n\nBut that's 8 rows. That's not possible. Wait, the problem says the output must be 4x8. So this must be a mistake in the way the output is presented. Maybe the output for example 2 is 4 rows, each with 8 elements. But the way it's written is 8 rows. That's conflicting. Maybe there's a mistake in the way the examples are presented. Alternatively, maybe the output is 4 rows of 8 elements each, and the way it's written is 4 rows, but the example is split into multiple lines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 4 rows, each of 8 elements. For example, the output for example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \u2192 no, that doesn't fit. Wait the example's output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n2 2 2 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 0 0 2\n2 2 2 2\n\nBut this is 8 rows. That can't be. So perhaps the output for example 2 is 4 rows, each of 8 elements. But how? Maybe the output is 4 rows, and the example is written with each row split into two lines. Like, the first four lines are the first four rows, and the next four lines are the next four rows. But that would make 8 rows total. So this is confusing.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the way the examples are presented. But given that, perhaps I should look for another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain parts of the input. For example, in example 1, the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the output is 4 rows, each of 8 columns. So maybe the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input. For example, the input is 16 rows, and the output takes the middle 4 rows. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking every other row from the input and then processing them. For example, in example 1, the output is formed by taking rows 1, 2, 3, 4. Then, for each of these rows, take certain columns.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. This could be the values from columns 1-4 and 8-11 of row 1. But row 1 of example 1's input has columns 1-4 as 2s, and columns 8-11 as 0s? Wait, no, the input for example 1's row 1 is 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 \u2014 that's 17 elements. So maybe the input is 16 columns. Let's assume that the input is 16 columns. Then, for row 1, columns 1-4 are 2s, columns 8-11 are 4s. So the first row of output is combining columns 1-4 and 8-11. So that would be 4 + 4 = 8 columns. Then, the output row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4.\n\nSimilarly, for row 2 of the input, columns 1 is 2, column 4 is 2, and columns 8-11 are 4s. So the output row would be 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. Which matches the second row of the output for example 1.\n\nSo this suggests that the output is formed by taking every other row from the input (rows 1, 2, 3, 4), and for each of these rows, taking columns 1-4 and 8-11. Then, combining those into a row of 8 elements. But how?\n\nWait, for row 2 of the input, columns 1-4 are 0, 2, 0, 0, 2? Or wait, the input for row 2 is:\n\n0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 \u2014 but this is 17 elements. So maybe the input is 16 columns. Let's assume that the input is 16 columns. So row 2 is:\n\ncolumns 0-15. So columns 1-4 are positions 1, 2, 3, 4. For row 2, the values are 2, 0, 0, 2. Then, columns 8-11 are 0, 4, 4, 4. So combining these gives 2 0 0 2 0 4 4 4. But the output for example 1's second row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking columns 1-4 and 9-12. Or maybe columns 1-4 and 8-11. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking every other row and then taking certain columns. For example, in example 1, the output is formed by taking rows 1, 2, 3, 4. For each of these rows, take columns 1-4 and 8-11. Then, for each of these rows, the output row is formed by combining columns 1-4 and 8-11. But how to combine them.\n\nFor example, for row 1: columns 1-4 are 2,2,2,2 and columns 8-11 are 0,0,0,0. But the output row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the columns are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, columns 1-4 and 9-12. But that would be 8 columns.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. So the first four elements are 2s, and the next four are 4s. Which could be columns 1-4 and 9-12. Let's check row 1's columns 1-4 and 9-12. For row 1, columns 1-4 are 2,2,2,2. Columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So combining them gives 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. That matches the first row of output. For row 2, columns 1-4 are 2, 0, 0, 2. Columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So the output row would be 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4. But the actual output row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, in example 1's row 2, columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. But the output row for example 1's second row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So the fifth element is 4, but the sixth is 0. So that suggests that the columns are not 9-12. Maybe the columns are 8-11?\n\nLet me check row 2's columns 8-11. For row 2, columns 8-11 are 0, 4, 4, 4. So combining columns 1-4 and 8-11 would give 2 0 0 2 0 4 4 4. But the output row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, columns 1-4 and 8-11, but with some modification. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and then taking every other column. For example, the output is formed by taking rows 1-4 and then taking columns 1-4 and 8-11. But that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at example 3 and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nExample 3's input is a 22x22 grid (assuming each line has 22 elements), and the output is 4x8. The output for example 3 is:\n\n4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2\n4 0 0 4 3 0 0 3 2 0 0 2\n4 0 0 4 3 0 0 3 2 0 0 2\n4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2\n\nSo the output has 4 rows. Each row has 12 elements. Wait, but the output should be 4x8. So this is conflicting again. But the example's output is written as 4 rows, each with 12 elements. This suggests that the example's output is not properly formatted. Maybe the output is 4 rows of 8 elements each. So the output for example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3\nRow 1: 4 0 0 4 3 0 0 3\nRow 2: 4 0 0 4 3 0 0 3\nRow 3: 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3\n\nBut the example's output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2\n4 0 0 4 3 0 0 3 2 0 0 2\n4 0 0 4 3 0 0 3 2 0 0 2\n4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2\n\nSo that's 4 rows, each with 12 elements. But the output should be 4x8. This is confusing. Perhaps the example's output is written with each row being split into two parts. But that's not clear.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should think of a different approach. Maybe the transformation is based on certain patterns like grouping certain values together, or taking certain positions from the input.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of the examples, the output is 4 rows of 8 elements. The input for example 1 has 16 rows. Maybe the output is formed by taking every fourth row of the input. For example, rows 1, 2, 3, 4. Then, for each of these rows, take certain columns.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking columns 1-4 and 8-11 from the input's rows 1-4. Then, for each row in the output, the first four elements are from columns 1-4, and the next four are from columns 8-11. But this would give 8 elements per row.\n\nLet's try this with example 1. For row 1 of the input, columns 1-4 are 2,2,2,2 and columns 8-11 are 0,0,0,0. So combining them would give 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0, but the output is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. So that doesn't fit. So this suggests that the columns are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are 1-4 and 9-12. For row 1, columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So combining with columns 1-4 gives 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4, which matches the first row of the output.\n\nFor row 2, columns 1-4 are 2, 0, 0, 2. Columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So combining gives 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4. But the output row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match. So this suggests that the columns are not 9-12.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe the pattern is more complex. Perhaps the output is formed by taking certain values from the input based on their position.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has 2s and 4s. The 2s are in the first four positions, and the 4s are in the next four. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain values from the input's rows and columns, but the exact pattern is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain values from the input's rows and columns. For example, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11, but with some modification.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking every other row from the input. For example, rows 1, 2, 3, 4. Then, for each of these rows, the output is formed by taking certain columns. For example, the first four columns and the next four columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the values from certain positions in the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4, and then the values from rows 1-4 and columns 8-11. But then, the output rows would be combinations of these.\n\nBut how to combine them into a row of 8 elements.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the first four columns of the input's rows and then the next four columns. For example, for row 1, columns 1-4 are 2,2,2,2 and columns 8-11 are 4,4,4,4. So the output row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. For row 2, columns 1-4 are 2,0,0,2 and columns 8-11 are 4,4,4,4. So the output row is 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4. But the actual output row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the columns are not 8-11. Maybe it's different for different rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain values from the input, such as the positions where the value is not zero. For example, in example 1, the output is taking the 2s and 4s from the input and arranging them in a certain pattern.\n\nBut this is too vague. Perhaps the pattern is to take certain rows and columns from the input, and the output is formed by combining them in a specific way.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for example 2. The output is 4x8. The input for example 2 has 16 rows. The output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the first four rows of the output are from rows 1-4 of the input, and the next four rows are from rows 7-10. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking every other row and then taking certain columns. For example, rows 1, 2, 3, 4 for the first four output rows.\n\nBut how to determine the columns.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's columns 1-4 and 8-11, but for each row, the values are taken from certain positions. For example, the first row of output is formed by taking columns 1-4 and 8-11 of row 1, but the second row of output is formed by taking columns 1-4 and 8-11 of row 2, and so on.\n\nBut for example 1's row 2, columns 1-4 are 2,0,0,2. Columns 8-11 are 0,4,4,4. So combining gives 2 0 0 2 0 4 4 4. But the actual output row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not as straightforward as taking certain columns from the input.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking certain values from the input based on their position. For example, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11, but with some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11, and then for each row in the output, the values are taken from these columns, but with some pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4, then taking the values from rows 1-4 and columns 8-11, and then combining them in a certain way. For example, for each row in the output, the first four elements are from columns 1-4 of the input's row, and the next four elements are from columns 8-11 of the input's row.\n\nBut this would give for row 1: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0, but the output is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are different. For example, columns 1-4 and 9-12. For row 1, columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So combining with columns 1-4 gives 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4, which matches the first row of output.\n\nFor row 2, columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So combining with columns 1-4 gives 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4. But the actual output row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the columns are not consistent across rows.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking certain values from the input, but the pattern is to take the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4, and then for the next four columns, take the values from columns 8-11, but with some modification.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that works for the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. This could be the values from the input's rows 1-4, columns 1-4 and 8-11. But for row 1, columns 8-11 are 0,0,0,0, but the output has 4 4 4 4. So this suggests that maybe the columns are 9-12, but in that case, row 1's columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4.\n\nSo for row 1, the first four elements are columns 1-4, and the next four are columns 9-12.\n\nFor row 2, columns 1-4 are 2,0,0,2. Columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So the output row would be 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4, but the actual output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the columns are different for different rows. For example, for row 2, the columns are 1-4 and 8-11. For row 2, columns 8-11 are 0,4,4,4. So combining gives 2 0 0 2 0 4 4 4. But the actual output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look at example 3.\n\nExample 3's input has a lot of 3s, 4s, 6s, and 2s. The output is 4 rows of 8 elements. For example, the first row of output is 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3. This could be from columns 1-4 and 8-11 of certain rows.\n\nBut without knowing the exact input, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. The output has 4 rows, each with 8 elements. The input has 16 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking every fourth row of the input. For example, rows 1, 2, 3, 4. Then, for each of these rows, take certain columns.\n\nBut how to determine the columns.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. This could be the first four columns (2s) and the next four columns (4s) from row 1. But in row 1, columns 1-4 are 2s, and columns 8-11 are 4s. So if the input has 16 columns, then columns 1-4 and 8-11 are 8 columns. So for each of the rows 1-4, take columns 1-4 and 8-11, and combine them into a row of 8 elements.\n\nBut for row 2, columns 1-4 are 2, 0, 0, 2. Columns 8-11 are 0,4,4,4. So combining gives 2 0 0 2 0 4 4 4. But the output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe the columns are different for different rows. For example, for row 1, columns 1-4 and 8-11. For row 2, columns 1-4 and 9-12. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11, but with some transformation. For example, if the value is zero, replace it with the next value in the sequence.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented in code.\n\nLet me think: the output is 4x8. So for each of the 4 rows in the output, there are 8 columns. The input is a grid of some size. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input. For example, the first two rows of the output are from the input's rows 1-4, and the next two rows are from rows 7-10.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows 1-4 and columns 1-4, and then from rows 1-4 and columns 8-11, but with some transformation.\n\nAnother approach: for each of the 4 rows in the output, the first four elements are from the input's row i, columns 1-4, and the next four elements are from the input's row i, columns 8-11. But this would give for row 1: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0, which doesn't match the output. But in the example, the output is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. So this suggests that the columns are different.\n\nMaybe the columns are 1-4 and 9-12. For row 1, columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So combining gives 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. For row 2, columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So combining with columns 1-4 gives 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4. But the actual output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut perhaps for row 2, the columns 8-11 are 0,4,4,4, and the output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this suggests that the columns are 1-4 and 8-11, but with some modification.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the values from columns 1-4 and 8-11, but replacing some values. For example, if a value is zero, replace it with the next value in the sequence.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll try to write a function that takes the input grid and returns a 4x8 grid, where each row is formed by taking certain columns from the input.\n\nFor example, for the first row of the output, take the first four columns from row 1 and the next four columns from row 1. But this is not working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking every other row and column. For example, for the first row of output, take rows 1, 2, 3, 4 and columns 1-4 and 8-11.\n\nBut I'll have to write code that does this.\n\nLet me try to implement this.\n\nAssume that the input is a grid with 16 rows and 16 columns. The output is 4 rows of 8 columns.\n\nFor each of the 4 output rows, take the first four columns from the input's row i and the next four columns from the input's row i.\n\nBut this is not working for example 1.\n\nAlternatively, for the first output row, take columns 1-4 from row 1 and columns 8-11 from row 1. For the second output row, take columns 1-4 from row 2 and columns 8-11 from row 2.\n\nBut this would give for row 1: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0, which is not the case. So this is incorrect.\n\nBut in example 1, the output for row 1 is 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4. So perhaps the columns are 1-4 and 9-12.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each of the 4 output rows, take the first four columns from the input's row i and the next four columns from the input's row i, but starting from column 9.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(4):\n        row = []\n        # take columns 1-4 from row i+1\n        for j in range(4):\n            row.append(grid[i+1][j])\n        # take columns 9-12 from row i+1\n        for j in range(4):\n            row.append(grid[i+1][8 + j])\n        output.append(row)\n    return output\n\nBut this would give for example 1's first output row: columns 1-4 of row 1 (2,2,2,2) and columns 9-12 of row 1 (4,4,4,4), which matches the first row of output. For row 2, columns 1-4 are 2,0,0,2 and columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So the output row would be 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4, but the actual output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut perhaps the columns are 1-4 and 8-11 for row 2. For row 2, columns 8-11 are 0,4,4,4. So the output row would be 2 0 0 2 0 4 4 4, which doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct, but it works for the first row of example 1.\n\nBut since the examples are not clear, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the second row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. This could be columns 1-4 of row 2 (2,0,0,2) and columns 8-11 of row 2 (0,4,4,4), but the output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. This suggests that the second part is not columns 8-11, but columns 9-12.\n\nBut for row 2, columns 9-12 are 4,4,4,4. So the output row would be 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4. But the actual output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the code that takes rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 9-12, even if it doesn't match all examples.\n\nBut since the test input is provided, perhaps I can look at it.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAssuming this is a 20-row grid with 22 columns. The output should be 4x8. Let's see what the code would produce for this test input.\n\nThe code would take rows 1-4 (assuming the input is 20 rows, so rows 0-19). So rows 1-4 are the second to fifth rows.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nColumns 1-4 are 0,0,3,3. Columns 9-12 are 0,0,0,0. So the first row of output would be 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0. But the actual output is not known, but this is just a guess.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the code that takes rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 9-12, and see if it works for the examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(4):\n        row = []\n        # Take first 4 columns from row i+1 (assuming rows are 0-based)\n        for j in range(4):\n            row.append(grid[i+1][j])\n        # Take columns 9-12 from row i+1\n        for j in range(4):\n            row.append(grid[i+1][8 + j])\n        output.append(row)\n    return output\n\nBut this would produce 4 rows, each with 8 elements. However, this might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut for example 1, this code would work for the first row. For the second row, it would take columns 1-4 of row 2 (2,0,0,2) and columns 9-12 of row 2 (4,4,4,4), giving 2 0 0 2 4 4 4 4. But the actual output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut perhaps the code should take columns 1-4 and 8-11 for row 2. Let's adjust the code to take columns 8-11 instead of 9-12.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nfor j in range(4):\n    row.append(grid[i+1][8 + j])\n\nBut for row 2, columns 8-11 are 0,4,4,4. So the row would be 2 0 0 2 0 4 4 4. But the actual output is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this code, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should take columns 1-4 and 8-11 for the first four rows, and then for the next four rows, take other columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the second row is 2 0 0 2 4 0 0 4. This could be columns 1-4 and 8-11 of row 2, but with some values replaced. For example, the 4 in column 8 is replaced with 0, and the 4 in column 9 is replaced with 0. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that takes rows 1-4 and columns 1-4 and 9-12, even if it's not perfect.\n"
