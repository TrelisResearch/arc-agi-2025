          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The input grid has a 21x21 structure with 0s forming borders and other numbers in the middle.\n2. The output grid appears to be a transformation where certain numbers (like 8, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7) are modified in specific patterns.\n3. There seems to be a pattern where certain numbers are replaced or modified in a way that creates symmetry or specific shapes.\n4. In Example 1, the number 8 is replaced with 4 in certain positions.\n5. In Example 2, the number 6 is replaced with 3 in certain positions.\n6. In Example 3, the number 4 is replaced with 3 in certain positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others in specific patterns, possibly based on their positions and values.\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # Replace 8 with 4 in certain positions\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                \n    # Replace 6 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid[i][j] == 6 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n    # Replace 4 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # Replace 8 with 4 in certain positions\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                \n    # Replace 6 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid[i][j] == 6 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n    # Replace 4 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The input grid has a 21x21 structure with 0s forming borders and other numbers in the middle.\n2. The output grid appears to be a transformation where certain numbers (like 8, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7) are modified in specific patterns.\n3. There seems to be a pattern where certain numbers are replaced or modified in a way that creates symmetry or specific shapes.\n4. In Example 1, the number 8 is replaced with 4 in certain positions.\n5. In Example 2, the number 6 is replaced with 3 in certain positions.\n6. In Example 3, the number 4 is replaced with 3 in certain positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others in specific patterns, possibly based on their positions and values.\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # Replace 8 with 4 in certain positions\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                \n    # Replace 6 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid[i][j] == 6 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n    # Replace 4 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # Replace 8 with 4 in certain positions\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                \n    # Replace 6 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid[i][j] == 6 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n    # Replace 4 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
