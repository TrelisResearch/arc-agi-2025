          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice the following patterns:\n\n1. In Example 1, the output seems to be a rotation of the input grid. The 8s and 2s are moving in a rotational pattern.\n2. In Example 2, the output seems to be a transformation where the 2s and 3s are moving in a specific pattern, possibly related to their positions.\n3. In Example 3, the output seems to be a transformation where the 1s and 2s are moving in a specific pattern, possibly related to their positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves rotating the grid in some way, possibly 90 degrees clockwise, and moving certain values in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise\n    n = len(grid)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[n - j - 1][i]\n    \n    # Move values in a specific pattern\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Find the next non-zero value to the right\n                for k in range(j + 1, n):\n                    if transformed_grid[i][k] != 0:\n                        # Swap the values\n                        transformed_grid[i][j], transformed_grid[i][k] = transformed_grid[i][k], transformed_grid[i][j]\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise\n    n = len(grid)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[n - j - 1][i]\n    \n    # Move values in a specific pattern\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Find the next non-zero value to the right\n                for k in range(j + 1, n):\n                    if transformed_grid[i][k] != 0:\n                        # Swap the values\n                        transformed_grid[i][j], transformed_grid[i][k] = transformed_grid[i][k], transformed_grid[i][j]\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 1, the output seems to be a rotation of the input grid. The 8s and 2s are moving in a rotational pattern.\n2. In Example 2, the output seems to be a transformation where the 2s and 3s are moving in a specific pattern, possibly related to their positions.\n3. In Example 3, the output seems to be a transformation where the 1s and 2s are moving in a specific pattern, possibly related to their positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves rotating the grid in some way, possibly 90 degrees clockwise, and moving certain values in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise\n    n = len(grid)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[n - j - 1][i]\n    \n    # Move values in a specific pattern\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Find the next non-zero value to the right\n                for k in range(j + 1, n):\n                    if transformed_grid[i][k] != 0:\n                        # Swap the values\n                        transformed_grid[i][j], transformed_grid[i][k] = transformed_grid[i][k], transformed_grid[i][j]\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise\n    n = len(grid)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[n - j - 1][i]\n    \n    # Move values in a specific pattern\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Find the next non-zero value to the right\n                for k in range(j + 1, n):\n                    if transformed_grid[i][k] != 0:\n                        # Swap the values\n                        transformed_grid[i][j], transformed_grid[i][k] = transformed_grid[i][k], transformed_grid[i][j]\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
