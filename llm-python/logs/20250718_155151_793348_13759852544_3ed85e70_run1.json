              "content": "I've analyzed the training examples and observed several patterns that seem to be at play in the transformation from input to output grids. Here's what I've observed:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve:\n   - Preserving certain values (like 3s and 0s)\n   - Replacing other values with specific patterns (like 8s, 4s, 2s)\n   - Creating new patterns in specific regions of the grid\n   - Preserving the overall structure of the grid\n\n2. I've noticed that certain values (like 8, 4, 2) seem to be used to create new patterns in specific areas of the grid, often in regions that have certain characteristics (like being surrounded by 3s or 0s).\n\n3. There seems to be a pattern where certain values are replaced with other values based on their position and surrounding values.\n\nBased on these observations, I've implemented a transformation that attempts to replicate these patterns. The transformation involves:\n- Preserving certain values (like 3s and 0s)\n- Replacing other values with specific patterns (like 8s, 4s, 2s)\n- Creating new patterns in specific regions of the grid\n- Preserving the overall structure of the grid\n\nHere's the Python function that implements this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
