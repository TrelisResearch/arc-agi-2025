          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a bunch of 8s and 0s, and some 1s and 3s. The output changes some of the 0s to 8s and 1s to 8s in certain positions. Wait, but the output has 8s in some positions where the input had 0s. Also, there's a 3 in the input that becomes a 3 in the output. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, in the output of Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input's first row was all 8s, so that's the same. But the second row in input was all 0s, and the output has 0s except for the third column which is 8. Wait, maybe there's some kind of pattern where certain positions are replaced based on their neighbors or some other rule.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has 2s, 0s, and 1s. The output has 2s, 1s, and 4s. For example, the third row in input is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the 1s are kept, but some 0s are replaced with 2s. Also, the last row of input is 4s, and the output is 4s. Maybe the 4s are left as is, but others are transformed based on some rule.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s and 0s and 1s. The output has 3s, 0s, and 1s. For instance, the first row is the same. The second row in input is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4. The output is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 4. So the 0s are kept, but some positions are changed. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their neighbors or some other criteria.\n\nHmm. Let me think about possible transformations. One possibility is that certain cells are replaced based on their value and their neighbors. For example, maybe if a cell is 0, it's replaced with 8 if it's adjacent to a certain value. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing 0s with a certain value based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that were 0s but adjacent to 1s. Wait, in the input of Example 1, there's a 1 in the third row, third column. The output in that row has a 1 in the third column, but in the second row, third column, it's 8. Maybe that's not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 8s or other numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that were 0s but in certain rows. Maybe the 8s are replacing 0s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for transformations that might be applied to the grid. For example, maybe the output is a combination of the input and some other pattern. For instance, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are not in the original input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with the maximum value in their row or column. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row 2: 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n\nSo, in this row, the 0s are replaced with 8s in positions 3 and 9 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Well, the input is 13 columns. Let's check. The input row is 13 elements. The output row has 8s in positions 2 and 8 (if 0-based). Wait, the input row is 0s, and the output has 8s in positions 2 and 8. Maybe that's related to the original grid's structure. For example, maybe the 8s are placed in certain positions based on the original grid's 1s or 3s.\n\nLooking at the input of Example 1, there are 1s in positions (row 2, column 2) and (row 4, column 4), (row 5, column 9), (row 6, column 6), (row 8, column 2), (row 9, column 3), (row 10, column 9), (row 11, column 3). Wait, maybe these positions are connected in some way. For example, the 8s in the output are placed in positions that are adjacent to these 1s or 3s. Or perhaps the 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically located.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row or column as certain numbers. For example, in Example 1's output row 2, the 8s are in columns 2 and 8. Maybe those positions are connected to the 1s in the input. For example, the input has a 1 in row 2, column 2. Then, maybe the output has 8s in positions that are symmetrically opposite. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the input that is in a certain position. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 8s in positions 2 and 8. Maybe those positions correspond to the positions of the 1s in the input. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output. The input has 2s, 0s, and 1s. The output has 2s, 1s, and 4s. For example, in the third row of input: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the 0s are replaced with 2s in positions 2 and 4. But why? Maybe because those positions are adjacent to 1s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with the value of the cell that's in the same row or column. For example, in row 2 of input, the output has 8s in positions 2 and 8. Maybe those are positions that are in the same row as a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a combination of the input and some other pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is all 8s, which is the same as the input's first row. The last row of input is all 3s, and the output is all 3s. So perhaps the first and last rows are left as is. But the other rows are modified.\n\nIn Example 2, the first row is all 2s, and the output is the same. The last row is all 4s, and the output is the same. So maybe the first and last rows are not modified. But the other rows have changes.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is to leave the first and last rows as they are, and modify the other rows based on some pattern. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has 3s and 0s and 1s. The output has 3s, 0s, and 1s. For example, in the second row of input, the output is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 4. The input was 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4. So the 0s in position 7 (original input) is 0, but in the output, it's 4. Wait, but the original input's row 2 is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4. The output is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 4. So the 0 in position 7 (original) is replaced with 4, and position 8 is 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in a different row. For example, if the cell is 0, check the cell in the same column but in another row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are symmetric. For example, in row 2, columns 2 and 8. Maybe those are positions that are mirrored. But I need to check more examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if they are in certain positions relative to 1s or other numbers. For example, in the input of Example 1, there's a 1 in row 2, column 2. The output in row 2, column 2 is 0 (original input is 0, but output is 0?), no. Wait, in Example 1's input, the second row is all 0s. The output's second row is 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0. So the third column (index 2) is 8, and the ninth column (index 8) is 8. So maybe those positions are in the same row as the 1s. For example, in the third row of the input, there's a 1 in column 2. Maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are symmetric to the 1s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a combination of the input and some other pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row is 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. The input's third row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1 is in column 4 (original input), and the output has 8 in column 4 (original input's fifth column?), maybe not. Wait, the original input's third row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the 1 is now in column 2 (original input's column 2 was 0, but output is 1?), no. Wait, the input's third row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the original 0s in column 2 (third row) is now 1. So maybe that's a change. But how?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their value and their neighbors. For example, if a cell is 0, and there's a 1 in a certain position, replace it with 8. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell that is in the same column but in a different row. For example, in Example 1's second row, which is all 0s, the output has 8s in positions that are in columns that have 1s in other rows. For example, in the third row, column 2 is 0, but in the output, that position is 1. Wait, no. The input's third row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the third row's column 2 (original input 0) is now 1. So maybe that's a pattern where 0s are replaced with 1s if there's a 1 in the same column in another row. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the transformation as a combination of two steps: first, replace 0s with 8s in certain positions, and then replace some other values. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's structure. For example, the output has 8s in positions that are part of certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row as the original 1s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the transformation in Example 3. The input has a 3 in the first row, and the output is the same. The input's second row is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4. The output is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 4. So the 0 in column 7 (original input) is replaced with 4. But why? Maybe because there's a 1 in column 6 (original input's column 6 is 0, but in the output, column 7 is 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell that is in the same row but in a certain position. For example, in the third row of Example 3, the input is 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. The output is 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. So the 1 in column 2 is replaced with 0. But why?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the output grids. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are not in the original input's 8s. But the first and last rows are left as is. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on some pattern, and leave other values as is.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row as certain 1s. For example, the third row of the input has a 1 in column 4. The output's third row has an 8 in column 4 (original input's fifth column? Wait, the input's third row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the 1 in column 4 (original input's fifth column?) is replaced with 8. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row as the 1s and 3s. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output of Example 1. The output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The input's second row is all 0s. So perhaps those positions are determined by the original grid's other rows. For example, in the third row, there is a 1 in column 2. Maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are mirrored or symmetric to those 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same column as the 1s. For example, in the third row, column 2 has a 1. So in the second row, column 2, which is 0, is replaced with 8. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a combination of the input and some other pattern. For example, the output might be the input with certain values replaced based on their position. For example, in the first row, all 8s are left as is. In the second row, the 0s are replaced with 8s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can be applied to all examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row as 1s. In Example 2, the output has 2s in positions that are adjacent to 1s. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell that is in the same column but in a different row. For example, if a cell is 0, check the cell in the same column but in another row. If that cell is non-zero, replace the 0 with that value. But how to determine which row to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell that is in the same row but in a certain position. For example, in Example 1's second row, which is all 0s, the output has 8s in columns 2 and 8. Maybe those columns are where there are 1s in other rows. For example, in row 2, column 2 is 0, but in row 3, column 2 is 0. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing 0s with 8s if the cell is in a certain position relative to other cells. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are placed in positions that are not in the first or last row, and are in certain columns. But this is not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the transformation in terms of the output's values. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are not in the first or last row. The first and last rows are left as is. The other rows have 8s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions that are in the same row as a 1 or 3. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 1, so the second row's columns 2 and 8 are replaced with 8s. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions that are in the same column as a 1 or 3. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to think of a possible transformation that can explain some of the examples. For example, maybe the transformation replaces 0s with 8s if there's a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. But how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if the cell is in a certain pattern, like the middle of the grid. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in the middle columns. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the input with some 0s replaced by 8s. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are not in the first or last row, and in certain columns. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions that are in the same row as a 1 or 3. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if the cell is in the same row as a 1 or 3. For example, in Example 1, the second row is all 0s, but there are 1s in other rows. So the 0s in the second row are replaced with 8s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions that are in the same row as a 1 or 3 and in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. These columns are where there are 1s in other rows.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the original grid's 1s and 3s. For example, for each 0 in the grid, if there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column, replace it with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if the cell is in the same row as a 1 or 3, and in the same column as a 1 or 3. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not sure, maybe I should look for a pattern that can be implemented. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row as a 1 or 3. So for each cell in the grid, if it's a 0 and there's a 1 or 3 in the same row or column, replace it with 8. But how to implement this.\n\nLet me try to code this idea. For each cell (i,j) in the grid, if grid[i][j] is 0, then check if there's a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. If yes, replace with 8. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nBut let's test this idea against the examples.\n\nExample 1: Input row 2 is all 0s. Let's check for each 0 in this row. For example, in column 2 (index 2), check if there's a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. Since the row is all 0s, but the column 2 (index 2) has in other rows: in row 2, column 2 is 0. In row 3, column 2 is 0. In row 4, column 2 is 0. In row 5, column 2 is 0. In row 6, column 2 is 0. In row 7, column 2 is 0. In row 8, column 2 is 1. So in column 2, there is a 1 in row 8. So according to this rule, the 0 in row 2, column 2 would be replaced with 8. Similarly for column 8. So this would explain the 8s in row 2.\n\nIn Example 1's output, row 2 has 8s in columns 2 and 8. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 2s, 0s, and 1s. The output has 2s, 1s, and 4s. For example, the third row of input is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the 0s in positions 0 and 3 (assuming 0-based) are replaced with 2s. According to the rule, if there's a 1 or 3 in the same row or column, replace with 8. But in this case, the 0s are in the same row as 1s. So according to the rule, they would be replaced with 8. But in the output, they are replaced with 2. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nHmm, this indicates that my hypothesis is incorrect. So I need to think of a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the middle of the grid. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a combination of the input and some other pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row as a 1 or 3 and in certain columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing 0s with the value of the cell that is in the same row but in a certain position. For example, in Example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 8s in columns 2 and 8. These columns might be the positions where there are 1s or 3s in other rows. For example, in row 8, column 2 is 1. So column 2 is replaced with 8 in row 2. Similarly, in row 9, column 3 is 1. So column 3 in row 2 is replaced with 8? No, in the output row 2, column 2 is 8, but column 3 is 0.\n\nThis is not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Look for the transformation that applies to all examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are not in the first or last row. In Example 2, the output has 2s in the first row and 4s in the last row. So maybe the first and last rows are unchanged, and the other rows are transformed based on some pattern.\n\nIn Example 3, the first and last rows are unchanged. So perhaps the first and last rows are left as is, and the other rows are transformed.\n\nNow, for the other rows, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 8s in certain columns. Maybe these columns are where there are 1s or 3s in other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. But in Example 2, the output has 2s in some positions, not 8s. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the maximum value in their row or column. For example, in Example 1's second row, the maximum value is 0 (since it's all 0s), but the output has 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions that are in the same row as a 1 or 3 and in the same column as a 1 or 3. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to look for another approach. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions that are in the same row as a 1 or 3 and in the same column as a 1 or 3. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. In column 2, there is a 1 in row 8. In column 8, there is a 1 in row 9. So this could be the case.\n\nBut how to implement this. For each cell (i,j) in the grid, if it's a 0, check if there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. If yes, replace with 8. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nBut in Example 2, this would replace 0s with 8s where there are 1s in the row or column. But in Example 2's output, the 0s are replaced with 2s or 4s. So this suggests that this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if there is a 1 in the same row or column, and replace 0s with 2s if there is a 1 in the same row or column. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if there is a 1 in the same row or column, and replace 0s with 2s if there is a 2 in the same row or column. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to think of the transformation as replacing 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row as 1s or 3s and in the same column as 1s or 3s. But how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if the cell is in the same row as a 1 or 3 and in the same column as a 1 or 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I have. Let's try to code a function that replaces 0s with 8s if there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. Let's see if this works for the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, this would replace 0s in row 2 with 8s where there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. In row 2, the 0s are replaced with 8s in columns 2 and 8, which are where there are 1s in other rows. This seems to fit.\n\nFor Example 2, this would replace 0s with 8s where there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. But in the output of Example 2, the 0s are replaced with 2s or 4s. So this suggests that this is not the correct pattern.\n\nBut perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if there is a 1 in the same row or column, and replace 0s with 2s if there is a 2 in the same row or column. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if there is a 1 in the same row or column, and replace 0s with 2s if there is a 2 in the same row or column. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column, and leave other values as is. Even if this doesn't fit all examples, it's a possible approach.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if it's 0, check if there is any 1 or 3 in the same row or column. If yes, replace with 8. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me write the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Iterate over each cell\n    for i in range(12):  # since the input is 12 rows\n        for j in range(13):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column\n                has_1_or_3 = False\n                # Check row i\n                for k in range(13):\n                    if transformed[i][k] in (1, 3):\n                        has_1_or_3 = True\n                        break\n                # Check column j\n                for k in range(12):\n                    if transformed[k][j] in (1, 3):\n                        has_1_or_3 = True\n                        break\n                if has_1_or_3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, this would replace 0s with 8s where there are 1s in the same row or column. But the output of Example 2 has 2s and 4s in some positions. So this code would not match Example 2.\n\nBut perhaps this is the best I can do given the examples. Let's test this code against the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the code would replace 0s in row 2 with 8s where there are 1s or 3s in the same row or column. In row 2, the 0s are in all columns. But in column 2, there is a 1 in row 8. So the code would replace those 0s with 8s. So this fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 1s in certain positions. For example, the third row has 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. So in this row, the 0s would be replaced with 8s because there are 1s in the same row. But the output of Example 2 has 2s in those positions. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This indicates that my hypothesis is wrong. So I need to think of another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 2, the output has 2s in the first row and 4s in the last row. So maybe the first and last rows are unchanged, and the other rows are transformed based on some pattern.\n\nIn Example 2, the third row of input is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the 0s are replaced with 2s. Maybe the 2s are the value of the cell in the same row but in a certain position. For example, the 0s are replaced with the value of the cell in the same row but in a certain column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in a certain row. For example, in Example 2's third row, the 0s are replaced with 2s because there are 2s in the same column in other rows.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but in a certain position. For example, in Example 2's third row, the 0s are replaced with 2s because there are 2s in the same row.\n\nBut in the input's third row, there are no 2s. So this is not possible.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if they are in certain positions, and replace other values with other values based on some other rule.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation replaces 0s with 8s if there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column, and leaves other values as is. Even if this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be as above. Let's write it.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a bunch of 8s and 0s, and some 1s and 3s. The output changes some of the 0s to 8s and 1s to 8s in certain positions. Wait, but the output has 8s in some positions where the input had 0s. Also, there's a 3 in the input that becomes a 3 in the output. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, in the output of Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input's first row was all 8s, so that's the same. But the second row in input was all 0s, and the output has 0s except for the third column which is 8. Wait, maybe there's some kind of pattern where certain positions are replaced based on their neighbors or some other rule.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has 2s, 0s, and 1s. The output has 2s, 1s, and 4s. For example, the third row in input is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the 1s are kept, but some 0s are replaced with 2s. Also, the last row of input is 4s, and the output is 4s. Maybe the 4s are left as is, but others are transformed based on some rule.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s and 0s and 1s. The output has 3s, 0s, and 1s. For instance, the first row is the same. The second row in input is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4. The output is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 4. So the 0s are kept, but some positions are changed. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their neighbors or some other criteria.\n\nHmm. Let me think about possible transformations. One possibility is that certain cells are replaced based on their value and their neighbors. For example, maybe if a cell is 0, it's replaced with 8 if it's adjacent to a certain value. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing 0s with a certain value based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that were 0s but adjacent to 1s. Wait, in the input of Example 1, there's a 1 in the third row, third column. The output in that row has a 1 in the third column, but in the second row, third column, it's 8. Maybe that's not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 8s or other numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that were 0s but in certain rows. Maybe the 8s are replacing 0s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for transformations that might be applied to the grid. For example, maybe the output is a combination of the input and some other pattern. For instance, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are not in the original input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with the maximum value in their row or column. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput row 2: 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n\nSo, in this row, the 0s are replaced with 8s in positions 3 and 9 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Well, the input is 13 columns. Let's check. The input row is 13 elements. The output row has 8s in positions 2 and 8 (if 0-based). Wait, the input row is 0s, and the output has 8s in positions 2 and 8. Maybe that's related to the original grid's structure. For example, maybe the 8s are placed in certain positions based on the original grid's 1s or 3s.\n\nLooking at the input of Example 1, there are 1s in positions (row 2, column 2) and (row 4, column 4), (row 5, column 9), (row 6, column 6), (row 8, column 2), (row 9, column 3), (row 10, column 9), (row 11, column 3). Wait, maybe these positions are connected in some way. For example, the 8s in the output are placed in positions that are adjacent to these 1s or 3s. Or perhaps the 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically located.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row or column as certain numbers. For example, in Example 1's output row 2, the 8s are in columns 2 and 8. Maybe those positions are connected to the 1s in the input. For example, the input has a 1 in row 2, column 2. Then, maybe the output has 8s in positions that are symmetrically opposite. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the input that is in a certain position. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 8s in positions 2 and 8. Maybe those positions correspond to the positions of the 1s in the input. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output. The input has 2s, 0s, and 1s. The output has 2s, 1s, and 4s. For example, in the third row of input: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the 0s are replaced with 2s in positions 2 and 4. But why? Maybe because those positions are adjacent to 1s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with the value of the cell that's in the same row or column. For example, in row 2 of input, the output has 8s in positions 2 and 8. Maybe those are positions that are in the same row as a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a combination of the input and some other pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is all 8s, which is the same as the input's first row. The last row of input is all 3s, and the output is all 3s. So perhaps the first and last rows are left as is. But the other rows are modified.\n\nIn Example 2, the first row is all 2s, and the output is the same. The last row is all 4s, and the output is the same. So maybe the first and last rows are not modified. But the other rows have changes.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is to leave the first and last rows as they are, and modify the other rows based on some pattern. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has 3s and 0s and 1s. The output has 3s, 0s, and 1s. For example, in the second row of input, the output is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 4. The input was 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4. So the 0s in position 7 (original input) is 0, but in the output, it's 4. Wait, but the original input's row 2 is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4. The output is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 4. So the 0 in position 7 (original) is replaced with 4, and position 8 is 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in a different row. For example, if the cell is 0, check the cell in the same column but in another row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are symmetric. For example, in row 2, columns 2 and 8. Maybe those are positions that are mirrored. But I need to check more examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if they are in certain positions relative to 1s or other numbers. For example, in the input of Example 1, there's a 1 in row 2, column 2. The output in row 2, column 2 is 0 (original input is 0, but output is 0?), no. Wait, in Example 1's input, the second row is all 0s. The output's second row is 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0. So the third column (index 2) is 8, and the ninth column (index 8) is 8. So maybe those positions are in the same row as the 1s. For example, in the third row of the input, there's a 1 in column 2. Maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are symmetric to the 1s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a combination of the input and some other pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row is 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. The input's third row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1 is in column 4 (original input), and the output has 8 in column 4 (original input's fifth column?), maybe not. Wait, the original input's third row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the 1 is now in column 2 (original input's column 2 was 0, but output is 1?), no. Wait, the input's third row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the original 0s in column 2 (third row) is now 1. So maybe that's a change. But how?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their value and their neighbors. For example, if a cell is 0, and there's a 1 in a certain position, replace it with 8. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell that is in the same column but in a different row. For example, in Example 1's second row, which is all 0s, the output has 8s in positions that are in columns that have 1s in other rows. For example, in the third row, column 2 is 0, but in the output, that position is 1. Wait, no. The input's third row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the third row's column 2 (original input 0) is now 1. So maybe that's a pattern where 0s are replaced with 1s if there's a 1 in the same column in another row. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the transformation as a combination of two steps: first, replace 0s with 8s in certain positions, and then replace some other values. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's structure. For example, the output has 8s in positions that are part of certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row as the original 1s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the transformation in Example 3. The input has a 3 in the first row, and the output is the same. The input's second row is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4. The output is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 4. So the 0 in column 7 (original input) is replaced with 4. But why? Maybe because there's a 1 in column 6 (original input's column 6 is 0, but in the output, column 7 is 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell that is in the same row but in a certain position. For example, in the third row of Example 3, the input is 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. The output is 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. So the 1 in column 2 is replaced with 0. But why?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the output grids. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are not in the original input's 8s. But the first and last rows are left as is. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on some pattern, and leave other values as is.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row as certain 1s. For example, the third row of the input has a 1 in column 4. The output's third row has an 8 in column 4 (original input's fifth column? Wait, the input's third row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the 1 in column 4 (original input's fifth column?) is replaced with 8. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row as the 1s and 3s. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output of Example 1. The output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The input's second row is all 0s. So perhaps those positions are determined by the original grid's other rows. For example, in the third row, there is a 1 in column 2. Maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are mirrored or symmetric to those 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same column as the 1s. For example, in the third row, column 2 has a 1. So in the second row, column 2, which is 0, is replaced with 8. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a combination of the input and some other pattern. For example, the output might be the input with certain values replaced based on their position. For example, in the first row, all 8s are left as is. In the second row, the 0s are replaced with 8s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can be applied to all examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row as 1s. In Example 2, the output has 2s in positions that are adjacent to 1s. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell that is in the same column but in a different row. For example, if a cell is 0, check the cell in the same column but in another row. If that cell is non-zero, replace the 0 with that value. But how to determine which row to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell that is in the same row but in a certain position. For example, in Example 1's second row, which is all 0s, the output has 8s in columns 2 and 8. Maybe those columns are where there are 1s in other rows. For example, in row 2, column 2 is 0, but in row 3, column 2 is 0. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing 0s with 8s if the cell is in a certain position relative to other cells. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are placed in positions that are not in the first or last row, and are in certain columns. But this is not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the transformation in terms of the output's values. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are not in the first or last row. The first and last rows are left as is. The other rows have 8s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions that are in the same row as a 1 or 3. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 1, so the second row's columns 2 and 8 are replaced with 8s. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions that are in the same column as a 1 or 3. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to think of a possible transformation that can explain some of the examples. For example, maybe the transformation replaces 0s with 8s if there's a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. But how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if the cell is in a certain pattern, like the middle of the grid. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in the middle columns. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the input with some 0s replaced by 8s. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are not in the first or last row, and in certain columns. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions that are in the same row as a 1 or 3. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if the cell is in the same row as a 1 or 3. For example, in Example 1, the second row is all 0s, but there are 1s in other rows. So the 0s in the second row are replaced with 8s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions that are in the same row as a 1 or 3 and in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. These columns are where there are 1s in other rows.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the original grid's 1s and 3s. For example, for each 0 in the grid, if there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column, replace it with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if the cell is in the same row as a 1 or 3, and in the same column as a 1 or 3. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not sure, maybe I should look for a pattern that can be implemented. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row as a 1 or 3. So for each cell in the grid, if it's a 0 and there's a 1 or 3 in the same row or column, replace it with 8. But how to implement this.\n\nLet me try to code this idea. For each cell (i,j) in the grid, if grid[i][j] is 0, then check if there's a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. If yes, replace with 8. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nBut let's test this idea against the examples.\n\nExample 1: Input row 2 is all 0s. Let's check for each 0 in this row. For example, in column 2 (index 2), check if there's a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. Since the row is all 0s, but the column 2 (index 2) has in other rows: in row 2, column 2 is 0. In row 3, column 2 is 0. In row 4, column 2 is 0. In row 5, column 2 is 0. In row 6, column 2 is 0. In row 7, column 2 is 0. In row 8, column 2 is 1. So in column 2, there is a 1 in row 8. So according to this rule, the 0 in row 2, column 2 would be replaced with 8. Similarly for column 8. So this would explain the 8s in row 2.\n\nIn Example 1's output, row 2 has 8s in columns 2 and 8. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 2s, 0s, and 1s. The output has 2s, 1s, and 4s. For example, the third row of input is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the 0s in positions 0 and 3 (assuming 0-based) are replaced with 2s. According to the rule, if there's a 1 or 3 in the same row or column, replace with 8. But in this case, the 0s are in the same row as 1s. So according to the rule, they would be replaced with 8. But in the output, they are replaced with 2. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nHmm, this indicates that my hypothesis is incorrect. So I need to think of a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if they are in certain positions, like the middle of the grid. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a combination of the input and some other pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row as a 1 or 3 and in certain columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing 0s with the value of the cell that is in the same row but in a certain position. For example, in Example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 8s in columns 2 and 8. These columns might be the positions where there are 1s or 3s in other rows. For example, in row 8, column 2 is 1. So column 2 is replaced with 8 in row 2. Similarly, in row 9, column 3 is 1. So column 3 in row 2 is replaced with 8? No, in the output row 2, column 2 is 8, but column 3 is 0.\n\nThis is not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Look for the transformation that applies to all examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are not in the first or last row. In Example 2, the output has 2s in the first row and 4s in the last row. So maybe the first and last rows are unchanged, and the other rows are transformed based on some pattern.\n\nIn Example 3, the first and last rows are unchanged. So perhaps the first and last rows are left as is, and the other rows are transformed.\n\nNow, for the other rows, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 8s in certain columns. Maybe these columns are where there are 1s or 3s in other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. But in Example 2, the output has 2s in some positions, not 8s. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the maximum value in their row or column. For example, in Example 1's second row, the maximum value is 0 (since it's all 0s), but the output has 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions that are in the same row as a 1 or 3 and in the same column as a 1 or 3. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to look for another approach. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions that are in the same row as a 1 or 3 and in the same column as a 1 or 3. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. In column 2, there is a 1 in row 8. In column 8, there is a 1 in row 9. So this could be the case.\n\nBut how to implement this. For each cell (i,j) in the grid, if it's a 0, check if there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. If yes, replace with 8. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nBut in Example 2, this would replace 0s with 8s where there are 1s in the row or column. But in Example 2's output, the 0s are replaced with 2s or 4s. So this suggests that this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if there is a 1 in the same row or column, and replace 0s with 2s if there is a 1 in the same row or column. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if there is a 1 in the same row or column, and replace 0s with 2s if there is a 2 in the same row or column. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to think of the transformation as replacing 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row as 1s or 3s and in the same column as 1s or 3s. But how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if the cell is in the same row as a 1 or 3 and in the same column as a 1 or 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I have. Let's try to code a function that replaces 0s with 8s if there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. Let's see if this works for the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, this would replace 0s in row 2 with 8s where there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. In row 2, the 0s are replaced with 8s in columns 2 and 8, which are where there are 1s in other rows. This seems to fit.\n\nFor Example 2, this would replace 0s with 8s where there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column. But in the output of Example 2, the 0s are replaced with 2s or 4s. So this suggests that this is not the correct pattern.\n\nBut perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if there is a 1 in the same row or column, and replace 0s with 2s if there is a 2 in the same row or column. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if there is a 1 in the same row or column, and replace 0s with 2s if there is a 2 in the same row or column. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column, and leave other values as is. Even if this doesn't fit all examples, it's a possible approach.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if it's 0, check if there is any 1 or 3 in the same row or column. If yes, replace with 8. Otherwise, leave as 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me write the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Iterate over each cell\n    for i in range(12):  # since the input is 12 rows\n        for j in range(13):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column\n                has_1_or_3 = False\n                # Check row i\n                for k in range(13):\n                    if transformed[i][k] in (1, 3):\n                        has_1_or_3 = True\n                        break\n                # Check column j\n                for k in range(12):\n                    if transformed[k][j] in (1, 3):\n                        has_1_or_3 = True\n                        break\n                if has_1_or_3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, this would replace 0s with 8s where there are 1s in the same row or column. But the output of Example 2 has 2s and 4s in some positions. So this code would not match Example 2.\n\nBut perhaps this is the best I can do given the examples. Let's test this code against the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the code would replace 0s in row 2 with 8s where there are 1s or 3s in the same row or column. In row 2, the 0s are in all columns. But in column 2, there is a 1 in row 8. So the code would replace those 0s with 8s. So this fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 1s in certain positions. For example, the third row has 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. So in this row, the 0s would be replaced with 8s because there are 1s in the same row. But the output of Example 2 has 2s in those positions. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This indicates that my hypothesis is wrong. So I need to think of another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 2, the output has 2s in the first row and 4s in the last row. So maybe the first and last rows are unchanged, and the other rows are transformed based on some pattern.\n\nIn Example 2, the third row of input is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the 0s are replaced with 2s. Maybe the 2s are the value of the cell in the same row but in a certain position. For example, the 0s are replaced with the value of the cell in the same row but in a certain column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in a certain row. For example, in Example 2's third row, the 0s are replaced with 2s because there are 2s in the same column in other rows.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but in a certain position. For example, in Example 2's third row, the 0s are replaced with 2s because there are 2s in the same row.\n\nBut in the input's third row, there are no 2s. So this is not possible.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s if they are in certain positions, and replace other values with other values based on some other rule.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation replaces 0s with 8s if there is a 1 or 3 in the same row or column, and leaves other values as is. Even if this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be as above. Let's write it.\n"
