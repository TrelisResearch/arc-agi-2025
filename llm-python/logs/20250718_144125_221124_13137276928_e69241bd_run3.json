          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 9x9 grid. The output also is 9x9. Let me compare some cells. For instance, the first row of input is 5 0 6 0 5 0 0 5 0. The output first row is 5 6 6 6 5 0 0 5 8. So, the first cell remains 5. The second cell was 0 in input, but in output it's 6. The third cell was 6, stays 6. Fourth cell was 0, becomes 6. Fifth cell was 5, stays 5. Sixth was 0, becomes 0. Seventh was 0, stays 0. Eighth was 5, stays 5. Ninth was 0, becomes 8. Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe some kind of propagation or filling in based on neighbors?\n\nLooking at the second row of input: 0 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0. Output is 0 5 6 5 5 5 0 5 8. So the third cell was 0, becomes 6. The ninth cell was 0, becomes 8. Maybe the 6 and 8 are appearing in certain positions. Let me check other rows.\n\nIn Example 1's third row input: 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 0. Output is 5 6 6 6 6 5 5 8 8. So the second cell was 0, becomes 6. Third cell 0 becomes 6. Fourth 0 becomes 6. Fifth 0 becomes 6. Sixth 5 stays. Seventh 5 stays. Eighth 8 stays. Ninth 0 becomes 8. So maybe in some regions, certain numbers are being filled in based on surrounding cells?\n\nLooking at Example 2. Input first row is 5 1 0 5 0 5 0 0 5. Output first row is 5 1 1 5 3 5 0 0 5. So the third cell was 0, becomes 1. The fifth cell was 0, becomes 3. The second cell remains 1. The fourth cell remains 5. The sixth remains 5. The seventh and eighth are 0. The ninth is 5. So maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are filled with numbers based on adjacent cells. Like, maybe if a cell is 0, it's replaced with a number that's derived from nearby cells. For example, in the third cell of the first row, maybe it's looking at the cell to the left (which is 1) and the cell above (which is 5 in the first row of input?), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain cells are filled based on their position. For instance, maybe cells in certain positions (like the middle) are being filled with specific numbers. Or perhaps there's a rule where if a cell is 0, it's replaced with a number based on the sum of surrounding cells or something similar.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the outputs. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The second row starts with 0, 5, 6, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 8. The third row starts with 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 8, 8. So maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being filled with 6s or 8s based on their position. For example, in the first row, the third, fourth, and fifth cells are 6, 6, 6. Then in the third row, the second, third, fourth, fifth cells are 6, 6, 6, 6. Maybe there's a horizontal or vertical pattern where certain cells are filled with 6s or 8s.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the first row has 5, 1, 1, 5, 3, 5, 0, 0, 5. The second row is 5, 1, 1, 5, 3, 3, 5, 0, 5. Third row is 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 3, 5, 0, 0. So in the first two rows, the third cell is 1, then 1, then 5, etc. Maybe the 1s and 3s are appearing in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is based on some kind of propagation where 0s are replaced with numbers that are derived from adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with numbers that are determined by the closest non-zero cells. For example, in the first example's first row, the third cell was 6, which is the same as the input's third cell. But in the second row, the third cell was 0, and in the output it's 6. Maybe the 6s are filling in certain positions where there's a 5 or 6 nearby.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are filled with numbers that are the same as the numbers in the original grid but in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 5 6 6 6 6 5 5 8 8. The original input's third row was 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 0. So the 6s are filling in the second, third, fourth, fifth positions. Maybe those positions are being filled with 6s based on some rule.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's output, the ninth column has 8 in several positions. For example, the first row's ninth cell is 8, the second row's ninth is 8, third row's ninth is 8, etc. So maybe the ninth column is being filled with 8s in certain positions. But in the input, the ninth column had 0s in many places. So perhaps the 8s are being filled in certain positions based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing 0s with numbers based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the middle of a certain region, it's filled with 6 or 8. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The test input is a 9x9 grid. The output is not given, but the task is to find the transformation. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with numbers based on some pattern, like the sum of the surrounding cells or something else.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for patterns in the outputs. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The original input's first row was 5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0. So the 0s in positions 2, 4, 6, 9 are being replaced with 6, 6, 0, 8. Wait, position 6 was 0 in input and remains 0 in output. So that's not a pattern. But position 2 was 0 and becomes 6. Position 4 was 0 and becomes 6. Position 9 was 0 and becomes 8. So maybe for some positions, the 0s are replaced with 6 or 8 based on their location.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with numbers that are the same as the numbers in the original grid's surrounding cells. For example, in the first row, the third cell was 6 in input, and in the output it's 6. The fourth cell was 0 in input, and in output it's 6. Maybe that's because the third cell is 6, so the fourth cell is filled with 6. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left or above. For example, in the first row, the second cell was 0. The cell to the left (position 1) is 5, but the output is 6. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the sum of surrounding cells. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are filled with numbers based on their row and column. For example, in the first example, the third row of output has 5 6 6 6 6 5 5 8 8. The original input's third row was 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 0. So the second to fifth cells are filled with 6s. Maybe those positions are being filled with 6s because they are in a certain range of rows and columns. For example, if the row is 3 (third row), then the second to fifth columns are filled with 6s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the same value as the cell to the right or left. For example, in the first row of example 1, the second cell is 0. The cell to the right is 6, so it becomes 6. The fourth cell is 0, the cell to the right is 5 (original input's fourth cell is 0, fifth is 5). But in the output, the fourth cell is 6. That doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of non-zero cells in the row or column. For example, if a cell is 0, replace it with the count of non-zero cells in that row or column. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The first row input was 5 1 0 5 0 5 0 0 5. The output is 5 1 1 5 3 5 0 0 5. So the third cell was 0, becomes 1. The fifth cell was 0, becomes 3. The seventh and eighth are 0, but in output they are 0 and 0. So maybe the third cell is filled with 1, which is the same as the cell to the left (which is 1). The fifth cell is filled with 3, which could be the sum of some adjacent cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in the first row of example 2, the third cell is 0. The cell in the same column (third column) in the row above (second row) is 0. But that doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of propagation. For example, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in its row or column. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the 6s and 8s are being filled in certain regions. For example, in example 1, the third row's second to fifth columns are 6s. Maybe that's because those positions are in a certain area of the grid. Like, if the row is in the middle, then certain columns are filled with 6s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the 6s and 8s are being filled in such a way that they form certain patterns. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The second row has 0, 5, 6, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 8. The third row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 8, 8. So the 6s are forming a kind of horizontal line in the middle of the grid. Maybe that's a clue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell above it (row 0, column 1) is 0. But that doesn't help. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. For example, in example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell to the right is 6 (original input's third cell). So the second cell becomes 6. Then the fourth cell is 0, the cell to the right is 5 (original input's fifth cell). But in the output, the fourth cell is 6. That doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but to the left. For example, in example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5. But the output is 6. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting a bit frustrating. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the outputs of the examples.\n\nIn example 1, the output's first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The original input's first row is 5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0. So the 0s in positions 2, 4, 6, 9 are replaced with 6, 6, 0, 8. Wait, position 6 is 0 and remains 0. So maybe not. But position 2 and 4 are replaced with 6. Position 9 is replaced with 8. So maybe the 6s are in positions where there are certain conditions.\n\nLooking at example 2's output, the first row has 5, 1, 1, 5, 3, 5, 0, 0, 5. The input's first row is 5, 1, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5. So the third cell (0) becomes 1, fifth (0) becomes 3. The seventh and eighth are 0 and remain 0. So maybe the third cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left (which is 1), and the fifth cell is replaced with 3, which could be the sum of some cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell above it (row 0, column 1) is 0. Not helpful. But in example 2's first row, third cell is 0. The cell above it (row 0, column 2) is 0. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 5s in the row or column. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the 6 and 8 are being filled in certain positions based on their row and column indices. For example, in example 1, the third row's second to fifth columns are 6s. The third row is row index 2 (assuming 0-based). Maybe if the row is in the middle, then certain columns are filled with 6s. Similarly, the ninth column in the output has 8s in some positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but in the next column. For example, if a cell is 0, replace it with the next cell's value. But that might not work for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row below. For example, in example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell below it (row 1, column 1) is 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of rules. For example, if a cell is 0, replace it with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise the value of the cell above. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the nearest non-zero cell in the same row or column. For example, in example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The nearest non-zero to the left is 5 (cell 0), so it becomes 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the outputs of the examples. For example, in example 1's output, the third row has 5 6 6 6 6 5 5 8 8. The original input's third row was 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 0. So the second to fifth cells are filled with 6s. Maybe those positions are in the middle of the row. Similarly, in the first row, positions 2, 3, 4 are filled with 6s. Maybe the 6s are filling in the middle of the row. So for rows 0-2, maybe the middle three columns are filled with 6s.\n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe for certain rows, the middle columns are filled with 6s. For example, in example 1, rows 0, 1, 2 have some 6s in the middle. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s if they are in certain positions, and 8s in others. For example, in example 1, the ninth column has 8s in certain rows. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, replace with 6, else 8. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but in the column that is the same as the row index. For example, in example 1, the third row (row index 2) has 6s in columns 1-4. But that's not clear.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of rules, such as:\n\n- For each cell that is 0, replace it with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise the value of the cell above.\n\nBut I need to test this with the examples.\n\nIn example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5 (original input's first cell). So according to this rule, it would become 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value of the cell to the right. For example, in the first row's second cell (0), the cell to the right is 6 (original input's third cell). So replace with 6. Which matches the output. Then for the fourth cell (0), the cell to the right is 5 (original input's fifth cell). But the output is 6. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nBut in the first row of example 1, the fourth cell is 0. The cell to the right is 5 (original input's fifth cell), but in the output it's 6. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell to the left is non-zero, and the cell to the right is non-zero, then take the average. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the 6s and 8s are being filled in such a way that they form certain patterns. For example, in example 1's output, the 6s are filling in a horizontal line in the middle of the grid. Maybe that's a clue that the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s in certain regions.\n\nBut how to determine which regions. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s if they are in the middle of the grid. For example, if the row and column are in the middle range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s in certain positions based on the original grid's values. For example, if there's a 5 in the original grid, then the neighboring cells are filled with 6s.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nMaybe I should try to think of the transformation as follows: for each cell that is 0, replace it with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but to the left, if it's non-zero, otherwise the value of the cell in the same column but above.\n\nLet's try this with example 1's first row. The first cell is 5. Second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5, so replace with 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise the value of the cell above. For example, in example 1's first row, second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5, so replace with 5. But output is 6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero, otherwise the value of the cell above. For example, first row's second cell is 0. The cell to the right is 6 (original input's third cell), so replace with 6. That matches the output. The fourth cell is 0. The cell to the right is 5 (original input's fifth cell). But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nBut maybe there's a different rule. Like, if the cell to the right is non-zero, replace with that value. Otherwise, check the cell above. For example, in the fourth cell of example 1's first row, the cell to the right is 5 (original input's fifth cell). So replace with 5. But output is 6. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of rules that are not based on simple left/right/up/down.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the 6s and 8s are being filled based on the presence of certain numbers in the original grid. For example, in example 1, the original input has a lot of 5s and 6s, and the output fills in 6s where there are 5s. Or maybe it's based on the number of 5s in the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's output, the first row has 5 1 1 5 3 5 0 0 5. The original input's first row is 5 1 0 5 0 5 0 0 5. So the third cell (0) becomes 1, which is the same as the cell to the left. The fifth cell (0) becomes 3, which could be the sum of the cell to the left (1) and the cell to the right (5). 1+5=6, but it's 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fifth cell is replaced with the value of the cell two rows above. But that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in example 1's first row, second cell is 0. The cell above it is 0 (row 0, column 1). So that doesn't help. But in example 2's first row, third cell is 0. The cell above is 0 (row 0, column 2). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row below. For example, in example 1's first row, second cell is 0. The cell below it is 5 (row 1, column 1). So replace with 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the patterns I see in the examples.\n\nFrom example 1, it seems that certain cells are being filled with 6s and 8s. For example, in the third row, the second to fifth cells are filled with 6s. In the first row, the second, third, fourth cells are filled with 6s. In the ninth column, some cells are filled with 8s.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s if they are in certain positions, and 8s in others. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, replace with 6, and in the last column, replace with 8.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s if they are in the middle of the row or column, and 8s if they are in the last column.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the third row's ninth cell is 8, and the first row's ninth cell is 8. Maybe the ninth column is being filled with 8s in certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s if they are in the middle of the grid, and 8s if they are in the last column.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to be sure.\n\nGiven the time I have, I think I need to make a hypothesis. Let's assume that the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s if they are in the middle of the grid, and 8s in certain positions, such as the last column. But how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s if there is a 5 in the same row or column, and 8s if there is a 5 in the same row or column.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces 0s with 6s or 8s based on certain conditions. For example, replace 0s with 6 if they are in the middle of the grid, and 8s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nMaybe the following approach:\n\nFor each cell in the grid:\n\n- If the cell is 0, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If any of them are non-zero, replace with that value. If not, replace with 6 or 8 based on some condition.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise the value of the cell above.\n\nLet's try this for example 1's first row.\n\nFirst row, second cell is 0. Cell to the left is 5 (non-zero), so replace with 5. But the output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe it's the cell to the right. For example, first row, second cell is 0. Cell to the right is 6 (original input's third cell). So replace with 6. That matches the output. For the fourth cell in first row, cell to the right is 5 (original input's fifth cell). But the output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell to the left is non-zero, replace with that value, otherwise the cell to the right.\n\nIn example 1's first row, second cell is 0. Left is 5, so replace with 5. But output is 6. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the cell to the left if it's non-zero, else the cell to the right if it's non-zero, else 6 or 8.\n\nBut this is not working.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 6 if they are in the middle of the grid, and 8 if they are in the last column. For example, in example 1's first row, the ninth column is 0, and it becomes 8. In the third row, the ninth column is 0, becomes 8. So maybe the last column is being filled with 8s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle of the grid.\n\nMaybe for cells in rows 0-2 and columns 1-4, replace 0 with 6. For cells in column 8 (last column), replace 0 with 8.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nLet's try this for example 1's first row. The second cell is in row 0, column 1. So replace with 6. The fourth cell is column 3, which is in the middle. So replace with 6. The ninth cell is column 8, so replace with 8. That matches the output. For the third row's second to fifth columns, which are columns 1-4, replace with 6. That matches the output.\n\nFor example 2's first row, third cell is column 2, which is in the middle. So replace with 6. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is more complex. Maybe it's based on the sum of the row and column indices.\n\nFor example, if (row + column) is even, replace with 6, else 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 1's first row, second cell (row 0, column 1): 0+1=1, odd, so replace with 8. But the output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if (row + column) is less than 5, replace with 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nThis is really challenging. I think I need to make a function that replaces 0s with 6s or 8s based on certain conditions, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- For each cell in the grid, if it's 0, replace it with 6 if it's in the middle of the grid (like rows 1-3, columns 1-4), and 8 if it's in the last column.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6 if there's a 5 in the same row or column, and 8 if there's a 5 in the same row or column.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to make a function that replaces 0s with 6 or 8 based on their position. For example, replace 0s with 6 if they are in the middle of the grid, and 8 if they are in the last column.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- For each cell (i, j):\n\n   if grid[i][j] is 0:\n\n      if j is 8 (last column), replace with 8\n\n      else if i is in the middle rows (like 1-3), and j is in the middle columns (like 1-4), replace with 6\n\n      else, replace with 6 or 8 based on some other condition.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6 if the cell is in the first three rows and columns 1-4, and 8 in the last column.\n\nBut this is not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6 if the cell is in the middle of the grid, and 8 in the last column.\n\nLet's code this and see if it works for the examples.\n\nFor example 1's first row, second cell (row 0, column 1): not in the middle rows (assuming middle rows are 1-3), so replace with 6? But according to the hypothesis, if j is not 8, then replace with 6. But the output is 6. So that fits.\n\nFor the fourth cell (row 0, column 3): not in the middle rows, so replace with 6. Which fits the output.\n\nFor the ninth column (j=8), replace with 8. Which fits.\n\nFor example 1's third row (row 2), columns 1-4: replace with 6. Which fits the output.\n\nFor example 2's first row, third cell (row 0, column 2): not in middle rows, so replace with 6. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the transformation is more complex. Maybe it's based on the original grid's values.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but if that cell is 5, replace with 6, if it's 8, replace with 8.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces 0s with 6 or 8 based on certain conditions, even if it's not perfect. For example, replace 0s with 6 if they are in the middle of the grid, and 8 if they are in the last column.\n\nHere's the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(9):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                if j == 8:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                else:\n                    # check if it's in the middle of the grid\n                    if i in [1, 2, 3] and j in [1, 2, 3, 4]:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 6\n                    else:\n                        # default to 6 or 8 based on some other condition\n                        # for example, if it's in the last column, but already handled\n                        # or if it's in the first column\n                        transformed[i][j] = 6\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with example 1.\n\nExample 1's first row, second cell (i=0, j=1). j is not 8, and i is 0, which is not in [1,2,3]. So it would be 6. Which matches the output. Fourth cell (j=3) is in [1,2,3,4], so 6. Ninth cell is 8. So that fits.\n\nExample 1's third row (i=2), j=1-4: 6. Which matches.\n\nExample 2's first row, third cell (i=0, j=2). i is 0, not in [1,2,3]. So it would be 6. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is more complex. Perhaps it's based on the value of the cell to the left or above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise the value of the cell above.\n\nLet's try this for example 1's first row, second cell. Cell to the left is 5, so replace with 5. But output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, third cell is 6, so it's not 0. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces 0s with 6 or 8 based on the position, even if it's not perfect.\n\nThe final answer would be a function that replaces 0s with 6 or 8 based on certain conditions. But I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed with this approach.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 9x9 grid. The output also is 9x9. Let me compare some cells. For instance, the first row of input is 5 0 6 0 5 0 0 5 0. The output first row is 5 6 6 6 5 0 0 5 8. So, the first cell remains 5. The second cell was 0 in input, but in output it's 6. The third cell was 6, stays 6. Fourth cell was 0, becomes 6. Fifth cell was 5, stays 5. Sixth was 0, becomes 0. Seventh was 0, stays 0. Eighth was 5, stays 5. Ninth was 0, becomes 8. Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe some kind of propagation or filling in based on neighbors?\n\nLooking at the second row of input: 0 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0. Output is 0 5 6 5 5 5 0 5 8. So the third cell was 0, becomes 6. The ninth cell was 0, becomes 8. Maybe the 6 and 8 are appearing in certain positions. Let me check other rows.\n\nIn Example 1's third row input: 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 0. Output is 5 6 6 6 6 5 5 8 8. So the second cell was 0, becomes 6. Third cell 0 becomes 6. Fourth 0 becomes 6. Fifth 0 becomes 6. Sixth 5 stays. Seventh 5 stays. Eighth 8 stays. Ninth 0 becomes 8. So maybe in some regions, certain numbers are being filled in based on surrounding cells?\n\nLooking at Example 2. Input first row is 5 1 0 5 0 5 0 0 5. Output first row is 5 1 1 5 3 5 0 0 5. So the third cell was 0, becomes 1. The fifth cell was 0, becomes 3. The second cell remains 1. The fourth cell remains 5. The sixth remains 5. The seventh and eighth are 0. The ninth is 5. So maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are filled with numbers based on adjacent cells. Like, maybe if a cell is 0, it's replaced with a number that's derived from nearby cells. For example, in the third cell of the first row, maybe it's looking at the cell to the left (which is 1) and the cell above (which is 5 in the first row of input?), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain cells are filled based on their position. For instance, maybe cells in certain positions (like the middle) are being filled with specific numbers. Or perhaps there's a rule where if a cell is 0, it's replaced with a number based on the sum of surrounding cells or something similar.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the outputs. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The second row starts with 0, 5, 6, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 8. The third row starts with 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 8, 8. So maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being filled with 6s or 8s based on their position. For example, in the first row, the third, fourth, and fifth cells are 6, 6, 6. Then in the third row, the second, third, fourth, fifth cells are 6, 6, 6, 6. Maybe there's a horizontal or vertical pattern where certain cells are filled with 6s or 8s.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the first row has 5, 1, 1, 5, 3, 5, 0, 0, 5. The second row is 5, 1, 1, 5, 3, 3, 5, 0, 5. Third row is 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 3, 5, 0, 0. So in the first two rows, the third cell is 1, then 1, then 5, etc. Maybe the 1s and 3s are appearing in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is based on some kind of propagation where 0s are replaced with numbers that are derived from adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with numbers that are determined by the closest non-zero cells. For example, in the first example's first row, the third cell was 6, which is the same as the input's third cell. But in the second row, the third cell was 0, and in the output it's 6. Maybe the 6s are filling in certain positions where there's a 5 or 6 nearby.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are filled with numbers that are the same as the numbers in the original grid but in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 5 6 6 6 6 5 5 8 8. The original input's third row was 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 0. So the 6s are filling in the second, third, fourth, fifth positions. Maybe those positions are being filled with 6s based on some rule.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's output, the ninth column has 8 in several positions. For example, the first row's ninth cell is 8, the second row's ninth is 8, third row's ninth is 8, etc. So maybe the ninth column is being filled with 8s in certain positions. But in the input, the ninth column had 0s in many places. So perhaps the 8s are being filled in certain positions based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing 0s with numbers based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the middle of a certain region, it's filled with 6 or 8. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The test input is a 9x9 grid. The output is not given, but the task is to find the transformation. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with numbers based on some pattern, like the sum of the surrounding cells or something else.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for patterns in the outputs. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The original input's first row was 5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0. So the 0s in positions 2, 4, 6, 9 are being replaced with 6, 6, 0, 8. Wait, position 6 was 0 in input and remains 0 in output. So that's not a pattern. But position 2 was 0 and becomes 6. Position 4 was 0 and becomes 6. Position 9 was 0 and becomes 8. So maybe for some positions, the 0s are replaced with 6 or 8 based on their location.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with numbers that are the same as the numbers in the original grid's surrounding cells. For example, in the first row, the third cell was 6 in input, and in the output it's 6. The fourth cell was 0 in input, and in output it's 6. Maybe that's because the third cell is 6, so the fourth cell is filled with 6. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left or above. For example, in the first row, the second cell was 0. The cell to the left (position 1) is 5, but the output is 6. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the sum of surrounding cells. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are filled with numbers based on their row and column. For example, in the first example, the third row of output has 5 6 6 6 6 5 5 8 8. The original input's third row was 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 0. So the second to fifth cells are filled with 6s. Maybe those positions are being filled with 6s because they are in a certain range of rows and columns. For example, if the row is 3 (third row), then the second to fifth columns are filled with 6s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the same value as the cell to the right or left. For example, in the first row of example 1, the second cell is 0. The cell to the right is 6, so it becomes 6. The fourth cell is 0, the cell to the right is 5 (original input's fourth cell is 0, fifth is 5). But in the output, the fourth cell is 6. That doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of non-zero cells in the row or column. For example, if a cell is 0, replace it with the count of non-zero cells in that row or column. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The first row input was 5 1 0 5 0 5 0 0 5. The output is 5 1 1 5 3 5 0 0 5. So the third cell was 0, becomes 1. The fifth cell was 0, becomes 3. The seventh and eighth are 0, but in output they are 0 and 0. So maybe the third cell is filled with 1, which is the same as the cell to the left (which is 1). The fifth cell is filled with 3, which could be the sum of some adjacent cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in the first row of example 2, the third cell is 0. The cell in the same column (third column) in the row above (second row) is 0. But that doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of propagation. For example, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in its row or column. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the 6s and 8s are being filled in certain regions. For example, in example 1, the third row's second to fifth columns are 6s. Maybe that's because those positions are in a certain area of the grid. Like, if the row is in the middle, then certain columns are filled with 6s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the 6s and 8s are being filled in such a way that they form certain patterns. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The second row has 0, 5, 6, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 8. The third row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 8, 8. So the 6s are forming a kind of horizontal line in the middle of the grid. Maybe that's a clue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell above it (row 0, column 1) is 0. But that doesn't help. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. For example, in example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell to the right is 6 (original input's third cell). So the second cell becomes 6. Then the fourth cell is 0, the cell to the right is 5 (original input's fifth cell). But in the output, the fourth cell is 6. That doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but to the left. For example, in example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5. But the output is 6. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting a bit frustrating. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the outputs of the examples.\n\nIn example 1, the output's first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The original input's first row is 5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0. So the 0s in positions 2, 4, 6, 9 are replaced with 6, 6, 0, 8. Wait, position 6 is 0 and remains 0. So maybe not. But position 2 and 4 are replaced with 6. Position 9 is replaced with 8. So maybe the 6s are in positions where there are certain conditions.\n\nLooking at example 2's output, the first row has 5, 1, 1, 5, 3, 5, 0, 0, 5. The input's first row is 5, 1, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5. So the third cell (0) becomes 1, fifth (0) becomes 3. The seventh and eighth are 0 and remain 0. So maybe the third cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left (which is 1), and the fifth cell is replaced with 3, which could be the sum of some cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell above it (row 0, column 1) is 0. Not helpful. But in example 2's first row, third cell is 0. The cell above it (row 0, column 2) is 0. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 5s in the row or column. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the 6 and 8 are being filled in certain positions based on their row and column indices. For example, in example 1, the third row's second to fifth columns are 6s. The third row is row index 2 (assuming 0-based). Maybe if the row is in the middle, then certain columns are filled with 6s. Similarly, the ninth column in the output has 8s in some positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but in the next column. For example, if a cell is 0, replace it with the next cell's value. But that might not work for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row below. For example, in example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell below it (row 1, column 1) is 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of rules. For example, if a cell is 0, replace it with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise the value of the cell above. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the nearest non-zero cell in the same row or column. For example, in example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The nearest non-zero to the left is 5 (cell 0), so it becomes 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the outputs of the examples. For example, in example 1's output, the third row has 5 6 6 6 6 5 5 8 8. The original input's third row was 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 8 0. So the second to fifth cells are filled with 6s. Maybe those positions are in the middle of the row. Similarly, in the first row, positions 2, 3, 4 are filled with 6s. Maybe the 6s are filling in the middle of the row. So for rows 0-2, maybe the middle three columns are filled with 6s.\n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe for certain rows, the middle columns are filled with 6s. For example, in example 1, rows 0, 1, 2 have some 6s in the middle. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s if they are in certain positions, and 8s in others. For example, in example 1, the ninth column has 8s in certain rows. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, replace with 6, else 8. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but in the column that is the same as the row index. For example, in example 1, the third row (row index 2) has 6s in columns 1-4. But that's not clear.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of rules, such as:\n\n- For each cell that is 0, replace it with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise the value of the cell above.\n\nBut I need to test this with the examples.\n\nIn example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5 (original input's first cell). So according to this rule, it would become 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value of the cell to the right. For example, in the first row's second cell (0), the cell to the right is 6 (original input's third cell). So replace with 6. Which matches the output. Then for the fourth cell (0), the cell to the right is 5 (original input's fifth cell). But the output is 6. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nBut in the first row of example 1, the fourth cell is 0. The cell to the right is 5 (original input's fifth cell), but in the output it's 6. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell to the left is non-zero, and the cell to the right is non-zero, then take the average. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the 6s and 8s are being filled in such a way that they form certain patterns. For example, in example 1's output, the 6s are filling in a horizontal line in the middle of the grid. Maybe that's a clue that the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s in certain regions.\n\nBut how to determine which regions. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s if they are in the middle of the grid. For example, if the row and column are in the middle range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s in certain positions based on the original grid's values. For example, if there's a 5 in the original grid, then the neighboring cells are filled with 6s.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nMaybe I should try to think of the transformation as follows: for each cell that is 0, replace it with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row but to the left, if it's non-zero, otherwise the value of the cell in the same column but above.\n\nLet's try this with example 1's first row. The first cell is 5. Second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5, so replace with 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise the value of the cell above. For example, in example 1's first row, second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5, so replace with 5. But output is 6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero, otherwise the value of the cell above. For example, first row's second cell is 0. The cell to the right is 6 (original input's third cell), so replace with 6. That matches the output. The fourth cell is 0. The cell to the right is 5 (original input's fifth cell). But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nBut maybe there's a different rule. Like, if the cell to the right is non-zero, replace with that value. Otherwise, check the cell above. For example, in the fourth cell of example 1's first row, the cell to the right is 5 (original input's fifth cell). So replace with 5. But output is 6. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of rules that are not based on simple left/right/up/down.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the 6s and 8s are being filled based on the presence of certain numbers in the original grid. For example, in example 1, the original input has a lot of 5s and 6s, and the output fills in 6s where there are 5s. Or maybe it's based on the number of 5s in the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's output, the first row has 5 1 1 5 3 5 0 0 5. The original input's first row is 5 1 0 5 0 5 0 0 5. So the third cell (0) becomes 1, which is the same as the cell to the left. The fifth cell (0) becomes 3, which could be the sum of the cell to the left (1) and the cell to the right (5). 1+5=6, but it's 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fifth cell is replaced with the value of the cell two rows above. But that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in example 1's first row, second cell is 0. The cell above it is 0 (row 0, column 1). So that doesn't help. But in example 2's first row, third cell is 0. The cell above is 0 (row 0, column 2). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row below. For example, in example 1's first row, second cell is 0. The cell below it is 5 (row 1, column 1). So replace with 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the patterns I see in the examples.\n\nFrom example 1, it seems that certain cells are being filled with 6s and 8s. For example, in the third row, the second to fifth cells are filled with 6s. In the first row, the second, third, fourth cells are filled with 6s. In the ninth column, some cells are filled with 8s.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s if they are in certain positions, and 8s in others. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, replace with 6, and in the last column, replace with 8.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s if they are in the middle of the row or column, and 8s if they are in the last column.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the third row's ninth cell is 8, and the first row's ninth cell is 8. Maybe the ninth column is being filled with 8s in certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s if they are in the middle of the grid, and 8s if they are in the last column.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to be sure.\n\nGiven the time I have, I think I need to make a hypothesis. Let's assume that the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s if they are in the middle of the grid, and 8s in certain positions, such as the last column. But how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6s if there is a 5 in the same row or column, and 8s if there is a 5 in the same row or column.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but that's not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces 0s with 6s or 8s based on certain conditions. For example, replace 0s with 6 if they are in the middle of the grid, and 8s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nMaybe the following approach:\n\nFor each cell in the grid:\n\n- If the cell is 0, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If any of them are non-zero, replace with that value. If not, replace with 6 or 8 based on some condition.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise the value of the cell above.\n\nLet's try this for example 1's first row.\n\nFirst row, second cell is 0. Cell to the left is 5 (non-zero), so replace with 5. But the output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe it's the cell to the right. For example, first row, second cell is 0. Cell to the right is 6 (original input's third cell). So replace with 6. That matches the output. For the fourth cell in first row, cell to the right is 5 (original input's fifth cell). But the output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell to the left is non-zero, replace with that value, otherwise the cell to the right.\n\nIn example 1's first row, second cell is 0. Left is 5, so replace with 5. But output is 6. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the cell to the left if it's non-zero, else the cell to the right if it's non-zero, else 6 or 8.\n\nBut this is not working.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 6 if they are in the middle of the grid, and 8 if they are in the last column. For example, in example 1's first row, the ninth column is 0, and it becomes 8. In the third row, the ninth column is 0, becomes 8. So maybe the last column is being filled with 8s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle of the grid.\n\nMaybe for cells in rows 0-2 and columns 1-4, replace 0 with 6. For cells in column 8 (last column), replace 0 with 8.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nLet's try this for example 1's first row. The second cell is in row 0, column 1. So replace with 6. The fourth cell is column 3, which is in the middle. So replace with 6. The ninth cell is column 8, so replace with 8. That matches the output. For the third row's second to fifth columns, which are columns 1-4, replace with 6. That matches the output.\n\nFor example 2's first row, third cell is column 2, which is in the middle. So replace with 6. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is more complex. Maybe it's based on the sum of the row and column indices.\n\nFor example, if (row + column) is even, replace with 6, else 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 1's first row, second cell (row 0, column 1): 0+1=1, odd, so replace with 8. But the output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if (row + column) is less than 5, replace with 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nThis is really challenging. I think I need to make a function that replaces 0s with 6s or 8s based on certain conditions, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- For each cell in the grid, if it's 0, replace it with 6 if it's in the middle of the grid (like rows 1-3, columns 1-4), and 8 if it's in the last column.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6 if there's a 5 in the same row or column, and 8 if there's a 5 in the same row or column.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to make a function that replaces 0s with 6 or 8 based on their position. For example, replace 0s with 6 if they are in the middle of the grid, and 8 if they are in the last column.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- For each cell (i, j):\n\n   if grid[i][j] is 0:\n\n      if j is 8 (last column), replace with 8\n\n      else if i is in the middle rows (like 1-3), and j is in the middle columns (like 1-4), replace with 6\n\n      else, replace with 6 or 8 based on some other condition.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6 if the cell is in the first three rows and columns 1-4, and 8 in the last column.\n\nBut this is not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 6 if the cell is in the middle of the grid, and 8 in the last column.\n\nLet's code this and see if it works for the examples.\n\nFor example 1's first row, second cell (row 0, column 1): not in the middle rows (assuming middle rows are 1-3), so replace with 6? But according to the hypothesis, if j is not 8, then replace with 6. But the output is 6. So that fits.\n\nFor the fourth cell (row 0, column 3): not in the middle rows, so replace with 6. Which fits the output.\n\nFor the ninth column (j=8), replace with 8. Which fits.\n\nFor example 1's third row (row 2), columns 1-4: replace with 6. Which fits the output.\n\nFor example 2's first row, third cell (row 0, column 2): not in middle rows, so replace with 6. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the transformation is more complex. Maybe it's based on the original grid's values.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell in the same row and column, but if that cell is 5, replace with 6, if it's 8, replace with 8.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces 0s with 6 or 8 based on certain conditions, even if it's not perfect. For example, replace 0s with 6 if they are in the middle of the grid, and 8 if they are in the last column.\n\nHere's the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(9):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                if j == 8:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                else:\n                    # check if it's in the middle of the grid\n                    if i in [1, 2, 3] and j in [1, 2, 3, 4]:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 6\n                    else:\n                        # default to 6 or 8 based on some other condition\n                        # for example, if it's in the last column, but already handled\n                        # or if it's in the first column\n                        transformed[i][j] = 6\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with example 1.\n\nExample 1's first row, second cell (i=0, j=1). j is not 8, and i is 0, which is not in [1,2,3]. So it would be 6. Which matches the output. Fourth cell (j=3) is in [1,2,3,4], so 6. Ninth cell is 8. So that fits.\n\nExample 1's third row (i=2), j=1-4: 6. Which matches.\n\nExample 2's first row, third cell (i=0, j=2). i is 0, not in [1,2,3]. So it would be 6. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is more complex. Perhaps it's based on the value of the cell to the left or above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise the value of the cell above.\n\nLet's try this for example 1's first row, second cell. Cell to the left is 5, so replace with 5. But output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, third cell is 6, so it's not 0. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces 0s with 6 or 8 based on the position, even if it's not perfect.\n\nThe final answer would be a function that replaces 0s with 6 or 8 based on certain conditions. But I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed with this approach.\n"
