          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, there are three examples given. Let me look at each one carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 7x9 grid. The output is also 7x9. Let me compare the input and output. The input has some numbers in certain positions. For instance, in the fourth row of the input, there's a 3, 2, 5. The output's fourth row has 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. Wait, the 5 and 2 are in positions 5 and 6 (if we count from 0?), but in the output, the 5 is in position 4 (since the output row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0). Wait, maybe the numbers are being moved or transformed in some way.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the third row of the output has 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. The input's third row was 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the input's fourth row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the numbers 3, 2, 5 in the input's fourth row are moved to positions 4, 5, 6 in the output's fourth row? Wait, the original input's fourth row has 3 in column 2 (0-based?), 2 in column 3, 5 in column 4. In the output, the fourth row has 5 in column 4, 2 in column 5, 3 in column 6. So it seems like the numbers are being shifted to the right by two positions? Or maybe rotated?\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are being rotated in some way. Let me check other rows. For example, the fifth row of the input is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Hmm, that's not helpful. Wait, the output's third row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. The input's third row was all zeros. So maybe that's not related.\n\nLooking at the second example. Input is 3x3 grid. Output is 3x3. The input is:\n\n6 0 0\n\n2 5 0\n\n2 1 0\n\nOutput is:\n\n0 1 2\n\n0 5 2\n\n0 0 6\n\nSo the output seems to have the numbers rearranged. Let's see. The original input's first row is 6, 0, 0. The output's first row is 0, 1, 2. The second row of input is 2,5,0 \u2192 output is 0,5,2. Third row input is 2,1,0 \u2192 output is 0,0,6. Hmm. So maybe the numbers are being rotated in some way. For example, in the first row of the input, the 6 is moved to the third column of the output's third row. The 1 and 2 in the input's third row are moved to the first and second positions of the output's first row. Wait, maybe the numbers are being arranged in a certain order. Like, the output's first row is 0 1 2, which is the numbers 1, 2, 6? No, the input's first row is 6, 0, 0. The output's first row is 0,1,2. But where do these numbers come from? The input's third row has 2,1,0. The output's first row is 0,1,2. So maybe the numbers are being sorted in some way, but that's not clear.\n\nLooking at the third example. Input is a 9x9 grid. The output is also 9x9. Let me check the input and output. For example, the third row of the input is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 3s and 5 are moved. The original input's third row has 3,3,5 in positions 1,2,3. The output's third row has 5 in position 3, 3 in position 4 and 5. So maybe the numbers are being shifted to the right by two positions? Or perhaps some kind of rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved in a certain pattern. For example, in the third example, the input's fourth row is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So the 1s are moved to the sixth and seventh columns. Hmm. Maybe the numbers are being shifted to the right by certain positions.\n\nLooking at the first example again, the input's fourth row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the 3, 2, 5 in the input's row are now in positions 4,5,6 of the output's row. Wait, the original positions were 2,3,4 (columns 2,3,4). In the output, they are in positions 4,5,6. So that's a shift of two positions to the right. But then, in the third row of the output, there's 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. The input's third row was all zeros. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being rotated in a certain way. For example, in the first example, the numbers in the input's fourth row are 3, 2, 5. The output's fourth row has 5, 2, 3. So the order is reversed. But that's not the case. The original order is 3, 2, 5. The output's fourth row has 5, 2, 3. So the first and third elements are swapped. So maybe the numbers are being rotated in a certain way.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the numbers are being moved in a way that depends on their position. For example, in the first example, the input's fourth row has 3 in column 2, 2 in column 3, 5 in column 4. The output's fourth row has 5 in column 4, 2 in column 5, 3 in column 6. So the numbers are shifted to the right by two positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved in a certain pattern based on their value. For example, the 3 and 2 in the input are moved to the right, but the 5 is moved as well. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at the second example again. The input is:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 2\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6\n\nSo in the output, the numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, 2 are arranged. The 6 is moved to the third column of the third row. The 1 is in the second column of the first row. The 2 is in the third column of the first row. The 5 is in the second column of the second row. The 2 in the third row is moved to the third column of the second row.\n\nThis seems like the numbers are being sorted in a certain way. For example, the output's first row is 0 1 2. The input's third row has 2, 1, 0. So maybe the numbers are being sorted in some order. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being rotated in a certain way. For example, the output's first row is 0 1 2. The input's third row is 2 1 0. So maybe the numbers are being reversed and then shifted. For example, the third row's numbers are 2,1,0. Reversed, it's 0,1,2. Then placed in the first row. But how does that fit with other rows?\n\nIn the second example, the output's second row is 0 5 2. The input's second row is 2 5 0. If we take the 5 and 2, maybe they are moved. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the numbers are being moved based on their position in the grid. For example, in the third example, the input's third row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 5 is moved to column 3, and the 3s are moved to columns 4 and 5. So maybe the numbers are being shifted to the right by two positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved in a way that depends on their value. For example, numbers in the input are being moved to the right by two positions, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotation of the input. For example, in the first example, the fourth row of the input has 3, 2, 5. The output's fourth row has 5, 2, 3. So the order is reversed. But that's just three numbers. Maybe the entire grid is rotated.\n\nBut that's not possible because the input and output sizes are the same. For example, the first example's input is 7x9. The output is also 7x9. So maybe the transformation is not a rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain numbers are moved to specific positions based on their value. For example, in the first example, the 3s and 2s are moved to certain positions. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the third example. The input's third row has 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 5 is moved to column 3, and the 3s are moved to columns 4 and 5. So maybe the 5 is moved to the left by two positions, and the 3s are moved to the right by two positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved in a way that depends on their position. For example, in the first example's fourth row, the 3 is in column 2, and in the output it's in column 6. That's a shift of 4 positions to the right. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved in a certain pattern based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 3 in the input's fourth row is moved to the output's fourth row, column 6. The 2 is moved to column 5. The 5 is moved to column 4. So the numbers are shifted to the right by two positions. Wait, original positions are 2,3,4. Output positions are 4,5,6. So that's a shift of +2 positions. But why?\n\nIn the third example's third row, the input has 3,3,5 in columns 1,2,3. The output has 5 in column 3, 3 in columns 4 and 5. So that's a shift of +2 positions for the 5 (from column 3 to 3? No. Wait, original input is column 3 (0-based?), and output is column 3. Hmm, that's not a shift. Maybe the 5 is moved to column 3, and the 3s are moved to columns 4 and 5. So maybe the 5 is moved to the same column, but the 3s are shifted right by two.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the examples and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nLooking at Example 2 again. The input is:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 2\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6\n\nSo the output's first row is 0 1 2. The input's third row is 2 1 0. So the numbers 2,1,0 are reversed and placed in the first row. The output's second row is 0 5 2. The input's second row is 2 5 0. So the 5 and 2 are moved. The third row of the output is 0 0 6, which is the input's first row's 6 moved to the end.\n\nSo perhaps the numbers are being sorted in some way. For example, the first row of the output is the reversed third row of the input. The second row is the second row of the input with the 0 moved to the front. The third row is the first row's 6 moved to the end.\n\nThis seems like a possible pattern. But how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotation of the input. For example, in the second example, the output's first row is the third row of the input reversed. The second row is the second row of the input with the 0 moved to the front. The third row is the first row's 6 moved to the end. But this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain numbers are moved to specific positions based on their value. For example, in the second example, the 6 is moved to the third column of the third row. The 1 and 2 are moved to the first row.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to all three examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the third example. The input's fourth row is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So the 1s are moved to positions 5 and 6. So maybe the numbers are being shifted to the right by five positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the right by two positions, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the numbers in the fourth row are shifted to the right by two positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved in a way that depends on their value. For example, numbers with higher values are moved to the right, lower values to the left. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a transformation where the numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 3 is in column 2 of the input's fourth row. In the output's fourth row, it's in column 6. So that's a shift of +4 positions. The 2 is in column 3, shifted to 5 (shift +2). The 5 is in column 4, shifted to 4 (no shift). This doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being rotated in a certain way. For example, the numbers in the input's fourth row are being rotated to the right by two positions. But that would make 3,2,5 \u2192 5,3,2. But the output's fourth row is 5,2,3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the output of example 1, the third row of the output is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. The input's third row was all zeros. So maybe that's not related. But the input's fifth row is 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain numbers are moved to specific positions based on their value. For example, in the first example, the 3 and 2 are moved to the right, and the 5 is moved to the left. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nAt this point, it's challenging to find a consistent pattern. Maybe I should look for a transformation that can explain all three examples.\n\nLooking at example 2 again. The output is a rearrangement of the input's numbers. The numbers in the output are the same as the input's numbers. For example, the input has 6, 2, 5, 2, 1. The output has 0,1,2,0,5,2,0,0,6. So the numbers 6, 2, 5, 2, 1 are present in the output. The zeros are added as well.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is generated by taking the input's numbers and rearranging them in a certain way. For example, in example 2, the output's first row is 0 1 2, which are the numbers from the input's third row (2,1,0) reversed. The second row is 0 5 2, which is the input's second row (2,5,0) with the 0 moved to the front. The third row is 0 0 6, which is the input's first row (6,0,0) with the 6 moved to the end.\n\nThis suggests that the output is a rearrangement of the input's rows, possibly in a certain order. For example, the third row of the input becomes the first row of the output, reversed. The second row of the input becomes the second row of the output, with the 0 moved to the front. The first row of the input becomes the third row of the output, with the 6 moved to the end.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the rows are being reordered and transformed in some way. For example, in example 2, the rows are being reordered as third, second, first. And then each row is transformed.\n\nBut how to apply this to the other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the input's fourth row is transformed into the output's fourth row. The input's third row is all zeros, and the output's third row has 3s and 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is more about the positions of the non-zero numbers. For example, in example 2, the non-zero numbers are 6, 2, 5, 2, 1. The output has them arranged in a certain way.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is a rotation of the input. For example, in example 2, the input is a 3x3 grid. The output is also 3x3. If we rotate the input 90 degrees clockwise, would that match the output? Let's see.\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0 \u2192 [6, 0, 0]\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0 \u2192 [2, 5, 0]\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0 \u2192 [2, 1, 0]\n\nRotating 90 degrees clockwise would result in:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 2 \u2192 [0,5,2]\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2 \u2192 [0,5,2]\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6 \u2192 [0,0,6]\n\nBut the output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 2\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6\n\nSo that's not matching. So rotation doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transpose of the input. But the transpose of example 2's input would be:\n\nRow 0: 6 2 2 \u2192 [6,2,2]\n\nRow 1: 0 5 1 \u2192 [0,5,1]\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nWhich is not matching the output.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation involves taking the numbers in certain positions and moving them to others. For example, in example 2, the 1 is moved to the first row's second column. The 2 is moved to first row's third column. The 5 is in the second row's second column. The 6 is moved to third row's third column.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the numbers in the input and arrange them in a certain order based on their value. For example, in example 2, the numbers are 6, 2, 5, 2, 1. The output's first row is 0 1 2, which are the numbers 1, 2, 2. But the input has two 2s. The output's second row is 0 5 2. The third row is 0 0 6. So the numbers are sorted in some way.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being sorted in the output, but that doesn't fit the first example. In example 1, the output has 3s and 5s in certain positions.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can explain all three examples. Let's think about the third example again.\n\nIn example 3, the input's third row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 5 is in column 3, and the 3s are in columns 4 and 5. So the 5 is moved to the same column, and the 3s are shifted right by two positions. The input's fourth row is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So the 1s are moved to columns 5 and 6. This suggests that the numbers are being shifted to the right by two positions. But why?\n\nIn example 1, the fourth row has 3, 2, 5. The output's fourth row has 5, 2, 3. So the 3 is moved to column 6, 2 to column 5, 5 to column 4. This is a shift of two positions to the right. But the 5 is in the original position 4, and in the output it's in position 4. So that's not a shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being rotated in a certain way. For example, the 3, 2, 5 in the input's fourth row are rotated to the right by two positions. So 3, 2, 5 \u2192 5, 3, 2. But the output is 5, 2, 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the numbers are being moved based on their value. For example, higher numbers are moved to the right, lower numbers to the left. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the numbers in the input and replace them with their positions in a certain way. For example, in example 2, the output's first row is 0 1 2, which could be the positions of the numbers in the input's third row. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. However, I need to write a function that can handle these examples. Let's think of possible transformations that could fit.\n\nLooking at the third example, the output's third row has the 5 in column 3 and the 3s in columns 4 and 5. The input's third row has 3,3,5 in columns 1,2,3. So the 5 is moved to column 3, and the 3s are moved to columns 4 and 5. This suggests that the 5 is moved to the same column, and the 3s are shifted right by two positions. But why?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to shift all non-zero numbers to the right by two positions. But in example 1, the fourth row's 3,2,5 are shifted to the right by two positions, but the 5 is in the same column. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to shift all non-zero numbers to the right by two positions, but if they are at the end of the row, they stay. For example, in the third example's third row, the 5 is in column 3. Shifting right by two would put it in column 5, but in the output it's in column 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved in a way that depends on their row. For example, in the first example, the fourth row is transformed, but the third row is not. This is too vague.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and applying a certain transformation to each cell. For example, in example 2, the output's first row is 0 1 2. The input's third row is 2 1 0. So the numbers are reversed. The second row of the output is 0 5 2, which is the input's second row (2 5 0) with the 0 moved to the front. The third row is 0 0 6, which is the input's first row (6 0 0) with the 6 moved to the end.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation for each row is to reverse the row and then move the zeros to the end or something like that. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the input and for each row, reverse the non-zero elements and place them in certain positions. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess. Let's think of a possible transformation that could work for the examples.\n\nIn example 2, the output's first row is 0 1 2. This is the third row of the input (2 1 0) reversed. The second row of the output is 0 5 2, which is the second row of the input (2 5 0) with the 0 moved to the front. The third row of the output is 0 0 6, which is the first row of the input (6 0 0) with the 6 moved to the end.\n\nSo it seems like the rows are being reordered as third, second, first, and each row is transformed in a certain way. For example, the third row is reversed, the second row has the 0 moved to the front, and the first row has the 6 moved to the end.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation involves reordering the rows and then transforming each row. But how to apply this to other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the input's fourth row is transformed into the output's fourth row. The input's third row is all zeros. The output's third row has 3s and 3s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the input and for each row, if it contains certain values, move them to specific positions. But without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother idea: in example 2, the output's first row is the third row of the input reversed. The second row is the second row of the input with the 0 moved to the front. The third row is the first row of the input with the 6 moved to the end. So the rows are being reordered and transformed in a certain way. This could be a possible pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize this to other examples?\n\nFor example, in example 1, the fourth row of the input is transformed into the output's fourth row. The input's fourth row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the 3, 2, 5 are moved to the right by two positions. The 5 is in position 4, 2 in 5, 3 in 6. So the 3 and 2 are shifted to the right by two, and the 5 stays in place.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation for a row is to shift the non-zero elements to the right by two positions. But why?\n\nIn example 3, the third row of the input is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 5 is in column 3, and the 3s are in columns 4 and 5. This could be a shift of two positions to the right for the 3s and 5. But how?\n\nThis suggests that non-zero elements are shifted to the right by two positions, but if they are at the end of the row, they stay. So for example, in the third row of example 3, the 5 is at position 3. Shifting right by two would put it at position 5, but in the output it's at position 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. But perhaps the transformation is to shift all non-zero elements to the right by two positions, and fill the left with zeros. For example, in example 1's fourth row: 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0 \u2192 after shifting right by two, it would be 0 0 0 0 3 2 5 0 0, but the output is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero elements are reversed and shifted. For example, in the fourth row of example 1, the non-zero elements are 3, 2, 5. Reversed, they are 5, 2, 3. Then shifted right by two positions? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to rotate the non-zero elements in the row. For example, in example 1's fourth row, the non-zero elements are 3, 2, 5. Rotated to the right by two positions would give 5, 3, 2. But the output is 5, 2, 3. So that's not matching.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I need to make a hypothesis. Let's assume that the transformation involves shifting non-zero elements to the right by two positions, and filling the left with zeros. Let's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput row 0: 6 0 0 \u2192 non-zero elements are 6. Shift right by two positions: 0 0 6 \u2192 which matches the output's third row.\n\nInput row 1: 2 5 0 \u2192 non-zero elements are 2, 5. Shift right by two positions: 0 0 2 5 \u2192 but the row is 3 elements. So shifting right by two positions would mean moving 2 and 5 to the end. So the row becomes 0 5 2 \u2192 which matches the output's second row.\n\nInput row 2: 2 1 0 \u2192 non-zero elements are 2, 1. Shift right by two positions: 0 1 2 \u2192 which matches the output's first row.\n\nThis seems to fit example 2.\n\nExample 1's fourth row: input is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. Non-zero elements are 3, 2, 5. Shifting right by two positions would mean moving them to the right by two, but since the row is 9 elements, shifting right by two would mean that the non-zero elements are moved to the end. So the row would be 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 5. But the output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this hypothesis works for example 2 but not for example 1. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to shift non-zero elements to the right by two positions, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in example 1's fourth row, the 3, 2, 5 are shifted to the right by two positions, but the 5 is moved to the fifth column (original position 4 + 2 = 6?), but the output has 5 in column 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: in example 1, the fourth row of the input has 3, 2, 5. The output's fourth row has 5, 2, 3. This is the reversed order of the non-zero elements. So maybe the non-zero elements are reversed and then shifted to the right by two positions. For example, 3, 2, 5 \u2192 reversed is 5, 2, 3 \u2192 then shifted right by two positions would be 0 0 5 2 3 0 0 0 0. But the output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero elements are reversed and placed in the middle of the row. For example, in example 1's fourth row, the non-zero elements are 3, 2, 5 \u2192 reversed is 5, 2, 3. Placed in positions 4, 5, 6. Which matches the output's fourth row. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn example 3's third row, the input is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. Non-zero elements are 3, 3, 5. Reversed is 5, 3, 3. Placed in positions 3, 4, 5. Which matches the output's third row (0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0).\n\nIn example 2's first row, the non-zero elements are 6. Reversed is 6. Placed in the third position, which matches the output's third row.\n\nIn example 2's second row, the non-zero elements are 2, 5. Reversed is 5, 2. Placed in positions 2 and 3, which matches the output's second row (0 5 2).\n\nIn example 2's third row, the non-zero elements are 2, 1. Reversed is 1, 2. Placed in positions 1 and 2, which matches the output's first row (0 1 2).\n\nSo this seems to be a possible pattern: for each row, collect the non-zero elements, reverse them, and place them in the row starting from position 4 (for example, in example 1's fourth row, the reversed non-zero elements are placed starting at position 4). Wait, but how to determine where to start?\n\nIn example 1's fourth row, the reversed non-zero elements are placed starting at position 4. In example 3's third row, the reversed non-zero elements are placed starting at position 3. In example 2's rows, the reversed elements are placed starting at position 0 for the first row, position 0 for the second row, and position 0 for the third row. So this doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the reversed non-zero elements are placed in the middle of the row, but how?\n\nWait, in example 1's fourth row, the input has 3, 2, 5 in columns 2, 3, 4. The output has them in columns 4, 5, 6. So the reversed elements are placed starting at column 4, which is two positions to the right of their original positions.\n\nIn example 3's third row, the input has 3, 3, 5 in columns 1, 2, 3. The output has them in columns 3, 4, 5. So the reversed elements are placed starting at column 3, which is two positions to the right of their original positions.\n\nIn example 2's rows, the reversed elements are placed starting at column 0 for the first row (0 1 2), column 0 for the second row (0 5 2), and column 0 for the third row (0 0 6). So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 2, the rows are being reordered. For example, the third row of the input becomes the first row of the output, reversed. The second row becomes the second row of the output, reversed and shifted. The first row becomes the third row of the output, reversed and shifted.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is:\n\n1. Reverse the order of the rows.\n2. For each row, reverse the non-zero elements and place them in the row starting from position 4 (for example, in example 1's fourth row, the reversed non-zero elements are placed starting at position 4, which is the fifth column).\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to reverse the non-zero elements of each row and place them in the row starting from position 4, but this doesn't fit example 2.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to reverse the non-zero elements of each row and place them in the row starting from position 4, but for rows with fewer non-zero elements, it's placed at the beginning.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the non-zero elements are reversed and placed in the row starting from position 4 (for example, in example 1's fourth row), but this is not consistent with all examples. However, this seems to fit some examples.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nThe steps would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Collect the non-zero elements.\n- Reverse them.\n- Place them in the row starting from position 4, filling the rest with zeros.\n\nBut in example 2, this would not work. For example, the first row of example 2 is [6, 0, 0]. The non-zero elements are [6], reversed is [6]. Placed starting at position 4? But the row is only 3 elements. So this approach is not applicable.\n\nAnother idea: for each row, the non-zero elements are reversed and placed in the row, starting from the beginning, and the rest are filled with zeros. For example, in example 2's third row, the non-zero elements are [2, 1], reversed is [1, 2], placed at the beginning, so the row becomes [1, 2, 0]. But the output's first row is [0, 1, 2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero elements are reversed and placed in the row, but the zeros are moved to the end. For example, in example 2's third row, [2, 1, 0] \u2192 reversed non-zero elements are [1, 2], then zeros are moved to the end \u2192 [1, 2, 0]. But the output's first row is [0, 1, 2], which is different.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is more complex.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the non-zero elements are reversed and placed in the row, with zeros filling the rest. This works for example 2, but not for example 1. However, this is the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Extract non-zero elements.\n- Reverse them.\n- Create a new row with these reversed elements, followed by zeros to fill the row.\n\nBut this would not fit example 1's fourth row. Let's see:\n\nExample 1's fourth row input: [0, 0, 3, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Non-zero elements are [3, 2, 5]. Reversed is [5, 2, 3]. New row is [5, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. But the output's fourth row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 3, 0, 0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut if we shift the reversed elements to the right by two positions, it would fit. So perhaps the reversed elements are placed starting from position 4 (index 4) in the row.\n\nIn example 1's fourth row, the reversed elements are [5, 2, 3]. Placed starting at position 4 (index 4), the row would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 3, 0, 0], which matches the output.\n\nIn example 3's third row, the non-zero elements are [3, 3, 5]. Reversed is [5, 3, 3]. Placed starting at position 3 (index 3), the row becomes:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], which matches the output.\n\nIn example 2's third row, the non-zero elements are [2, 1]. Reversed is [1, 2]. Placed starting at position 0, the row becomes [1, 2, 0], but the output's first row is [0, 1, 2]. So this doesn't fit. However, in example 2, the rows are reordered. So perhaps the rows are being reversed in order, and then each row is processed.\n\nSo the transformation steps could be:\n\n1. Reverse the order of the rows.\n2. For each row, reverse the non-zero elements and place them starting at position 4 (index 4).\n\nBut in example 2, the rows are reversed in order, so the input's rows are [row0, row1, row2] \u2192 output rows are [row2, row1, row0]. Then, for each of these rows, reverse the non-zero elements and place them starting at position 4.\n\nBut for example 2's row2 (input row2 is [2, 1, 0]), reversed non-zero elements are [1, 2], placed starting at position 0 \u2192 [1, 2, 0]. But the output's first row is [0, 1, 2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero elements are placed starting at position 0, and the zeros are moved to the end. For example, in example 2's row2, [2, 1, 0] \u2192 non-zero elements [2, 1], reversed [1, 2], placed at the start, and zeros at the end \u2192 [1, 2, 0]. But the output's first row is [0, 1, 2], which is different.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the non-zero elements are reversed and placed in the row starting at position 4, and the rest are filled with zeros. This fits example 1 and example 3, but not example 2. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Collect non-zero elements.\n- Reverse them.\n- Create a new row where these reversed elements are placed starting at position 4, and the rest are zeros.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFor example, for a row of length 9:\n\nnew_row = [0] * 9\nfor i in range(len(reversed_non_zero)):\n    new_row[4 + i] = reversed_non_zero[i]\nreturn new_row\n\nBut this would work for example 1's fourth row, where reversed_non_zero is [5, 2, 3], and placed at positions 4,5,6.\n\nFor example 3's third row, reversed_non_zero is [5, 3, 3], placed at positions 3,4,5.\n\nBut for example 2's rows, this would not work. However, perhaps the rows are being reordered in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows are being reordered, and then each row is processed as described.\n\nBut without more examples, this is speculative.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        non_zero = [x for x in row if x != 0]\n        reversed_non_zero = non_zero[::-1]\n        new_row = [0]*9\n        for i in range(len(reversed_non_zero)):\n            new_row[4 + i] = reversed_non_zero[i]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle the example 2 correctly. However, it fits examples 1 and 3.\n\nBut wait, example 2's input is 3x3 grid. The code above assumes that each row is 9 elements, which is not the case. Oh, right! The training examples have different grid sizes. For example, example 2 is 3x3, but the test input is 7x9. So the code must handle different row lengths.\n\nWait, the problem says that the output must be 7x9. So the input and output grids are always 7x9. Wait, no. The training examples have different grid sizes. Example 1 is 7x9, example 2 is 3x3, example 3 is 9x9. But the test input is 7x9. So the function must handle grids of any size, but the output must always be 7x9. Wait, no. The problem says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 7\u00d79 output grid.\" So regardless of the input size, the output is 7x9. But the training examples have inputs of different sizes. So the function must take any input grid (of any size) and output a 7x9 grid.\n\nBut this is conflicting. The training examples have inputs of different sizes, but the output is always 7x9. So the function must transform any input grid into a 7x9 grid.\n\nBut this is confusing. How to handle that? Perhaps the training examples are just examples, and the function must take any input grid (of any size) and transform it into a 7x9 grid. But this is not clear. However, the problem says that the test input is 7x9, and the output must be 7x9.\n\nBut the training examples have inputs of different sizes. For example, example 2 is 3x3. How to transform it into 7x9? This suggests that the transformation is not based on the input size, but on the pattern observed in the examples.\n\nThis is a contradiction. Perhaps the training examples are not all of the same size, but the function is supposed to transform any input into a 7x9 output. But how?\n\nThis is confusing. However, the problem says that the test input is 7x9, and the output must be 7x9. So the function must take any input grid (of any size) and output a 7x9 grid. But how to determine the transformation?\n\nThis suggests that the function is supposed to transform the input into a 7x9 grid, but the training examples have inputs of different sizes. So the function must handle that.\n\nBut this makes it more complex. However, given that the training examples are provided, perhaps the transformation is based on the patterns observed in the examples, and the output is always 7x9.\n\nBut this is not clear. However, the problem says that the function must return a 7x9 grid, so the code must produce that.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation for each row is to reverse the non-zero elements and place them starting at position 4, and the rest are zeros. This would fit example 1 and 3, and perhaps the test input.\n\nFor example, the test input is 7x9. Let's look at the input:\n\nRow 5: 8 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 \u2192 non-zero elements are 8,5. Reversed is 5,8. Placed starting at position 4 (index 4), so the new row would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0]. But the output is not known, but the code would generate this.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        non_zero = [x for x in row if x != 0]\n        reversed_non_zero = non_zero[::-1]\n        new_row = [0]*9\n        for i in range(len(reversed_non_zero)):\n            new_row[4 + i] = reversed_non_zero[i]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this code would not handle example 2 correctly, but it fits examples 1 and 3.\n\nHowever, the problem says that the output must be 7x9, so the code must generate a 7x9 grid, which it does.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis based on the examples. I'm not sure if this is the correct pattern, but given the time, I'll proceed with this.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, there are three examples given. Let me look at each one carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 7x9 grid. The output is also 7x9. Let me compare the input and output. The input has some numbers in certain positions. For instance, in the fourth row of the input, there's a 3, 2, 5. The output's fourth row has 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. Wait, the 5 and 2 are in positions 5 and 6 (if we count from 0?), but in the output, the 5 is in position 4 (since the output row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0). Wait, maybe the numbers are being moved or transformed in some way.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the third row of the output has 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. The input's third row was 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the input's fourth row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the numbers 3, 2, 5 in the input's fourth row are moved to positions 4, 5, 6 in the output's fourth row? Wait, the original input's fourth row has 3 in column 2 (0-based?), 2 in column 3, 5 in column 4. In the output, the fourth row has 5 in column 4, 2 in column 5, 3 in column 6. So it seems like the numbers are being shifted to the right by two positions? Or maybe rotated?\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are being rotated in some way. Let me check other rows. For example, the fifth row of the input is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Hmm, that's not helpful. Wait, the output's third row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. The input's third row was all zeros. So maybe that's not related.\n\nLooking at the second example. Input is 3x3 grid. Output is 3x3. The input is:\n\n6 0 0\n\n2 5 0\n\n2 1 0\n\nOutput is:\n\n0 1 2\n\n0 5 2\n\n0 0 6\n\nSo the output seems to have the numbers rearranged. Let's see. The original input's first row is 6, 0, 0. The output's first row is 0, 1, 2. The second row of input is 2,5,0 \u2192 output is 0,5,2. Third row input is 2,1,0 \u2192 output is 0,0,6. Hmm. So maybe the numbers are being rotated in some way. For example, in the first row of the input, the 6 is moved to the third column of the output's third row. The 1 and 2 in the input's third row are moved to the first and second positions of the output's first row. Wait, maybe the numbers are being arranged in a certain order. Like, the output's first row is 0 1 2, which is the numbers 1, 2, 6? No, the input's first row is 6, 0, 0. The output's first row is 0,1,2. But where do these numbers come from? The input's third row has 2,1,0. The output's first row is 0,1,2. So maybe the numbers are being sorted in some way, but that's not clear.\n\nLooking at the third example. Input is a 9x9 grid. The output is also 9x9. Let me check the input and output. For example, the third row of the input is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 3s and 5 are moved. The original input's third row has 3,3,5 in positions 1,2,3. The output's third row has 5 in position 3, 3 in position 4 and 5. So maybe the numbers are being shifted to the right by two positions? Or perhaps some kind of rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved in a certain pattern. For example, in the third example, the input's fourth row is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So the 1s are moved to the sixth and seventh columns. Hmm. Maybe the numbers are being shifted to the right by certain positions.\n\nLooking at the first example again, the input's fourth row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the 3, 2, 5 in the input's row are now in positions 4,5,6 of the output's row. Wait, the original positions were 2,3,4 (columns 2,3,4). In the output, they are in positions 4,5,6. So that's a shift of two positions to the right. But then, in the third row of the output, there's 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. The input's third row was all zeros. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being rotated in a certain way. For example, in the first example, the numbers in the input's fourth row are 3, 2, 5. The output's fourth row has 5, 2, 3. So the order is reversed. But that's not the case. The original order is 3, 2, 5. The output's fourth row has 5, 2, 3. So the first and third elements are swapped. So maybe the numbers are being rotated in a certain way.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the numbers are being moved in a way that depends on their position. For example, in the first example, the input's fourth row has 3 in column 2, 2 in column 3, 5 in column 4. The output's fourth row has 5 in column 4, 2 in column 5, 3 in column 6. So the numbers are shifted to the right by two positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved in a certain pattern based on their value. For example, the 3 and 2 in the input are moved to the right, but the 5 is moved as well. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at the second example again. The input is:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 2\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6\n\nSo in the output, the numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, 2 are arranged. The 6 is moved to the third column of the third row. The 1 is in the second column of the first row. The 2 is in the third column of the first row. The 5 is in the second column of the second row. The 2 in the third row is moved to the third column of the second row.\n\nThis seems like the numbers are being sorted in a certain way. For example, the output's first row is 0 1 2. The input's third row has 2, 1, 0. So maybe the numbers are being sorted in some order. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being rotated in a certain way. For example, the output's first row is 0 1 2. The input's third row is 2 1 0. So maybe the numbers are being reversed and then shifted. For example, the third row's numbers are 2,1,0. Reversed, it's 0,1,2. Then placed in the first row. But how does that fit with other rows?\n\nIn the second example, the output's second row is 0 5 2. The input's second row is 2 5 0. If we take the 5 and 2, maybe they are moved. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the numbers are being moved based on their position in the grid. For example, in the third example, the input's third row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 5 is moved to column 3, and the 3s are moved to columns 4 and 5. So maybe the numbers are being shifted to the right by two positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved in a way that depends on their value. For example, numbers in the input are being moved to the right by two positions, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotation of the input. For example, in the first example, the fourth row of the input has 3, 2, 5. The output's fourth row has 5, 2, 3. So the order is reversed. But that's just three numbers. Maybe the entire grid is rotated.\n\nBut that's not possible because the input and output sizes are the same. For example, the first example's input is 7x9. The output is also 7x9. So maybe the transformation is not a rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain numbers are moved to specific positions based on their value. For example, in the first example, the 3s and 2s are moved to certain positions. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the third example. The input's third row has 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 5 is moved to column 3, and the 3s are moved to columns 4 and 5. So maybe the 5 is moved to the left by two positions, and the 3s are moved to the right by two positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved in a way that depends on their position. For example, in the first example's fourth row, the 3 is in column 2, and in the output it's in column 6. That's a shift of 4 positions to the right. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved in a certain pattern based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 3 in the input's fourth row is moved to the output's fourth row, column 6. The 2 is moved to column 5. The 5 is moved to column 4. So the numbers are shifted to the right by two positions. Wait, original positions are 2,3,4. Output positions are 4,5,6. So that's a shift of +2 positions. But why?\n\nIn the third example's third row, the input has 3,3,5 in columns 1,2,3. The output has 5 in column 3, 3 in columns 4 and 5. So that's a shift of +2 positions for the 5 (from column 3 to 3? No. Wait, original input is column 3 (0-based?), and output is column 3. Hmm, that's not a shift. Maybe the 5 is moved to column 3, and the 3s are moved to columns 4 and 5. So maybe the 5 is moved to the same column, but the 3s are shifted right by two.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the examples and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nLooking at Example 2 again. The input is:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 2\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6\n\nSo the output's first row is 0 1 2. The input's third row is 2 1 0. So the numbers 2,1,0 are reversed and placed in the first row. The output's second row is 0 5 2. The input's second row is 2 5 0. So the 5 and 2 are moved. The third row of the output is 0 0 6, which is the input's first row's 6 moved to the end.\n\nSo perhaps the numbers are being sorted in some way. For example, the first row of the output is the reversed third row of the input. The second row is the second row of the input with the 0 moved to the front. The third row is the first row's 6 moved to the end.\n\nThis seems like a possible pattern. But how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotation of the input. For example, in the second example, the output's first row is the third row of the input reversed. The second row is the second row of the input with the 0 moved to the front. The third row is the first row's 6 moved to the end. But this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain numbers are moved to specific positions based on their value. For example, in the second example, the 6 is moved to the third column of the third row. The 1 and 2 are moved to the first row.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to all three examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the third example. The input's fourth row is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So the 1s are moved to positions 5 and 6. So maybe the numbers are being shifted to the right by five positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the right by two positions, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the numbers in the fourth row are shifted to the right by two positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved in a way that depends on their value. For example, numbers with higher values are moved to the right, lower values to the left. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a transformation where the numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 3 is in column 2 of the input's fourth row. In the output's fourth row, it's in column 6. So that's a shift of +4 positions. The 2 is in column 3, shifted to 5 (shift +2). The 5 is in column 4, shifted to 4 (no shift). This doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being rotated in a certain way. For example, the numbers in the input's fourth row are being rotated to the right by two positions. But that would make 3,2,5 \u2192 5,3,2. But the output's fourth row is 5,2,3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the output of example 1, the third row of the output is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. The input's third row was all zeros. So maybe that's not related. But the input's fifth row is 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain numbers are moved to specific positions based on their value. For example, in the first example, the 3 and 2 are moved to the right, and the 5 is moved to the left. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nAt this point, it's challenging to find a consistent pattern. Maybe I should look for a transformation that can explain all three examples.\n\nLooking at example 2 again. The output is a rearrangement of the input's numbers. The numbers in the output are the same as the input's numbers. For example, the input has 6, 2, 5, 2, 1. The output has 0,1,2,0,5,2,0,0,6. So the numbers 6, 2, 5, 2, 1 are present in the output. The zeros are added as well.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is generated by taking the input's numbers and rearranging them in a certain way. For example, in example 2, the output's first row is 0 1 2, which are the numbers from the input's third row (2,1,0) reversed. The second row is 0 5 2, which is the input's second row (2,5,0) with the 0 moved to the front. The third row is 0 0 6, which is the input's first row (6,0,0) with the 6 moved to the end.\n\nThis suggests that the output is a rearrangement of the input's rows, possibly in a certain order. For example, the third row of the input becomes the first row of the output, reversed. The second row of the input becomes the second row of the output, with the 0 moved to the front. The first row of the input becomes the third row of the output, with the 6 moved to the end.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the rows are being reordered and transformed in some way. For example, in example 2, the rows are being reordered as third, second, first. And then each row is transformed.\n\nBut how to apply this to the other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the input's fourth row is transformed into the output's fourth row. The input's third row is all zeros, and the output's third row has 3s and 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is more about the positions of the non-zero numbers. For example, in example 2, the non-zero numbers are 6, 2, 5, 2, 1. The output has them arranged in a certain way.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is a rotation of the input. For example, in example 2, the input is a 3x3 grid. The output is also 3x3. If we rotate the input 90 degrees clockwise, would that match the output? Let's see.\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0 \u2192 [6, 0, 0]\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0 \u2192 [2, 5, 0]\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0 \u2192 [2, 1, 0]\n\nRotating 90 degrees clockwise would result in:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 2 \u2192 [0,5,2]\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2 \u2192 [0,5,2]\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6 \u2192 [0,0,6]\n\nBut the output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 2\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6\n\nSo that's not matching. So rotation doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transpose of the input. But the transpose of example 2's input would be:\n\nRow 0: 6 2 2 \u2192 [6,2,2]\n\nRow 1: 0 5 1 \u2192 [0,5,1]\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nWhich is not matching the output.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation involves taking the numbers in certain positions and moving them to others. For example, in example 2, the 1 is moved to the first row's second column. The 2 is moved to first row's third column. The 5 is in the second row's second column. The 6 is moved to third row's third column.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the numbers in the input and arrange them in a certain order based on their value. For example, in example 2, the numbers are 6, 2, 5, 2, 1. The output's first row is 0 1 2, which are the numbers 1, 2, 2. But the input has two 2s. The output's second row is 0 5 2. The third row is 0 0 6. So the numbers are sorted in some way.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being sorted in the output, but that doesn't fit the first example. In example 1, the output has 3s and 5s in certain positions.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can explain all three examples. Let's think about the third example again.\n\nIn example 3, the input's third row is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 5 is in column 3, and the 3s are in columns 4 and 5. So the 5 is moved to the same column, and the 3s are shifted right by two positions. The input's fourth row is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So the 1s are moved to columns 5 and 6. This suggests that the numbers are being shifted to the right by two positions. But why?\n\nIn example 1, the fourth row has 3, 2, 5. The output's fourth row has 5, 2, 3. So the 3 is moved to column 6, 2 to column 5, 5 to column 4. This is a shift of two positions to the right. But the 5 is in the original position 4, and in the output it's in position 4. So that's not a shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being rotated in a certain way. For example, the 3, 2, 5 in the input's fourth row are rotated to the right by two positions. So 3, 2, 5 \u2192 5, 3, 2. But the output is 5, 2, 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the numbers are being moved based on their value. For example, higher numbers are moved to the right, lower numbers to the left. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the numbers in the input and replace them with their positions in a certain way. For example, in example 2, the output's first row is 0 1 2, which could be the positions of the numbers in the input's third row. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. However, I need to write a function that can handle these examples. Let's think of possible transformations that could fit.\n\nLooking at the third example, the output's third row has the 5 in column 3 and the 3s in columns 4 and 5. The input's third row has 3,3,5 in columns 1,2,3. So the 5 is moved to column 3, and the 3s are moved to columns 4 and 5. This suggests that the 5 is moved to the same column, and the 3s are shifted right by two positions. But why?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to shift all non-zero numbers to the right by two positions. But in example 1, the fourth row's 3,2,5 are shifted to the right by two positions, but the 5 is in the same column. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to shift all non-zero numbers to the right by two positions, but if they are at the end of the row, they stay. For example, in the third example's third row, the 5 is in column 3. Shifting right by two would put it in column 5, but in the output it's in column 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved in a way that depends on their row. For example, in the first example, the fourth row is transformed, but the third row is not. This is too vague.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and applying a certain transformation to each cell. For example, in example 2, the output's first row is 0 1 2. The input's third row is 2 1 0. So the numbers are reversed. The second row of the output is 0 5 2, which is the input's second row (2 5 0) with the 0 moved to the front. The third row is 0 0 6, which is the input's first row (6 0 0) with the 6 moved to the end.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation for each row is to reverse the row and then move the zeros to the end or something like that. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the input and for each row, reverse the non-zero elements and place them in certain positions. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess. Let's think of a possible transformation that could work for the examples.\n\nIn example 2, the output's first row is 0 1 2. This is the third row of the input (2 1 0) reversed. The second row of the output is 0 5 2, which is the second row of the input (2 5 0) with the 0 moved to the front. The third row of the output is 0 0 6, which is the first row of the input (6 0 0) with the 6 moved to the end.\n\nSo it seems like the rows are being reordered as third, second, first, and each row is transformed in a certain way. For example, the third row is reversed, the second row has the 0 moved to the front, and the first row has the 6 moved to the end.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation involves reordering the rows and then transforming each row. But how to apply this to other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the input's fourth row is transformed into the output's fourth row. The input's third row is all zeros. The output's third row has 3s and 3s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the input and for each row, if it contains certain values, move them to specific positions. But without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother idea: in example 2, the output's first row is the third row of the input reversed. The second row is the second row of the input with the 0 moved to the front. The third row is the first row of the input with the 6 moved to the end. So the rows are being reordered and transformed in a certain way. This could be a possible pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize this to other examples?\n\nFor example, in example 1, the fourth row of the input is transformed into the output's fourth row. The input's fourth row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the 3, 2, 5 are moved to the right by two positions. The 5 is in position 4, 2 in 5, 3 in 6. So the 3 and 2 are shifted to the right by two, and the 5 stays in place.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation for a row is to shift the non-zero elements to the right by two positions. But why?\n\nIn example 3, the third row of the input is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 5 is in column 3, and the 3s are in columns 4 and 5. This could be a shift of two positions to the right for the 3s and 5. But how?\n\nThis suggests that non-zero elements are shifted to the right by two positions, but if they are at the end of the row, they stay. So for example, in the third row of example 3, the 5 is at position 3. Shifting right by two would put it at position 5, but in the output it's at position 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. But perhaps the transformation is to shift all non-zero elements to the right by two positions, and fill the left with zeros. For example, in example 1's fourth row: 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0 \u2192 after shifting right by two, it would be 0 0 0 0 3 2 5 0 0, but the output is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero elements are reversed and shifted. For example, in the fourth row of example 1, the non-zero elements are 3, 2, 5. Reversed, they are 5, 2, 3. Then shifted right by two positions? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to rotate the non-zero elements in the row. For example, in example 1's fourth row, the non-zero elements are 3, 2, 5. Rotated to the right by two positions would give 5, 3, 2. But the output is 5, 2, 3. So that's not matching.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I need to make a hypothesis. Let's assume that the transformation involves shifting non-zero elements to the right by two positions, and filling the left with zeros. Let's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput row 0: 6 0 0 \u2192 non-zero elements are 6. Shift right by two positions: 0 0 6 \u2192 which matches the output's third row.\n\nInput row 1: 2 5 0 \u2192 non-zero elements are 2, 5. Shift right by two positions: 0 0 2 5 \u2192 but the row is 3 elements. So shifting right by two positions would mean moving 2 and 5 to the end. So the row becomes 0 5 2 \u2192 which matches the output's second row.\n\nInput row 2: 2 1 0 \u2192 non-zero elements are 2, 1. Shift right by two positions: 0 1 2 \u2192 which matches the output's first row.\n\nThis seems to fit example 2.\n\nExample 1's fourth row: input is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. Non-zero elements are 3, 2, 5. Shifting right by two positions would mean moving them to the right by two, but since the row is 9 elements, shifting right by two would mean that the non-zero elements are moved to the end. So the row would be 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 5. But the output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this hypothesis works for example 2 but not for example 1. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to shift non-zero elements to the right by two positions, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in example 1's fourth row, the 3, 2, 5 are shifted to the right by two positions, but the 5 is moved to the fifth column (original position 4 + 2 = 6?), but the output has 5 in column 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: in example 1, the fourth row of the input has 3, 2, 5. The output's fourth row has 5, 2, 3. This is the reversed order of the non-zero elements. So maybe the non-zero elements are reversed and then shifted to the right by two positions. For example, 3, 2, 5 \u2192 reversed is 5, 2, 3 \u2192 then shifted right by two positions would be 0 0 5 2 3 0 0 0 0. But the output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero elements are reversed and placed in the middle of the row. For example, in example 1's fourth row, the non-zero elements are 3, 2, 5 \u2192 reversed is 5, 2, 3. Placed in positions 4, 5, 6. Which matches the output's fourth row. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn example 3's third row, the input is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. Non-zero elements are 3, 3, 5. Reversed is 5, 3, 3. Placed in positions 3, 4, 5. Which matches the output's third row (0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0).\n\nIn example 2's first row, the non-zero elements are 6. Reversed is 6. Placed in the third position, which matches the output's third row.\n\nIn example 2's second row, the non-zero elements are 2, 5. Reversed is 5, 2. Placed in positions 2 and 3, which matches the output's second row (0 5 2).\n\nIn example 2's third row, the non-zero elements are 2, 1. Reversed is 1, 2. Placed in positions 1 and 2, which matches the output's first row (0 1 2).\n\nSo this seems to be a possible pattern: for each row, collect the non-zero elements, reverse them, and place them in the row starting from position 4 (for example, in example 1's fourth row, the reversed non-zero elements are placed starting at position 4). Wait, but how to determine where to start?\n\nIn example 1's fourth row, the reversed non-zero elements are placed starting at position 4. In example 3's third row, the reversed non-zero elements are placed starting at position 3. In example 2's rows, the reversed elements are placed starting at position 0 for the first row, position 0 for the second row, and position 0 for the third row. So this doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the reversed non-zero elements are placed in the middle of the row, but how?\n\nWait, in example 1's fourth row, the input has 3, 2, 5 in columns 2, 3, 4. The output has them in columns 4, 5, 6. So the reversed elements are placed starting at column 4, which is two positions to the right of their original positions.\n\nIn example 3's third row, the input has 3, 3, 5 in columns 1, 2, 3. The output has them in columns 3, 4, 5. So the reversed elements are placed starting at column 3, which is two positions to the right of their original positions.\n\nIn example 2's rows, the reversed elements are placed starting at column 0 for the first row (0 1 2), column 0 for the second row (0 5 2), and column 0 for the third row (0 0 6). So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 2, the rows are being reordered. For example, the third row of the input becomes the first row of the output, reversed. The second row becomes the second row of the output, reversed and shifted. The first row becomes the third row of the output, reversed and shifted.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is:\n\n1. Reverse the order of the rows.\n2. For each row, reverse the non-zero elements and place them in the row starting from position 4 (for example, in example 1's fourth row, the reversed non-zero elements are placed starting at position 4, which is the fifth column).\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to reverse the non-zero elements of each row and place them in the row starting from position 4, but this doesn't fit example 2.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to reverse the non-zero elements of each row and place them in the row starting from position 4, but for rows with fewer non-zero elements, it's placed at the beginning.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the non-zero elements are reversed and placed in the row starting from position 4 (for example, in example 1's fourth row), but this is not consistent with all examples. However, this seems to fit some examples.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nThe steps would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Collect the non-zero elements.\n- Reverse them.\n- Place them in the row starting from position 4, filling the rest with zeros.\n\nBut in example 2, this would not work. For example, the first row of example 2 is [6, 0, 0]. The non-zero elements are [6], reversed is [6]. Placed starting at position 4? But the row is only 3 elements. So this approach is not applicable.\n\nAnother idea: for each row, the non-zero elements are reversed and placed in the row, starting from the beginning, and the rest are filled with zeros. For example, in example 2's third row, the non-zero elements are [2, 1], reversed is [1, 2], placed at the beginning, so the row becomes [1, 2, 0]. But the output's first row is [0, 1, 2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero elements are reversed and placed in the row, but the zeros are moved to the end. For example, in example 2's third row, [2, 1, 0] \u2192 reversed non-zero elements are [1, 2], then zeros are moved to the end \u2192 [1, 2, 0]. But the output's first row is [0, 1, 2], which is different.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is more complex.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the non-zero elements are reversed and placed in the row, with zeros filling the rest. This works for example 2, but not for example 1. However, this is the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Extract non-zero elements.\n- Reverse them.\n- Create a new row with these reversed elements, followed by zeros to fill the row.\n\nBut this would not fit example 1's fourth row. Let's see:\n\nExample 1's fourth row input: [0, 0, 3, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Non-zero elements are [3, 2, 5]. Reversed is [5, 2, 3]. New row is [5, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. But the output's fourth row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 3, 0, 0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut if we shift the reversed elements to the right by two positions, it would fit. So perhaps the reversed elements are placed starting from position 4 (index 4) in the row.\n\nIn example 1's fourth row, the reversed elements are [5, 2, 3]. Placed starting at position 4 (index 4), the row would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 3, 0, 0], which matches the output.\n\nIn example 3's third row, the non-zero elements are [3, 3, 5]. Reversed is [5, 3, 3]. Placed starting at position 3 (index 3), the row becomes:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], which matches the output.\n\nIn example 2's third row, the non-zero elements are [2, 1]. Reversed is [1, 2]. Placed starting at position 0, the row becomes [1, 2, 0], but the output's first row is [0, 1, 2]. So this doesn't fit. However, in example 2, the rows are reordered. So perhaps the rows are being reversed in order, and then each row is processed.\n\nSo the transformation steps could be:\n\n1. Reverse the order of the rows.\n2. For each row, reverse the non-zero elements and place them starting at position 4 (index 4).\n\nBut in example 2, the rows are reversed in order, so the input's rows are [row0, row1, row2] \u2192 output rows are [row2, row1, row0]. Then, for each of these rows, reverse the non-zero elements and place them starting at position 4.\n\nBut for example 2's row2 (input row2 is [2, 1, 0]), reversed non-zero elements are [1, 2], placed starting at position 0 \u2192 [1, 2, 0]. But the output's first row is [0, 1, 2]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero elements are placed starting at position 0, and the zeros are moved to the end. For example, in example 2's row2, [2, 1, 0] \u2192 non-zero elements [2, 1], reversed [1, 2], placed at the start, and zeros at the end \u2192 [1, 2, 0]. But the output's first row is [0, 1, 2], which is different.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the non-zero elements are reversed and placed in the row starting at position 4, and the rest are filled with zeros. This fits example 1 and example 3, but not example 2. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Collect non-zero elements.\n- Reverse them.\n- Create a new row where these reversed elements are placed starting at position 4, and the rest are zeros.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFor example, for a row of length 9:\n\nnew_row = [0] * 9\nfor i in range(len(reversed_non_zero)):\n    new_row[4 + i] = reversed_non_zero[i]\nreturn new_row\n\nBut this would work for example 1's fourth row, where reversed_non_zero is [5, 2, 3], and placed at positions 4,5,6.\n\nFor example 3's third row, reversed_non_zero is [5, 3, 3], placed at positions 3,4,5.\n\nBut for example 2's rows, this would not work. However, perhaps the rows are being reordered in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows are being reordered, and then each row is processed as described.\n\nBut without more examples, this is speculative.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        non_zero = [x for x in row if x != 0]\n        reversed_non_zero = non_zero[::-1]\n        new_row = [0]*9\n        for i in range(len(reversed_non_zero)):\n            new_row[4 + i] = reversed_non_zero[i]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle the example 2 correctly. However, it fits examples 1 and 3.\n\nBut wait, example 2's input is 3x3 grid. The code above assumes that each row is 9 elements, which is not the case. Oh, right! The training examples have different grid sizes. For example, example 2 is 3x3, but the test input is 7x9. So the code must handle different row lengths.\n\nWait, the problem says that the output must be 7x9. So the input and output grids are always 7x9. Wait, no. The training examples have different grid sizes. Example 1 is 7x9, example 2 is 3x3, example 3 is 9x9. But the test input is 7x9. So the function must handle grids of any size, but the output must always be 7x9. Wait, no. The problem says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 7\u00d79 output grid.\" So regardless of the input size, the output is 7x9. But the training examples have inputs of different sizes. So the function must take any input grid (of any size) and output a 7x9 grid.\n\nBut this is conflicting. The training examples have inputs of different sizes, but the output is always 7x9. So the function must transform any input grid into a 7x9 grid.\n\nBut this is confusing. How to handle that? Perhaps the training examples are just examples, and the function must take any input grid (of any size) and transform it into a 7x9 grid. But this is not clear. However, the problem says that the test input is 7x9, and the output must be 7x9.\n\nBut the training examples have inputs of different sizes. For example, example 2 is 3x3. How to transform it into 7x9? This suggests that the transformation is not based on the input size, but on the pattern observed in the examples.\n\nThis is a contradiction. Perhaps the training examples are not all of the same size, but the function is supposed to transform any input into a 7x9 output. But how?\n\nThis is confusing. However, the problem says that the test input is 7x9, and the output must be 7x9. So the function must take any input grid (of any size) and output a 7x9 grid. But how to determine the transformation?\n\nThis suggests that the function is supposed to transform the input into a 7x9 grid, but the training examples have inputs of different sizes. So the function must handle that.\n\nBut this makes it more complex. However, given that the training examples are provided, perhaps the transformation is based on the patterns observed in the examples, and the output is always 7x9.\n\nBut this is not clear. However, the problem says that the function must return a 7x9 grid, so the code must produce that.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation for each row is to reverse the non-zero elements and place them starting at position 4, and the rest are zeros. This would fit example 1 and 3, and perhaps the test input.\n\nFor example, the test input is 7x9. Let's look at the input:\n\nRow 5: 8 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 \u2192 non-zero elements are 8,5. Reversed is 5,8. Placed starting at position 4 (index 4), so the new row would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0]. But the output is not known, but the code would generate this.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        non_zero = [x for x in row if x != 0]\n        reversed_non_zero = non_zero[::-1]\n        new_row = [0]*9\n        for i in range(len(reversed_non_zero)):\n            new_row[4 + i] = reversed_non_zero[i]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this code would not handle example 2 correctly, but it fits examples 1 and 3.\n\nHowever, the problem says that the output must be 7x9, so the code must generate a 7x9 grid, which it does.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis based on the examples. I'm not sure if this is the correct pattern, but given the time, I'll proceed with this.\n"
