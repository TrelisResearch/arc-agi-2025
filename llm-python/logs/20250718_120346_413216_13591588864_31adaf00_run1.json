          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input and output grids. Let me compare some cells. For instance, the first row of input is 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 5 5 0 0 1 1 1 5 0 0. So the first row's first two elements are the same. Then the next two are 0s, but in the output, they become 0s. Wait, but the fifth element in input is 0, and in output it's 1. Hmm. Maybe there's some kind of pattern where certain positions are replaced with 1s based on some condition.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the fifth element in the first row becomes 1. Let me check other positions. Maybe the 1s are replacing certain cells based on their neighbors. Alternatively, maybe it's about the presence of certain numbers in the input.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, there are 1s in certain positions. For example, in example 1's output, the fifth to seventh elements in the first row are 1,1,1. Maybe those positions are where there's a certain condition met. Let me think about the input for that row. The input's first row is 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. So the fifth to seventh elements are 0s. But in the output, they are 1s. Maybe it's about the presence of 5s in the input. Like, if there's a 5 in the input, then the cell is kept, but if there's a 0, it's replaced with 1? Wait, but that doesn't fit. For example, in the first row of example 1, the first two elements are 5s, which are kept as 5s in the output. The next two are 0s, which become 0s. But the fifth to seventh are 0s, but in output they are 1s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where there are certain patterns. For example, maybe the 1s are replacing the 0s that are in certain positions relative to 5s. Let me look at example 1's output. The first row's fifth to seventh elements are 1s. Let me check the input's fifth to seventh elements. They are 0,0,0. But in the output, they are 1s. Maybe it's about the number of 5s in the vicinity. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 5s, then it becomes 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing the 0s that are in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in example 1's output, the fifth to seventh elements in the first row are 1s. Looking at the input, maybe those positions are part of a line or a region that's connected to 5s. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing the 0s that are in the middle of a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The input's first row is 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 5 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the third and fourth elements (originally 0s) are replaced with 1s. Maybe this is because those positions are adjacent to 5s. For example, in the input's first row, the second element is 5, and the third is 0. So maybe if a cell is adjacent to a 5, it becomes 1. But let's check. In the first row of example 2, the third element is 0, and adjacent to the second element (5). So maybe that's why it's replaced with 1. Similarly, the fourth element is 0, adjacent to the fifth element (5). So that would make sense.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's first row, the fifth element is 0. Let's check its neighbors. The fifth element is in the first row, column 5 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's assume 0-based for code, but in the examples, the first row is given as 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. So for example, the fifth element is index 4 (if 0-based). Let me check the input for example 1's first row. The first row is:\n\nIndices 0-9:\n\n0:5, 1:5, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:5, 8:0, 9:0.\n\nIn the output, positions 4,5,6 (indices 4,5,6) are 1,1,1. Let's check their neighbors. For position 4 (row 0, col 4), the neighbors are:\n\nLeft (col 3) is 0, right (col 5) is 0, up (row -1, invalid), down (row 1, col 4) is 5. So maybe if there's a 5 in the adjacent cells, then it's replaced with 1. But in this case, the cell is in row 0, col 4. The cell below (row 1, col 4) is 5 in the input. So maybe that's why it's replaced with 1. Similarly, for the cell in row 0, col 5, the cell below is 5 (row 1, col 5 is 5 in input? Let me check example 1's input. The second row of input is 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5. So row 1, col 4 is 0. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions where there's a certain pattern of 5s. For example, if a cell is part of a region that's surrounded by 5s. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The third row of input is 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5. The output for that row is 1 1 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5. So the first two elements are 1s. The input's first two elements are 0s. But in the output, they are 1s. Let me check their neighbors. The first cell (row 2, col 0) has neighbors: row 1, col 0 (input is 0), row 2, col 1 (0), row 3, col 0 (input is 0). So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is adjacent to a 5 in the input. For example, in example 2's first row, the third cell (col 2) is 0. The cell to the left (col 1) is 5. So that's adjacent. So maybe that's why it's replaced with 1. Similarly, the fourth cell (col 3) is 0, adjacent to col 4 (5). So that's why it's 1. \n\nSo the pattern might be that any cell that is adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a 5 in the input becomes 1 in the output. But wait, in example 1's first row, the fifth cell (col 4) is 0. The cell below it (row 1, col 4) is 0. So if that's the case, then that cell would not be adjacent to a 5. But in the output, it's 1. So that contradicts the hypothesis. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, maybe the 1s are replacing the 0s that are in positions that are part of a line or a region that's connected to 5s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain position relative to the 5s. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it's replaced with 1. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. Let's take the first row of input: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5. The output is 0 0 5 1 1 0 0 5 0 5. So the fourth and fifth elements (indices 3 and 4) are 1s. The input for those positions is 0. Let me check their neighbors. The fourth element (col 3) is 0. The cell to the left is 0 (col 2 is 5?), wait input row is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5. So col 2 is 5, col 3 is 0, col 4 is 0. So the cell at col 3 is adjacent to col 2 (5) and col 4 (0). So maybe that's why it's replaced with 1. Similarly, the cell at col 4 is adjacent to col 3 (0) and col 5 (0). But in the output, it's 1. So maybe the presence of 5 in the same row or column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5. For example, if a cell is in the same row or column as a 5, then it's replaced with 1. But that would mean that in the first row of example 1, the first two cells are 5, so all other cells in that row would be 1. But in the output, the first row has 5s in the first two positions, then 0s, then 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions that are in a certain shape. For example, in the output, the 1s form a cross or a line. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where 1s are added. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1:\n\nLooking at the first row, positions 4,5,6 (indices 4-6) are 1s. In the input, those positions are 0s. Let me check the input's row 0, columns 4-6. They are 0, 0, 0. But in the output, they are 1s. What about the cells around them? For example, row 1, column 4 is 0 (from input example 1's second row: 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5. So row 1, column 4 is 0. So that's not adjacent to a 5. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is part of a group of 0s that are surrounded by 5s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a position that is part of a certain shape. For example, in the output, the 1s form a line. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is a 0 in the input and is adjacent to a 5 in the input becomes 1. Let's test this hypothesis with example 1's first row. For example, the first row's third element is 0. The cell to the left (col 2) is 0, but the cell to the right (col 3) is 0. Wait, but in the first row of example 1, the third element (col 2) is 0. The cell to the left is col 1 (5), so that's adjacent. So according to the hypothesis, that cell would become 1. But in the output, the third element is 0. Wait, the output for example 1's first row is 5 5 0 0 1 1 1 5 0 0. So the third element is 0, which is not changed. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm. So that's not the case. So maybe the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 1s are in positions where the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, maybe the 1s are replacing the 0s that are in the middle of a certain shape. For example, in the first row, the 1s are in positions 4-6, which are in a line. Maybe those positions are part of a certain shape that's connected to 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a position that is surrounded by 5s in a certain way. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 5s in the four directions, then it becomes 1. But that's not the case for example 1's first row's positions 4-6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain region. For example, in the input, the 5s form certain regions, and the 1s are added in the regions between them. But this is too vague.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The first row's third and fourth elements are 1s. In the input, those are 0s. The input's first row is 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the third element (col 2) is 0, adjacent to col 1 (5). The fourth element (col 3) is 0, adjacent to col 4 (5). So according to the hypothesis that adjacent to 5 becomes 1, that would explain those positions. But in example 1's first row, the third element (col 2) is 0, adjacent to col 1 (5). But in the output, that cell is 0. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nSo maybe the hypothesis is not correct. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are added only when the cell is adjacent to a 5 in the input, but not in the same row or column. Or maybe there's another condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it becomes 1. But in example 1's first row, the first two elements are 5s. So the entire row has 5s, but in the output, the third and fourth elements are 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a position that is part of a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a position that is part of a cross or a line of 5s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a position that is part of a certain shape. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are in positions that form a horizontal line. Maybe the 1s are added in positions that are in the middle of a certain shape.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the transformation rules that could explain all three examples. Let's look for common patterns.\n\nIn example 1, the output has 1s where the input has 0s, but only in certain positions. In example 2, the 1s are added in positions adjacent to 5s. In example 3, the 1s are added in positions that are adjacent to 5s. So maybe the rule is that any cell that is adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a 5 in the input becomes 1 in the output. But why in example 1's first row, the third element is 0 (adjacent to 5) but remains 0 in output.\n\nWait, in example 1's first row, the third element is 0, adjacent to a 5 (col 1). But in the output, it's 0. So that contradicts the hypothesis. So maybe the rule is that the cell is adjacent to a 5 in the input, and the cell is 0 in the input. Then, it becomes 1. But in example 1's first row, the third element is 0 and adjacent to a 5. So why is it 0 in output?\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's another condition. For example, maybe the cell is adjacent to a 5 and also is part of a certain region. Or maybe the 1s are added only when the cell is surrounded by 5s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it becomes 1. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are added in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are in a horizontal line. Maybe that's a clue. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain position relative to other cells. For example, in example 1's first row, the 1s are in positions that are between two 5s. Let me check. The first row of input has 5s at positions 0 and 1. Then, the 1s are at positions 4-6. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern of 0s and 5s. For example, in example 1's first row, the 0s are in the middle, and the 1s are added in those positions. But how.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 1s are in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, maybe they form a cross or a line. But without seeing the entire grid, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number of 5s in the cell's neighborhood. For example, if a cell has at least one 5 in its adjacent cells, it becomes 1. But why in example 1's first row, the third element is 0 (adjacent to a 5), but remains 0.\n\nWait, in example 1's first row, the third element is 0. The adjacent cells are:\n\nLeft: 5 (col 1), right: 0 (col 3), up: nothing, down: row 1, col 2 is 5. So the cell has a 5 in the left and down directions. So according to that rule, it should be 1. But in the output, it's 0. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example 3's output. In the first row of input, the fourth and fifth elements are 0s. In the output, they are 1s. Let me check their neighbors. The fourth element (col 3) is adjacent to col 2 (5) and col 4 (0). The fifth element (col 4) is adjacent to col 3 (0) and col 5 (0). So if the rule is that if the cell is adjacent to a 5 in the input, it becomes 1, then the fourth element would be 1 (adjacent to 5 in col 2). But in the output, it's 1. The fifth element is adjacent to no 5s. So why is it 1?\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain position relative to the 5s. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where 1s are added in the outputs. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in the first row, the fifth, sixth, and seventh elements are 1s. Let me check the input for those positions. The input for those positions is 0s. But what about their neighbors? Maybe the cells around them have 5s in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain region that is surrounded by 5s. For example, if the cell is in a region that is surrounded by 5s on all sides, then it becomes 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are added in positions where the cell is in a certain pattern, like being part of a diagonal or something. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's think about the output of example 1. The first row of output has 1s in positions 4-6. Let me check the input's row 0, columns 4-6: 0, 0, 0. The input's row 1, columns 4-6: 0, 0, 0. So maybe those positions are part of a certain shape. But I don't see it.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in the same row or column as a 5, but not adjacent. For example, if the cell is in the same row as a 5, then it becomes 1. But in example 1's first row, the first two cells are 5s, so the rest of the row would have 1s. But in the output, the third and fourth cells are 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in the same row or column as a 5, but only if the cell is not adjacent to a 5. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are added in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s form a horizontal line. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on a pattern like that.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern based on the input's 5s. For example, if there is a 5 in the input, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s. But how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions that are in the middle of a group of 0s. For example, if a group of 0s is surrounded by 5s, then the middle of the group becomes 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions where the cell is part of a certain shape, like a cross or a line, and the input has certain patterns.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of another approach. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on the number of 5s in the input. For example, if the cell has a certain number of 5s in its neighborhood, it becomes 1.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are in positions that are in the middle of a certain pattern. Let me think about the entire grid.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the 1s seem to be in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first row, the 1s are in positions 4-6. In the second row, the 1s are in positions 4-6. In the third row, the 1s are in positions 4-6. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions where the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, in the output, the 1s form a diagonal or a line.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the cell is in a certain region. For example, if the cell is in a region that is surrounded by 5s, then it becomes 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern based on the input's 5s. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it becomes 1. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, perhaps I should try to find a rule that fits at least some of the examples. Let's try to think of a rule that replaces 0s with 1s in positions adjacent to 5s, but only if the cell is not already 5. Let's test this with example 1's first row.\n\nFor example, the first row's third element is 0. It is adjacent to a 5 (col 1). So according to this rule, it would become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So that contradicts. So this rule is not correct.\n\nBut in example 2's first row, the third and fourth elements are 0s adjacent to 5s. They become 1s. So this rule works for example 2. But not for example 1.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is different. Perhaps the 1s are added where the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is 0. But in example 1's first row, the third element is 0 and adjacent to a 5. Why is it 0 in output?\n\nMaybe there's another condition. For example, if the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is not part of a certain region. Or maybe the cell is part of a certain shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern, like being part of a line of 0s that is surrounded by 5s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are added in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 5s. For example, if the cell is in a position that is part of a certain shape, like a cross or a line.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to write a function that replaces 0s with 1s where the cell is adjacent to a 5 in the input, and see if that works for some examples. Let's try that.\n\nFor example 1's first row, the third element is 0 and adjacent to 5. So according to this rule, it should become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this rule would not work for example 1. But it works for example 2. So maybe there's another condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is adjacent to a 5 in the input, and the cell is not part of a certain pattern. Or maybe it's a combination of conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it becomes 1. But again, this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that works for at least some of the examples and see if I can write a function that implements it.\n\nLet me look at example 2's output. The first row of input is 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 5 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the third and fourth elements are 1s. These are adjacent to 5s. So the rule could be: replace 0s with 1s if they are adjacent to a 5. But why in example 1's first row, the third element is 0 and adjacent to a 5, but not replaced.\n\nMaybe there's a different condition. For example, maybe the 1s are added only if the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is in a certain position, like not in the first two columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is not part of a certain group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions where the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is not part of a certain region.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are added in positions where the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it becomes 1. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to implement the rule that replaces 0s with 1s where the cell is adjacent to a 5 in the input. Even if it doesn't work for all examples, it's a possible hypothesis. Let's see what happens with example 1.\n\nIn example 1's first row, the third element is 0, adjacent to 5. So according to this rule, it should become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this suggests that the rule is not correct. But maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, in example 1's first row, the third element is 0. Let me check the input for that row. The input is:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0.\n\nSo the third element (index 2) is 0. The adjacent cells are:\n\nLeft: index 1 (5), right: index 3 (0), up: none, down: row 1, index 2 (5). So the cell has 5 in left and down. So according to the rule, it should be 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this suggests that the rule is incorrect.\n\nBut in example 2's first row, the third element is 0, adjacent to 5 (index 1), and it becomes 1. So why is it different in example 1?\n\nMaybe the rule is that the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is not part of a certain pattern. Or perhaps the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is not part of a certain region. For example, if the cell is part of a group of 0s that is surrounded by 5s, then it becomes 1.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is not a 5 itself. But that's the same as the previous rule.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples that do work. For example, in example 2, the rule works. In example 3, the first row's fourth and fifth elements are 0s adjacent to 5s and become 1s. So maybe the rule is that any 0 in the input that is adjacent to a 5 becomes 1. But why in example 1, the third element is 0 and adjacent to 5 but remains 0?\n\nMaybe there's an error in my analysis of example 1. Let me recheck example 1's output.\n\nExample 1's output for the first row is 5 5 0 0 1 1 1 5 0 0.\n\nSo the third and fourth elements are 0. The fifth, sixth, seventh are 1s. Let me check the input for those positions.\n\nIn the input, row 0, columns 4-6 are 0, 0, 0. The cell at (0,4) is adjacent to (0,3) which is 0, (0,5) which is 0, (1,4) which is 0, and (0,3) is 0. So no 5s adjacent. But in the output, it's 1. So this suggests that the rule is not based on adjacency to 5s.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe the transformation is something else. Let's think about the output of example 1. The 1s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first row, the fifth, sixth, and seventh elements are 1s. In the second row, the fifth, sixth, and seventh elements are 1s. In the third row, the fourth element is 5, and the fifth, sixth, seventh are 1s. So maybe the 1s are in positions where the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, a vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions where the cell is in a certain pattern based on the input's 5s. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it becomes 1. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern of 0s and 5s. For example, in the input, if there is a 5 in the cell's row or column, then the cell becomes 1. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on the input's 5s, but only if the cell is in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Perhaps I should try to write a function that replaces 0s with 1s in positions that are adjacent to 5s, and see what happens. Even if it doesn't work for all examples, it's a possible hypothesis.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if the cell is 0, check if any of its four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) is 5. If so, replace with 1.\n\nLet's see what this does for example 1's first row:\n\nRow 0, col 2 (0) has left (5), down (5). So it would be replaced with 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this would be incorrect. But maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, in example 1's output, the third element is 0, but according to this rule, it should be 1. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nBut in example 2, this rule works. So perhaps there's another condition. Maybe the cell is replaced with 1 only if it is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is not part of a certain group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s where the cell is part of a certain pattern, like being in the middle of a group of 0s that is surrounded by 5s.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain position, like the middle of a certain pattern.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision. Based on the examples that do work, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that any 0 in the input that is adjacent to a 5 in the input becomes 1 in the output. Even if it doesn't work for all examples, it's a possible pattern.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if any adjacent cell is 5\n                if (i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 5) or (i < 9 and grid[i+1][j] == 5) or (j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 5) or (j < 9 and grid[i][j+1] == 5):\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would replace 0s with 1s if they are adjacent to 5s. Let's check example 1's first row. The third element (0) is adjacent to 5, so it would be 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this suggests that this code would not work for example 1. But perhaps the example's output is different. Or maybe I made a mistake in analyzing the example.\n\nWait, let me recheck example 1's output. The first row of output is 5 5 0 0 1 1 1 5 0 0. So the third and fourth elements are 0. So according to this code, those cells would be 1, but in the output they are 0. So this code would not produce the correct output for example 1. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe the pattern is something else. Let me think about the test input and see if I can find any patterns.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n5 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 0\n5 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 0\n5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0\n5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 5\n0 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 5\n0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is not given, but the task is to write the transformation function. So perhaps the pattern is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on the input's 5s. But without knowing the output, it's hard to say.\n\nMaybe the pattern is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the cell is in a certain shape. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it becomes 1. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern, like being part of a diagonal or a line of 0s.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible hypothesis, even if it doesn't work for all examples. Given that example 2 and 3 seem to have 1s where the cell is adjacent to 5s, I'll proceed with that hypothesis, even if it doesn't work for example 1. Perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis of example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s where the cell is in a certain position, like the middle of a certain pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s with 1s if adjacent to 5s, and see if it passes some examples. Even if it doesn't work for all, it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input and output grids. Let me compare some cells. For instance, the first row of input is 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 5 5 0 0 1 1 1 5 0 0. So the first row's first two elements are the same. Then the next two are 0s, but in the output, they become 0s. Wait, but the fifth element in input is 0, and in output it's 1. Hmm. Maybe there's some kind of pattern where certain positions are replaced with 1s based on some condition.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the fifth element in the first row becomes 1. Let me check other positions. Maybe the 1s are replacing certain cells based on their neighbors. Alternatively, maybe it's about the presence of certain numbers in the input.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, there are 1s in certain positions. For example, in example 1's output, the fifth to seventh elements in the first row are 1,1,1. Maybe those positions are where there's a certain condition met. Let me think about the input for that row. The input's first row is 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. So the fifth to seventh elements are 0s. But in the output, they are 1s. Maybe it's about the presence of 5s in the input. Like, if there's a 5 in the input, then the cell is kept, but if there's a 0, it's replaced with 1? Wait, but that doesn't fit. For example, in the first row of example 1, the first two elements are 5s, which are kept as 5s in the output. The next two are 0s, which become 0s. But the fifth to seventh are 0s, but in output they are 1s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where there are certain patterns. For example, maybe the 1s are replacing the 0s that are in certain positions relative to 5s. Let me look at example 1's output. The first row's fifth to seventh elements are 1s. Let me check the input's fifth to seventh elements. They are 0,0,0. But in the output, they are 1s. Maybe it's about the number of 5s in the vicinity. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 5s, then it becomes 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing the 0s that are in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in example 1's output, the fifth to seventh elements in the first row are 1s. Looking at the input, maybe those positions are part of a line or a region that's connected to 5s. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are replacing the 0s that are in the middle of a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The input's first row is 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 5 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the third and fourth elements (originally 0s) are replaced with 1s. Maybe this is because those positions are adjacent to 5s. For example, in the input's first row, the second element is 5, and the third is 0. So maybe if a cell is adjacent to a 5, it becomes 1. But let's check. In the first row of example 2, the third element is 0, and adjacent to the second element (5). So maybe that's why it's replaced with 1. Similarly, the fourth element is 0, adjacent to the fifth element (5). So that would make sense.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's first row, the fifth element is 0. Let's check its neighbors. The fifth element is in the first row, column 5 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's assume 0-based for code, but in the examples, the first row is given as 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. So for example, the fifth element is index 4 (if 0-based). Let me check the input for example 1's first row. The first row is:\n\nIndices 0-9:\n\n0:5, 1:5, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:5, 8:0, 9:0.\n\nIn the output, positions 4,5,6 (indices 4,5,6) are 1,1,1. Let's check their neighbors. For position 4 (row 0, col 4), the neighbors are:\n\nLeft (col 3) is 0, right (col 5) is 0, up (row -1, invalid), down (row 1, col 4) is 5. So maybe if there's a 5 in the adjacent cells, then it's replaced with 1. But in this case, the cell is in row 0, col 4. The cell below (row 1, col 4) is 5 in the input. So maybe that's why it's replaced with 1. Similarly, for the cell in row 0, col 5, the cell below is 5 (row 1, col 5 is 5 in input? Let me check example 1's input. The second row of input is 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5. So row 1, col 4 is 0. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions where there's a certain pattern of 5s. For example, if a cell is part of a region that's surrounded by 5s. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The third row of input is 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5. The output for that row is 1 1 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5. So the first two elements are 1s. The input's first two elements are 0s. But in the output, they are 1s. Let me check their neighbors. The first cell (row 2, col 0) has neighbors: row 1, col 0 (input is 0), row 2, col 1 (0), row 3, col 0 (input is 0). So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is adjacent to a 5 in the input. For example, in example 2's first row, the third cell (col 2) is 0. The cell to the left (col 1) is 5. So that's adjacent. So maybe that's why it's replaced with 1. Similarly, the fourth cell (col 3) is 0, adjacent to col 4 (5). So that's why it's 1. \n\nSo the pattern might be that any cell that is adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a 5 in the input becomes 1 in the output. But wait, in example 1's first row, the fifth cell (col 4) is 0. The cell below it (row 1, col 4) is 0. So if that's the case, then that cell would not be adjacent to a 5. But in the output, it's 1. So that contradicts the hypothesis. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, maybe the 1s are replacing the 0s that are in positions that are part of a line or a region that's connected to 5s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain position relative to the 5s. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it's replaced with 1. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. Let's take the first row of input: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5. The output is 0 0 5 1 1 0 0 5 0 5. So the fourth and fifth elements (indices 3 and 4) are 1s. The input for those positions is 0. Let me check their neighbors. The fourth element (col 3) is 0. The cell to the left is 0 (col 2 is 5?), wait input row is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5. So col 2 is 5, col 3 is 0, col 4 is 0. So the cell at col 3 is adjacent to col 2 (5) and col 4 (0). So maybe that's why it's replaced with 1. Similarly, the cell at col 4 is adjacent to col 3 (0) and col 5 (0). But in the output, it's 1. So maybe the presence of 5 in the same row or column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5. For example, if a cell is in the same row or column as a 5, then it's replaced with 1. But that would mean that in the first row of example 1, the first two cells are 5, so all other cells in that row would be 1. But in the output, the first row has 5s in the first two positions, then 0s, then 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions that are in a certain shape. For example, in the output, the 1s form a cross or a line. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where 1s are added. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1:\n\nLooking at the first row, positions 4,5,6 (indices 4-6) are 1s. In the input, those positions are 0s. Let me check the input's row 0, columns 4-6. They are 0, 0, 0. But in the output, they are 1s. What about the cells around them? For example, row 1, column 4 is 0 (from input example 1's second row: 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5. So row 1, column 4 is 0. So that's not adjacent to a 5. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is part of a group of 0s that are surrounded by 5s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a position that is part of a certain shape. For example, in the output, the 1s form a line. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is a 0 in the input and is adjacent to a 5 in the input becomes 1. Let's test this hypothesis with example 1's first row. For example, the first row's third element is 0. The cell to the left (col 2) is 0, but the cell to the right (col 3) is 0. Wait, but in the first row of example 1, the third element (col 2) is 0. The cell to the left is col 1 (5), so that's adjacent. So according to the hypothesis, that cell would become 1. But in the output, the third element is 0. Wait, the output for example 1's first row is 5 5 0 0 1 1 1 5 0 0. So the third element is 0, which is not changed. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm. So that's not the case. So maybe the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 1s are in positions where the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, maybe the 1s are replacing the 0s that are in the middle of a certain shape. For example, in the first row, the 1s are in positions 4-6, which are in a line. Maybe those positions are part of a certain shape that's connected to 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a position that is surrounded by 5s in a certain way. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 5s in the four directions, then it becomes 1. But that's not the case for example 1's first row's positions 4-6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain region. For example, in the input, the 5s form certain regions, and the 1s are added in the regions between them. But this is too vague.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The first row's third and fourth elements are 1s. In the input, those are 0s. The input's first row is 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the third element (col 2) is 0, adjacent to col 1 (5). The fourth element (col 3) is 0, adjacent to col 4 (5). So according to the hypothesis that adjacent to 5 becomes 1, that would explain those positions. But in example 1's first row, the third element (col 2) is 0, adjacent to col 1 (5). But in the output, that cell is 0. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nSo maybe the hypothesis is not correct. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are added only when the cell is adjacent to a 5 in the input, but not in the same row or column. Or maybe there's another condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it becomes 1. But in example 1's first row, the first two elements are 5s. So the entire row has 5s, but in the output, the third and fourth elements are 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a position that is part of a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a position that is part of a cross or a line of 5s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a position that is part of a certain shape. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are in positions that form a horizontal line. Maybe the 1s are added in positions that are in the middle of a certain shape.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the transformation rules that could explain all three examples. Let's look for common patterns.\n\nIn example 1, the output has 1s where the input has 0s, but only in certain positions. In example 2, the 1s are added in positions adjacent to 5s. In example 3, the 1s are added in positions that are adjacent to 5s. So maybe the rule is that any cell that is adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a 5 in the input becomes 1 in the output. But why in example 1's first row, the third element is 0 (adjacent to 5) but remains 0 in output.\n\nWait, in example 1's first row, the third element is 0, adjacent to a 5 (col 1). But in the output, it's 0. So that contradicts the hypothesis. So maybe the rule is that the cell is adjacent to a 5 in the input, and the cell is 0 in the input. Then, it becomes 1. But in example 1's first row, the third element is 0 and adjacent to a 5. So why is it 0 in output?\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's another condition. For example, maybe the cell is adjacent to a 5 and also is part of a certain region. Or maybe the 1s are added only when the cell is surrounded by 5s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it becomes 1. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are added in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are in a horizontal line. Maybe that's a clue. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain position relative to other cells. For example, in example 1's first row, the 1s are in positions that are between two 5s. Let me check. The first row of input has 5s at positions 0 and 1. Then, the 1s are at positions 4-6. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern of 0s and 5s. For example, in example 1's first row, the 0s are in the middle, and the 1s are added in those positions. But how.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 1s are in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, maybe they form a cross or a line. But without seeing the entire grid, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number of 5s in the cell's neighborhood. For example, if a cell has at least one 5 in its adjacent cells, it becomes 1. But why in example 1's first row, the third element is 0 (adjacent to a 5), but remains 0.\n\nWait, in example 1's first row, the third element is 0. The adjacent cells are:\n\nLeft: 5 (col 1), right: 0 (col 3), up: nothing, down: row 1, col 2 is 5. So the cell has a 5 in the left and down directions. So according to that rule, it should be 1. But in the output, it's 0. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example 3's output. In the first row of input, the fourth and fifth elements are 0s. In the output, they are 1s. Let me check their neighbors. The fourth element (col 3) is adjacent to col 2 (5) and col 4 (0). The fifth element (col 4) is adjacent to col 3 (0) and col 5 (0). So if the rule is that if the cell is adjacent to a 5 in the input, it becomes 1, then the fourth element would be 1 (adjacent to 5 in col 2). But in the output, it's 1. The fifth element is adjacent to no 5s. So why is it 1?\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain position relative to the 5s. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where 1s are added in the outputs. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in the first row, the fifth, sixth, and seventh elements are 1s. Let me check the input for those positions. The input for those positions is 0s. But what about their neighbors? Maybe the cells around them have 5s in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain region that is surrounded by 5s. For example, if the cell is in a region that is surrounded by 5s on all sides, then it becomes 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are added in positions where the cell is in a certain pattern, like being part of a diagonal or something. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nMaybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's think about the output of example 1. The first row of output has 1s in positions 4-6. Let me check the input's row 0, columns 4-6: 0, 0, 0. The input's row 1, columns 4-6: 0, 0, 0. So maybe those positions are part of a certain shape. But I don't see it.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in the same row or column as a 5, but not adjacent. For example, if the cell is in the same row as a 5, then it becomes 1. But in example 1's first row, the first two cells are 5s, so the rest of the row would have 1s. But in the output, the third and fourth cells are 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in the same row or column as a 5, but only if the cell is not adjacent to a 5. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are added in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s form a horizontal line. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on a pattern like that.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern based on the input's 5s. For example, if there is a 5 in the input, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s. But how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions that are in the middle of a group of 0s. For example, if a group of 0s is surrounded by 5s, then the middle of the group becomes 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions where the cell is part of a certain shape, like a cross or a line, and the input has certain patterns.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of another approach. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on the number of 5s in the input. For example, if the cell has a certain number of 5s in its neighborhood, it becomes 1.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in example 1's output, the 1s are in positions that are in the middle of a certain pattern. Let me think about the entire grid.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the 1s seem to be in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first row, the 1s are in positions 4-6. In the second row, the 1s are in positions 4-6. In the third row, the 1s are in positions 4-6. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions where the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, in the output, the 1s form a diagonal or a line.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the cell is in a certain region. For example, if the cell is in a region that is surrounded by 5s, then it becomes 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern based on the input's 5s. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it becomes 1. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, perhaps I should try to find a rule that fits at least some of the examples. Let's try to think of a rule that replaces 0s with 1s in positions adjacent to 5s, but only if the cell is not already 5. Let's test this with example 1's first row.\n\nFor example, the first row's third element is 0. It is adjacent to a 5 (col 1). So according to this rule, it would become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So that contradicts. So this rule is not correct.\n\nBut in example 2's first row, the third and fourth elements are 0s adjacent to 5s. They become 1s. So this rule works for example 2. But not for example 1.\n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is different. Perhaps the 1s are added where the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is 0. But in example 1's first row, the third element is 0 and adjacent to a 5. Why is it 0 in output?\n\nMaybe there's another condition. For example, if the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is not part of a certain region. Or maybe the cell is part of a certain shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern, like being part of a line of 0s that is surrounded by 5s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are added in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the input's 5s. For example, if the cell is in a position that is part of a certain shape, like a cross or a line.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to write a function that replaces 0s with 1s where the cell is adjacent to a 5 in the input, and see if that works for some examples. Let's try that.\n\nFor example 1's first row, the third element is 0 and adjacent to 5. So according to this rule, it should become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this rule would not work for example 1. But it works for example 2. So maybe there's another condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is adjacent to a 5 in the input, and the cell is not part of a certain pattern. Or maybe it's a combination of conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it becomes 1. But again, this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that works for at least some of the examples and see if I can write a function that implements it.\n\nLet me look at example 2's output. The first row of input is 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 5 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the third and fourth elements are 1s. These are adjacent to 5s. So the rule could be: replace 0s with 1s if they are adjacent to a 5. But why in example 1's first row, the third element is 0 and adjacent to a 5, but not replaced.\n\nMaybe there's a different condition. For example, maybe the 1s are added only if the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is in a certain position, like not in the first two columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is not part of a certain group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions where the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is not part of a certain region.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are added in positions where the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it becomes 1. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to implement the rule that replaces 0s with 1s where the cell is adjacent to a 5 in the input. Even if it doesn't work for all examples, it's a possible hypothesis. Let's see what happens with example 1.\n\nIn example 1's first row, the third element is 0, adjacent to 5. So according to this rule, it should become 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this suggests that the rule is not correct. But maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, in example 1's first row, the third element is 0. Let me check the input for that row. The input is:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0.\n\nSo the third element (index 2) is 0. The adjacent cells are:\n\nLeft: index 1 (5), right: index 3 (0), up: none, down: row 1, index 2 (5). So the cell has 5 in left and down. So according to the rule, it should be 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this suggests that the rule is incorrect.\n\nBut in example 2's first row, the third element is 0, adjacent to 5 (index 1), and it becomes 1. So why is it different in example 1?\n\nMaybe the rule is that the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is not part of a certain pattern. Or perhaps the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is not part of a certain region. For example, if the cell is part of a group of 0s that is surrounded by 5s, then it becomes 1.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is not a 5 itself. But that's the same as the previous rule.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples that do work. For example, in example 2, the rule works. In example 3, the first row's fourth and fifth elements are 0s adjacent to 5s and become 1s. So maybe the rule is that any 0 in the input that is adjacent to a 5 becomes 1. But why in example 1, the third element is 0 and adjacent to 5 but remains 0?\n\nMaybe there's an error in my analysis of example 1. Let me recheck example 1's output.\n\nExample 1's output for the first row is 5 5 0 0 1 1 1 5 0 0.\n\nSo the third and fourth elements are 0. The fifth, sixth, seventh are 1s. Let me check the input for those positions.\n\nIn the input, row 0, columns 4-6 are 0, 0, 0. The cell at (0,4) is adjacent to (0,3) which is 0, (0,5) which is 0, (1,4) which is 0, and (0,3) is 0. So no 5s adjacent. But in the output, it's 1. So this suggests that the rule is not based on adjacency to 5s.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe the transformation is something else. Let's think about the output of example 1. The 1s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first row, the fifth, sixth, and seventh elements are 1s. In the second row, the fifth, sixth, and seventh elements are 1s. In the third row, the fourth element is 5, and the fifth, sixth, seventh are 1s. So maybe the 1s are in positions where the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, a vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added in positions where the cell is in a certain pattern based on the input's 5s. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it becomes 1. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern of 0s and 5s. For example, in the input, if there is a 5 in the cell's row or column, then the cell becomes 1. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on the input's 5s, but only if the cell is in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Perhaps I should try to write a function that replaces 0s with 1s in positions that are adjacent to 5s, and see what happens. Even if it doesn't work for all examples, it's a possible hypothesis.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if the cell is 0, check if any of its four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) is 5. If so, replace with 1.\n\nLet's see what this does for example 1's first row:\n\nRow 0, col 2 (0) has left (5), down (5). So it would be replaced with 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this would be incorrect. But maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, in example 1's output, the third element is 0, but according to this rule, it should be 1. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nBut in example 2, this rule works. So perhaps there's another condition. Maybe the cell is replaced with 1 only if it is adjacent to a 5 and the cell is not part of a certain group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s where the cell is part of a certain pattern, like being in the middle of a group of 0s that is surrounded by 5s.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain position, like the middle of a certain pattern.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision. Based on the examples that do work, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that any 0 in the input that is adjacent to a 5 in the input becomes 1 in the output. Even if it doesn't work for all examples, it's a possible pattern.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if any adjacent cell is 5\n                if (i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 5) or (i < 9 and grid[i+1][j] == 5) or (j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 5) or (j < 9 and grid[i][j+1] == 5):\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would replace 0s with 1s if they are adjacent to 5s. Let's check example 1's first row. The third element (0) is adjacent to 5, so it would be 1. But in the output, it's 0. So this suggests that this code would not work for example 1. But perhaps the example's output is different. Or maybe I made a mistake in analyzing the example.\n\nWait, let me recheck example 1's output. The first row of output is 5 5 0 0 1 1 1 5 0 0. So the third and fourth elements are 0. So according to this code, those cells would be 1, but in the output they are 0. So this code would not produce the correct output for example 1. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe the pattern is something else. Let me think about the test input and see if I can find any patterns.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n5 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 0\n5 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 0\n5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0\n5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 5\n0 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 5\n0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is not given, but the task is to write the transformation function. So perhaps the pattern is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on the input's 5s. But without knowing the output, it's hard to say.\n\nMaybe the pattern is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the cell is in a certain shape. For example, if the cell is in a row or column that has a 5, then it becomes 1. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 1s are added where the cell is in a certain pattern, like being part of a diagonal or a line of 0s.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible hypothesis, even if it doesn't work for all examples. Given that example 2 and 3 seem to have 1s where the cell is adjacent to 5s, I'll proceed with that hypothesis, even if it doesn't work for example 1. Perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis of example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s where the cell is in a certain position, like the middle of a certain pattern.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s with 1s if adjacent to 5s, and see if it passes some examples. Even if it doesn't work for all, it's the best I can do.\n"
