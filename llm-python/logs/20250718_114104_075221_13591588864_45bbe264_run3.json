The output grid seems to expand or \"inflate\" certain values (like 8 and 5) into larger regions\n2. Values like 8 and 5 seem to be \"expanded\" into larger blocks in the output\n3. The value 2 seems to appear in the middle of these expanded blocks\n4. The value 3 seems to appear in certain positions in the output\n5. There's a pattern where certain values are \"spread out\" or \"inflated\" into larger regions\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Expands certain values (like 8 and 5) into larger regions\n- Adds a 2 in the middle of these expanded regions\n- Adds 3s in certain positions\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Expand 8s into a 5x5 block with 8s and a 2 in the center\n    # and expand 5s into a 5x5 block with 5s and a 2 in the center\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on the examples\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                # Expand 8 into a 5x5 block with 8s and a 2 in the center\n                for x in range(i-2, i+3):\n                    for y in range(j-2, j+3):\n                        if x >= 0 and x < 16 and y >= 0 and y < 16:\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = 8\n                # Add 2 in the center of the expanded block\n                transformed_grid[i+1][j+1] = 2\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 5:\n                # Expand 5 into a 5x5 block with 5s and a 2 in the center\n                for x in range(i-2, i+3):\n                    for y in range(j-2, j+3):\n                        if x >= 0 and x < 16 and y >= 0 and y < 16:\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = 5\n                # Add 2 in the center of the expanded block\n                transformed_grid[i+1][j+1] = 2\n    \n    # Add 3s in certain positions based on the examples\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on the examples\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                # Add 3s in a 3x3 block around the value\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if x >= 0 and x < 16 and y >= 0 and y < 16:\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = 3\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
