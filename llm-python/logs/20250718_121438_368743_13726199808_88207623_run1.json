          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a Python function that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input and output grids are 14x16. Let me compare them. The input has some numbers like 4, 2, 8, 0, and the output has similar numbers but with some changes. For instance, in the first input row, all zeros. The output also has all zeros. But in the second input row, there's a 4 and 2 in positions (1,5) and (1,6). The output for that row has 4, 2, 8 in positions (1,5), (1,6), and (1,7). Wait, maybe the 8 comes from some transformation of the original numbers?\n\nLooking at the third input row: the first few cells are 0, then 4,4,4,2. The output has 4,4,4,2,8,8,8. So maybe the 8s are generated from the 4s and 2s in some way. Like, maybe when there's a 4 followed by 2, it's replaced with 8? Or perhaps the 8s are generated based on some rule involving adjacent cells.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 1, there are 8s in positions where the input had 4s and 2s. For example, in the third input row, the 4s and 2 are in positions 3-5 and 6. The output has 8s in positions 7-9. Wait, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 adjacent to each other. Or perhaps the 8s are generated based on the sum of 4 and 2? 4+2=6, but that's not 8. Hmm, maybe not that.\n\nLooking at the fourth input row: there's a 4,4,4,2 in positions 3-6. The output has 8s in positions 7-9. So maybe when there's a sequence of 4s followed by 2, the 8s are generated in the next positions. Or maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells. Alternatively, maybe the 8 is a result of some kind of propagation. For example, if there's a 4 and a 2, then the 8 is generated in the next cell. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, there's a 8 in position (1,7) (second row, seventh column). The input for that position was 0. So maybe the 8s are generated based on some rule that depends on the surrounding cells. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells. For example, if there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8. But how does that work in the first example?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 in a certain pattern. Let me check another part. In the fifth input row of Example 1, the input is 0 0 0 4 4 4 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, the output for that row is 0 0 0 4 4 4 2 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 8s are generated in positions 7-9. The input had a 2 in position 6 (third column?), and then 0s. But in the output, after the 2, there are 8s. Maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 2 followed by some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 in a certain configuration. For example, if there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8. But in the first example, the input has a 4 and 2 in positions (1,5) and (1,6), and the output has 8 in (1,7). That seems to fit. Then, in the third row of input, the 4s and 2 are in positions 3-5 and 6, and the output has 8s in positions 7-9. That seems to fit. So maybe the rule is that whenever there's a 4 followed by a 2, the next cell is 8. But how does that work in the fourth input row? The fourth input row has 4,4,4,2 in positions 3-6. Then the output has 8s in positions 7-9. So that seems to fit. So maybe the 8 is generated when there's a 4 followed by a 2, and then the next cell is 8. But how does that work when there are multiple 4s before the 2?\n\nAnother example: in the fifth input row of example 1, the input is 0 0 0 4 4 4 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 4 4 4 2 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 8s are in positions 7-9. The input had a 2 in position 6 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), and then a 0. But the output has 8s after that. So maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 2 followed by some 0s, and then the 8s are generated in the next cells. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells. For example, if a 4 is adjacent to a 2, then the 8 is generated in some way. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2. The input has a 2 in some positions, and the output has 5s and 4s and 7s. For example, in the second input row of example 2, there's a 2 in position (1,6), and the output has a 5 in position (1,2) and (1,3), etc. Maybe there's a different rule for different numbers. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers and their positions.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 8s in example 1 are generated from the 4 and 2 in the input. For instance, 4 + 2 = 6, but that's not 8. Alternatively, 4 * 2 = 8. Oh, that's possible. So when there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8. That would explain the 8s in example 1. Let's check that.\n\nIn example 1, the second input row has 4 in position (1,5) and 2 in (1,6). The output has 8 in (1,7). So 4 and 2 are adjacent, and the next cell is 8. Similarly, in the third input row, the 4s are in positions 3-5, and 2 in 6. The output has 8s in 7-9. So maybe the 8 is generated when a 4 is followed by a 2. Then, the next cell is 8. But how does that work for multiple 4s followed by a 2?\n\nIn the fourth input row of example 1, the input has 4,4,4,2 in positions 3-6. The output has 8s in positions 7-9. So that would fit the rule that each 4 followed by a 2 generates an 8 in the next cell. But in this case, there are three 4s followed by a 2. So the 8s would be generated in the next three cells. That seems to fit.\n\nBut how does that work for other numbers? For example, in example 2, the input has a 2 in position (1,6). The output has 5 in (1,2) and (1,3). Maybe that's a different rule. Alternatively, maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers and their positions. For example, if a cell has a 4 and the cell to the right has a 2, then the cell to the right of that (i.e., two steps away) is 8. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain patterns. For example, in example 1, the 8s are generated in positions where there's a 4 followed by a 2. So the 8 is generated in the next cell. But how does that work in the fourth input row of example 1?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells. So whenever a 4 is followed by a 2, the next cell is 8. But how does that work when there are multiple 4s followed by a 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 in a cell and a 2 in the next cell. Then, the next cell is 8. So for example, if cell (i,j) is 4 and cell (i,j+1) is 2, then cell (i,j+2) is 8. But this would require that the 4 is followed by a 2, and then the next cell is 8.\n\nBut in example 1, the second input row has 4 in (1,5), 2 in (1,6). Then (1,7) is 8. So that fits. Similarly, in the third input row, the 4s are in (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), and 2 in (2,6). Then (2,7) is 8, (2,8) is 8, (2,9) is 8. So that would fit if the 4s are followed by 2, and then the next cell is 8. But how does that work for multiple 4s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and 2 in adjacent cells, and then the 8 is generated in the next cell. So for each occurrence of 4 followed by 2, the next cell is 8. But that would require that the 4 is followed by 2, and then the next cell is 8. So in the third input row, the 4s are in positions 3-5, and 2 in 6. So the 4 in position 3 is followed by 4 in 4, then 4 in 5, then 2 in 6. So the 4 in 5 is followed by 2 in 6, so the next cell (7) is 8. Then, the 4 in 3 is not followed by 2, but the 4 in 5 is followed by 2. So the 8 is generated in position 7. But in the output, positions 7-9 are 8s. So that would require that there are three 8s generated. How?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that when there's a 4 followed by a 2, the next cell is 8, and that 8 is then used to generate more 8s. But that seems a bit unclear.\n\nLooking at example 2. Let's take the input and output. For example, in the second input row of example 2, the input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is in position (1,6), and the output has 5 in (1,2) and (1,3). Maybe that's a different rule. For example, if there's a 2 in a certain position, then the cells to the left are filled with 5s. Or maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers and their positions. For example, in example 1, the 8s are generated when there's a 4 followed by a 2, and the 8 is generated in the next cell. In example 2, the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of propagation. For example, if a cell has a 4 and the next cell has a 2, then the next cell is 8. Then, if a cell has an 8, it might influence other cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain patterns. For example, in example 1, the 8s are generated in positions where there's a 4 and a 2 adjacent to each other, and then the next cell is 8. Similarly, in example 2, the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following rules:\n\n- For each cell (i,j), if the cell (i,j) is 4 and the cell (i,j+1) is 2, then the cell (i,j+2) is 8.\n- If the cell (i,j) is 2 and the cell (i,j+1) is 4, then the cell (i,j+2) is 8.\n- For other cases, maybe the cell is 0 or remains as is.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's test this against example 1.\n\nIn example 1's second input row: the cell (1,5) is 4, cell (1,6) is 2. So according to the rule, cell (1,7) should be 8. Which matches the output.\n\nIn the third input row of example 1, the cells (2,3) is 4, (2,4) is 4, (2,5) is 4, (2,6) is 2. So for (2,5) and (2,6), the next cell (2,7) is 8. Then, the next cell (2,8) is 8, and (2,9) is 8. But according to the rule, only the first occurrence of 4 followed by 2 would generate an 8. However, the third input row's 4s are followed by 2. So the first occurrence is (2,5) followed by 2. Then, the next cell (2,7) is 8. But the output has 8s in positions 7-9. So this rule might not explain that. Unless there are multiple 4s followed by 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that whenever there's a 4 followed by a 2, the next cell is 8. So for the third input row, the 4s are in positions 3-5, then 2 in 6. So the 4 in position 3 is followed by 4, so no. The 4 in position 4 is followed by 4, no. The 4 in position 5 is followed by 2. So the next cell (position 7) is 8. But in the output, positions 7-9 are 8. How to get three 8s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that the 4 and 2 are in a sequence, and the 8s are generated in the next cell. But how to get multiple 8s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells, and then the 8 is generated in the next cell. So, for example, if there's a 4 and a 2 in positions (i,j) and (i,j+1), then (i,j+2) is 8. But if there's a 4 in (i,j), then (i,j+1) is 2, then (i,j+2) is 8. If (i,j+1) is 2, and (i,j+2) is 4, then maybe (i,j+3) is 8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that the 4 and 2 are in a certain pattern, and the 8s are generated in the next cell. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are generated in a way that the 4 and 2 are in a certain pattern, and the 8 is generated in the next cell. For example, if there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8. But if there's a 2 followed by a 4, then the next cell is 8. But that would generate 8s in both directions.\n\nBut in example 1, the second input row has a 4 followed by a 2. So the next cell is 8. In the third input row, the 4s are followed by 2. So the next cell is 8. But how to get multiple 8s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in the same way as the 4 and 2 are in a certain pattern. For example, if there's a 4 and 2 in a row, then the next cell is 8. So for example, if there's a sequence of 4, 2, then the next cell is 8. But if there's a sequence of 4, 4, 4, 2, then the next cell is 8. But in that case, the 4s are followed by 2. So the first occurrence of 4 followed by 2 would generate an 8. But in the third input row, the 4s are followed by 2. So the first occurrence is (2,5) and (2,6). Then the next cell (2,7) is 8. But the output has 8s in positions 7-9. How to get three 8s?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input has a 2 in position (1,6) and the output has 5s in positions (1,2) and (1,3). Maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position. For example, if a 2 is in position (i,j), then the cells to the left are filled with 5s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position. For example, if there's a 2 in position (i,j), then the cell (i,j-2) is 5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position, and the cell to the left is filled with 5s. For example, in example 2's second input row, the 2 is in position (1,6). The output has 5s in (1,2) and (1,3). So that's two positions to the left. So maybe when there's a 2 in position (i,j), the cells (i,j-2) and (i,j-3) are 5. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are generated based on the presence of a 2 and some other numbers. For example, if there's a 2 in position (i,j), then the cells to the left are filled with 5s until a certain condition is met.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 8s are generated in positions where the input has 4 and 2 in adjacent cells, and the next cell is 8. But in example 2, the 5s and 7s are generated in different positions. So perhaps the transformation is based on multiple rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following:\n\n- If a cell is 4 and the cell to the right is 2, then the cell to the right of that is 8.\n- If a cell is 2 and the cell to the right is 4, then the cell to the right of that is 8.\n- For other numbers, the cell remains the same.\n\nBut how does that work for example 1's third input row, which has multiple 4s followed by a 2. Let's see: the third input row is 0 0 0 4 4 4 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 4 4 4 2 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 4s are followed by 2, so the next cell is 8. But in the input, the cell after the 2 is 0. So according to the rule, the next cell (position 7) is 8. Then, the next cell (position 8) is 8, and position 9 is 8. But how does that happen? Because the 8 is generated once, but the output has three 8s. So maybe the rule is that when there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8, and that 8 is then used to generate more 8s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that if there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells, then the next cell is 8, and that 8 is then used to generate more 8s. For example, if there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8. If there's a 2 followed by a 4, then the next cell is 8. But that seems like it would generate 8s in both directions.\n\nBut how does that work in example 1's third input row? The 4s are in positions 3-5, then 2 in 6. So the 4 in 5 is followed by 2 in 6, so position 7 is 8. Then, the 8 in 7 is followed by 0 in 8. But according to the rule, if there's an 8 followed by a 0, that doesn't trigger anything. So the output would have 8 in 7, but not 8 in 8 and 9. But the output has 8 in 7-9. So this rule doesn't explain that.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Perhaps the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers and their positions, and the output is generated by replacing certain patterns with other numbers.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the input has 4s and 2s, and the output has 8s in positions where there's a 4 followed by a 2. So maybe the 8 is generated when there's a 4 followed by a 2. But how to generate multiple 8s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that the 4 and 2 are in a certain pattern, and the 8s are generated in the next cell. For example, if there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells, then the next cell is 8. But if the 4 and 2 are in a sequence, then the next cell is 8. So for example, if there's a sequence of 4, 4, 4, 2, then the next cell is 8. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 followed by a 2, and then the next cell is 8. So for each occurrence of 4 followed by 2, the next cell is 8. But in the third input row, there's a 4 followed by 2, so the next cell is 8. But the output has three 8s. So perhaps the rule is that whenever there's a 4 followed by a 2, the next cell is 8, and this process is repeated until no more 4s and 2s are found.\n\nBut how to implement that in code?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that the 4 and 2 are in a certain pattern, and the 8s are generated in the next cell. For example, if there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells, then the cell to the right of that is 8. So, for example, if the input has a 4 and a 2 in positions (i,j) and (i,j+1), then (i,j+2) is 8. But this would generate one 8 per occurrence of 4 followed by 2.\n\nBut in example 1's third input row, the 4s are in positions 3-5, and 2 in 6. So the 4 in 5 is followed by 2 in 6. So (5,6) is 2. Then, (5,7) is 8. But the output has 8 in positions 7-9. So how to get three 8s?\n\nMaybe the rule is that whenever there's a 4 followed by a 2, the next cell is 8, and this is repeated for the next cells. For example, if the 4 is followed by 2, then the next cell is 8. Then, if the 8 is followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8 again. But that would require that the 8 is followed by a 2. But in the example, after the 8 in position 7, the next cell is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is generated in the next cell, and then the 8 is used to generate more 8s. But that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated based on the sum of the 4 and 2. 4+2=6, but that's not 8. Alternatively, 4*2=8. That fits. So when there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8. That would explain example 1's output. So for each occurrence of 4 followed by 2, the next cell is 8. So in the third input row, the 4s are followed by 2, so the next cell is 8. But how to get three 8s?\n\nWait, maybe the 4 and 2 are in positions (i,j) and (i,j+1). Then, the next cell (i,j+2) is 8. So if there are multiple 4s followed by 2, each of them would generate an 8. For example, in the third input row, there are three 4s followed by a 2. So the 4 in position 3 is followed by 4, so no. The 4 in position 4 is followed by 4, no. The 4 in position 5 is followed by 2, so the next cell (position 7) is 8. But the output has three 8s. So this would only generate one 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The second input row has a 2 in position (1,6), and the output has 5s in positions (1,2) and (1,3). So maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position. For example, if there's a 2 in position (i,j), then the cells to the left are filled with 5s. But how far to the left?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position, and the cell to the left is 5. For example, if a 2 is in position (i,j), then (i,j-1) is 5. But in example 2's second input row, the 2 is in position (1,6), and the output has 5 in (1,2) and (1,3). That's four positions to the left. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position, and the cell two positions to the left is 5. But that would require that the 2 is in position (i,j), and (i,j-2) is 5. For example, in example 2's second input row, the 2 is at (1,6), so (1,4) is 5. But the output has 5 in (1,2) and (1,3). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are generated based on the presence of a 2 in a certain position and the presence of other numbers. For example, in example 2's second input row, the input has a 2 in position (1,6), and the output has 5s in (1,2) and (1,3). Maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in position (i,j), and the cell (i,j-2) is 5. But that's just a guess.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a series of rules that replace certain patterns with other numbers. For example:\n\n- Replace any occurrence of 4 followed by 2 with 8 in the next cell.\n- Replace any occurrence of 2 followed by 4 with 8 in the next cell.\n- Replace any occurrence of 2 followed by 5 with 7 in the next cell.\n- Etc.\n\nBut how to determine these rules from the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following:\n\nFor each cell (i,j), if the cell (i,j) is 4 and the cell (i,j+1) is 2, then set cell (i,j+2) to 8.\n\nBut this would only generate one 8 per occurrence of 4 followed by 2. Let's test this against example 1's third input row. The third input row has 4,4,4,2 in positions 3-6. So the 4 in position 5 is followed by 2 in 6. So the next cell (position 7) is set to 8. But the output has 8s in positions 7-9. So this rule would only generate one 8, but the output has three. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is generated in the next cell, and then that 8 is used to generate more 8s. For example, if there's an 8 followed by a 0, then the next cell is 8. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that the 4 and 2 are in a certain pattern, and the 8s are generated in the next cell. For example, if there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8. Then, if there's an 8 followed by a 0, then the next cell is 8. But this seems like a stretch.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure about the exact pattern. But given the examples, I'll try to code a function that replaces 4 followed by 2 with 8 in the next cell. Let's see.\n\nSo, the code would iterate through each row and column, and for each cell (i,j), check if the cell is 4 and the cell to the right is 2. If so, set the cell two positions to the right to 8. But this would only handle one 8 per occurrence. However, in example 1, the third input row has three 4s followed by a 2, which would generate one 8, but the output has three 8s. So this approach would not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that the 4 and 2 are in a sequence, and the 8s are generated in the next cell for each 4 and 2. For example, if there's a sequence of 4s followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8 for each 4 in the sequence.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell, if it's 4 and the next cell is 2, then the cell after that is 8. This would handle some cases, but not all. Then, for other numbers like 2 and 5, perhaps there are other rules.\n\nBut how to handle example 2's second input row where there's a 2 in position (1,6) and the output has 5s in (1,2) and (1,3). Maybe that's a different rule, like replacing 2 with 5 in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers and their positions, and the output is generated by replacing certain patterns with other numbers. For example:\n\n- If a cell is 4 and the next cell is 2, then the cell after that is 8.\n- If a cell is 2 and the next cell is 4, then the cell after that is 8.\n- If a cell is 2 and the next cell is 5, then the cell after that is 7.\n- etc.\n\nBut how to determine these rules from the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the first rule: whenever there's a 4 followed by a 2, the next cell is 8. This would explain some of the examples, even if not all.\n\nSo, the code would loop through each cell, check if the current cell is 4 and the next cell is 2. If so, set the cell two positions ahead to 8.\n\nBut I need to make sure that this is implemented correctly.\n\nNow, considering the test input. Let's see what the test input has. For example, the second row of the test input is 0 4 4 4 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for this row is 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 4s are followed by 2, but the output has 5s in positions 2 and 3. This suggests that there's a different rule for this case. So maybe my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with the code that handles the 4 followed by 2 to generate 8, and see if that works for the examples.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Iterate over each cell\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(16):\n            # Check if current cell is 4 and next cell is 2\n            if j + 2 < 16 and transformed[i][j] == 4 and transformed[i][j+1] == 2:\n                transformed[i][j+2] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but in example 1's third input row, the 4s are followed by 2, so this code would set the next cell to 8. But the output has three 8s. So this code would only generate one 8, but the output has three. So this is not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should check for sequences of 4s followed by 2, and set the next cell to 8 for each 4 in the sequence.\n\nFor example, in the third input row, the 4s are in positions 3,4,5, and 2 in 6. So for each 4 in positions 3,4,5, if the next cell is 2, then set the next cell to 8. But how to check that.\n\nBut in this case, the 4 in position 3 is followed by 4, not 2. The 4 in position 4 is followed by 4. The 4 in position 5 is followed by 2. So only the 4 in position 5 would trigger the rule. So the code would set position 7 to 8. But the output has 8s in positions 7-9. So this code would not generate the other 8s.\n\nThis suggests that the initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the correct pattern is. Given that, perhaps I should consider that the transformation is based on the presence of certain patterns, such as replacing 4 and 2 with 8 in certain positions, and other numbers with other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following:\n\n- For each cell (i,j), if the cell is 4 and the cell to the right is 2, then the cell to the right of that is 8.\n- For each cell (i,j), if the cell is 2 and the cell to the right is 4, then the cell to the right of that is 8.\n- For each cell (i,j), if the cell is 2 and the cell to the right is 5, then the cell to the right of that is 7.\n- For each cell (i,j), if the cell is 5 and the cell to the right is 2, then the cell to the right of that is 7.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on example 2.\n\nIn example 2's second input row, the 2 is in position (1,6), and the output has 5 in (1,2) and (1,3). So perhaps the 2 in position (1,6) triggers the 5s in positions (1,2) and (1,3). But how?\n\nMaybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position, and the cells to the left are filled with 5s. For example, if there's a 2 in position (i,j), then the cells to the left are filled with 5s until a certain condition is met.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 4 followed by 2 with 8 in the next cell, even if it doesn't handle all cases. This is the best I can do based on the examples provided.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a Python function that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input and output grids are 14x16. Let me compare them. The input has some numbers like 4, 2, 8, 0, and the output has similar numbers but with some changes. For instance, in the first input row, all zeros. The output also has all zeros. But in the second input row, there's a 4 and 2 in positions (1,5) and (1,6). The output for that row has 4, 2, 8 in positions (1,5), (1,6), and (1,7). Wait, maybe the 8 comes from some transformation of the original numbers?\n\nLooking at the third input row: the first few cells are 0, then 4,4,4,2. The output has 4,4,4,2,8,8,8. So maybe the 8s are generated from the 4s and 2s in some way. Like, maybe when there's a 4 followed by 2, it's replaced with 8? Or perhaps the 8s are generated based on some rule involving adjacent cells.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 1, there are 8s in positions where the input had 4s and 2s. For example, in the third input row, the 4s and 2 are in positions 3-5 and 6. The output has 8s in positions 7-9. Wait, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 adjacent to each other. Or perhaps the 8s are generated based on the sum of 4 and 2? 4+2=6, but that's not 8. Hmm, maybe not that.\n\nLooking at the fourth input row: there's a 4,4,4,2 in positions 3-6. The output has 8s in positions 7-9. So maybe when there's a sequence of 4s followed by 2, the 8s are generated in the next positions. Or maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells. Alternatively, maybe the 8 is a result of some kind of propagation. For example, if there's a 4 and a 2, then the 8 is generated in the next cell. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, there's a 8 in position (1,7) (second row, seventh column). The input for that position was 0. So maybe the 8s are generated based on some rule that depends on the surrounding cells. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells. For example, if there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8. But how does that work in the first example?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 in a certain pattern. Let me check another part. In the fifth input row of Example 1, the input is 0 0 0 4 4 4 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, the output for that row is 0 0 0 4 4 4 2 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 8s are generated in positions 7-9. The input had a 2 in position 6 (third column?), and then 0s. But in the output, after the 2, there are 8s. Maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 2 followed by some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 in a certain configuration. For example, if there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8. But in the first example, the input has a 4 and 2 in positions (1,5) and (1,6), and the output has 8 in (1,7). That seems to fit. Then, in the third row of input, the 4s and 2 are in positions 3-5 and 6, and the output has 8s in positions 7-9. That seems to fit. So maybe the rule is that whenever there's a 4 followed by a 2, the next cell is 8. But how does that work in the fourth input row? The fourth input row has 4,4,4,2 in positions 3-6. Then the output has 8s in positions 7-9. So that seems to fit. So maybe the 8 is generated when there's a 4 followed by a 2, and then the next cell is 8. But how does that work when there are multiple 4s before the 2?\n\nAnother example: in the fifth input row of example 1, the input is 0 0 0 4 4 4 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 4 4 4 2 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 8s are in positions 7-9. The input had a 2 in position 6 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), and then a 0. But the output has 8s after that. So maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 2 followed by some 0s, and then the 8s are generated in the next cells. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells. For example, if a 4 is adjacent to a 2, then the 8 is generated in some way. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2. The input has a 2 in some positions, and the output has 5s and 4s and 7s. For example, in the second input row of example 2, there's a 2 in position (1,6), and the output has a 5 in position (1,2) and (1,3), etc. Maybe there's a different rule for different numbers. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers and their positions.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 8s in example 1 are generated from the 4 and 2 in the input. For instance, 4 + 2 = 6, but that's not 8. Alternatively, 4 * 2 = 8. Oh, that's possible. So when there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8. That would explain the 8s in example 1. Let's check that.\n\nIn example 1, the second input row has 4 in position (1,5) and 2 in (1,6). The output has 8 in (1,7). So 4 and 2 are adjacent, and the next cell is 8. Similarly, in the third input row, the 4s are in positions 3-5, and 2 in 6. The output has 8s in 7-9. So maybe the 8 is generated when a 4 is followed by a 2. Then, the next cell is 8. But how does that work for multiple 4s followed by a 2?\n\nIn the fourth input row of example 1, the input has 4,4,4,2 in positions 3-6. The output has 8s in positions 7-9. So that would fit the rule that each 4 followed by a 2 generates an 8 in the next cell. But in this case, there are three 4s followed by a 2. So the 8s would be generated in the next three cells. That seems to fit.\n\nBut how does that work for other numbers? For example, in example 2, the input has a 2 in position (1,6). The output has 5 in (1,2) and (1,3). Maybe that's a different rule. Alternatively, maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers and their positions. For example, if a cell has a 4 and the cell to the right has a 2, then the cell to the right of that (i.e., two steps away) is 8. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain patterns. For example, in example 1, the 8s are generated in positions where there's a 4 followed by a 2. So the 8 is generated in the next cell. But how does that work in the fourth input row of example 1?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells. So whenever a 4 is followed by a 2, the next cell is 8. But how does that work when there are multiple 4s followed by a 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 in a cell and a 2 in the next cell. Then, the next cell is 8. So for example, if cell (i,j) is 4 and cell (i,j+1) is 2, then cell (i,j+2) is 8. But this would require that the 4 is followed by a 2, and then the next cell is 8.\n\nBut in example 1, the second input row has 4 in (1,5), 2 in (1,6). Then (1,7) is 8. So that fits. Similarly, in the third input row, the 4s are in (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), and 2 in (2,6). Then (2,7) is 8, (2,8) is 8, (2,9) is 8. So that would fit if the 4s are followed by 2, and then the next cell is 8. But how does that work for multiple 4s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and 2 in adjacent cells, and then the 8 is generated in the next cell. So for each occurrence of 4 followed by 2, the next cell is 8. But that would require that the 4 is followed by 2, and then the next cell is 8. So in the third input row, the 4s are in positions 3-5, and 2 in 6. So the 4 in position 3 is followed by 4 in 4, then 4 in 5, then 2 in 6. So the 4 in 5 is followed by 2 in 6, so the next cell (7) is 8. Then, the 4 in 3 is not followed by 2, but the 4 in 5 is followed by 2. So the 8 is generated in position 7. But in the output, positions 7-9 are 8s. So that would require that there are three 8s generated. How?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that when there's a 4 followed by a 2, the next cell is 8, and that 8 is then used to generate more 8s. But that seems a bit unclear.\n\nLooking at example 2. Let's take the input and output. For example, in the second input row of example 2, the input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is in position (1,6), and the output has 5 in (1,2) and (1,3). Maybe that's a different rule. For example, if there's a 2 in a certain position, then the cells to the left are filled with 5s. Or maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers and their positions. For example, in example 1, the 8s are generated when there's a 4 followed by a 2, and the 8 is generated in the next cell. In example 2, the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of propagation. For example, if a cell has a 4 and the next cell has a 2, then the next cell is 8. Then, if a cell has an 8, it might influence other cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain patterns. For example, in example 1, the 8s are generated in positions where there's a 4 and a 2 adjacent to each other, and then the next cell is 8. Similarly, in example 2, the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following rules:\n\n- For each cell (i,j), if the cell (i,j) is 4 and the cell (i,j+1) is 2, then the cell (i,j+2) is 8.\n- If the cell (i,j) is 2 and the cell (i,j+1) is 4, then the cell (i,j+2) is 8.\n- For other cases, maybe the cell is 0 or remains as is.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's test this against example 1.\n\nIn example 1's second input row: the cell (1,5) is 4, cell (1,6) is 2. So according to the rule, cell (1,7) should be 8. Which matches the output.\n\nIn the third input row of example 1, the cells (2,3) is 4, (2,4) is 4, (2,5) is 4, (2,6) is 2. So for (2,5) and (2,6), the next cell (2,7) is 8. Then, the next cell (2,8) is 8, and (2,9) is 8. But according to the rule, only the first occurrence of 4 followed by 2 would generate an 8. However, the third input row's 4s are followed by 2. So the first occurrence is (2,5) followed by 2. Then, the next cell (2,7) is 8. But the output has 8s in positions 7-9. So this rule might not explain that. Unless there are multiple 4s followed by 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that whenever there's a 4 followed by a 2, the next cell is 8. So for the third input row, the 4s are in positions 3-5, then 2 in 6. So the 4 in position 3 is followed by 4, so no. The 4 in position 4 is followed by 4, no. The 4 in position 5 is followed by 2. So the next cell (position 7) is 8. But in the output, positions 7-9 are 8. How to get three 8s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that the 4 and 2 are in a sequence, and the 8s are generated in the next cell. But how to get multiple 8s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells, and then the 8 is generated in the next cell. So, for example, if there's a 4 and a 2 in positions (i,j) and (i,j+1), then (i,j+2) is 8. But if there's a 4 in (i,j), then (i,j+1) is 2, then (i,j+2) is 8. If (i,j+1) is 2, and (i,j+2) is 4, then maybe (i,j+3) is 8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that the 4 and 2 are in a certain pattern, and the 8s are generated in the next cell. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are generated in a way that the 4 and 2 are in a certain pattern, and the 8 is generated in the next cell. For example, if there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8. But if there's a 2 followed by a 4, then the next cell is 8. But that would generate 8s in both directions.\n\nBut in example 1, the second input row has a 4 followed by a 2. So the next cell is 8. In the third input row, the 4s are followed by 2. So the next cell is 8. But how to get multiple 8s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in the same way as the 4 and 2 are in a certain pattern. For example, if there's a 4 and 2 in a row, then the next cell is 8. So for example, if there's a sequence of 4, 2, then the next cell is 8. But if there's a sequence of 4, 4, 4, 2, then the next cell is 8. But in that case, the 4s are followed by 2. So the first occurrence of 4 followed by 2 would generate an 8. But in the third input row, the 4s are followed by 2. So the first occurrence is (2,5) and (2,6). Then the next cell (2,7) is 8. But the output has 8s in positions 7-9. How to get three 8s?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input has a 2 in position (1,6) and the output has 5s in positions (1,2) and (1,3). Maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position. For example, if a 2 is in position (i,j), then the cells to the left are filled with 5s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position. For example, if there's a 2 in position (i,j), then the cell (i,j-2) is 5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position, and the cell to the left is filled with 5s. For example, in example 2's second input row, the 2 is in position (1,6). The output has 5s in (1,2) and (1,3). So that's two positions to the left. So maybe when there's a 2 in position (i,j), the cells (i,j-2) and (i,j-3) are 5. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are generated based on the presence of a 2 and some other numbers. For example, if there's a 2 in position (i,j), then the cells to the left are filled with 5s until a certain condition is met.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 8s are generated in positions where the input has 4 and 2 in adjacent cells, and the next cell is 8. But in example 2, the 5s and 7s are generated in different positions. So perhaps the transformation is based on multiple rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following:\n\n- If a cell is 4 and the cell to the right is 2, then the cell to the right of that is 8.\n- If a cell is 2 and the cell to the right is 4, then the cell to the right of that is 8.\n- For other numbers, the cell remains the same.\n\nBut how does that work for example 1's third input row, which has multiple 4s followed by a 2. Let's see: the third input row is 0 0 0 4 4 4 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 4 4 4 2 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 4s are followed by 2, so the next cell is 8. But in the input, the cell after the 2 is 0. So according to the rule, the next cell (position 7) is 8. Then, the next cell (position 8) is 8, and position 9 is 8. But how does that happen? Because the 8 is generated once, but the output has three 8s. So maybe the rule is that when there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8, and that 8 is then used to generate more 8s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that if there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells, then the next cell is 8, and that 8 is then used to generate more 8s. For example, if there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8. If there's a 2 followed by a 4, then the next cell is 8. But that seems like it would generate 8s in both directions.\n\nBut how does that work in example 1's third input row? The 4s are in positions 3-5, then 2 in 6. So the 4 in 5 is followed by 2 in 6, so position 7 is 8. Then, the 8 in 7 is followed by 0 in 8. But according to the rule, if there's an 8 followed by a 0, that doesn't trigger anything. So the output would have 8 in 7, but not 8 in 8 and 9. But the output has 8 in 7-9. So this rule doesn't explain that.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Perhaps the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers and their positions, and the output is generated by replacing certain patterns with other numbers.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the input has 4s and 2s, and the output has 8s in positions where there's a 4 followed by a 2. So maybe the 8 is generated when there's a 4 followed by a 2. But how to generate multiple 8s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that the 4 and 2 are in a certain pattern, and the 8s are generated in the next cell. For example, if there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells, then the next cell is 8. But if the 4 and 2 are in a sequence, then the next cell is 8. So for example, if there's a sequence of 4, 4, 4, 2, then the next cell is 8. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated when there's a 4 followed by a 2, and then the next cell is 8. So for each occurrence of 4 followed by 2, the next cell is 8. But in the third input row, there's a 4 followed by 2, so the next cell is 8. But the output has three 8s. So perhaps the rule is that whenever there's a 4 followed by a 2, the next cell is 8, and this process is repeated until no more 4s and 2s are found.\n\nBut how to implement that in code?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that the 4 and 2 are in a certain pattern, and the 8s are generated in the next cell. For example, if there's a 4 and a 2 in adjacent cells, then the cell to the right of that is 8. So, for example, if the input has a 4 and a 2 in positions (i,j) and (i,j+1), then (i,j+2) is 8. But this would generate one 8 per occurrence of 4 followed by 2.\n\nBut in example 1's third input row, the 4s are in positions 3-5, and 2 in 6. So the 4 in 5 is followed by 2 in 6. So (5,6) is 2. Then, (5,7) is 8. But the output has 8 in positions 7-9. So how to get three 8s?\n\nMaybe the rule is that whenever there's a 4 followed by a 2, the next cell is 8, and this is repeated for the next cells. For example, if the 4 is followed by 2, then the next cell is 8. Then, if the 8 is followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8 again. But that would require that the 8 is followed by a 2. But in the example, after the 8 in position 7, the next cell is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is generated in the next cell, and then the 8 is used to generate more 8s. But that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated based on the sum of the 4 and 2. 4+2=6, but that's not 8. Alternatively, 4*2=8. That fits. So when there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8. That would explain example 1's output. So for each occurrence of 4 followed by 2, the next cell is 8. So in the third input row, the 4s are followed by 2, so the next cell is 8. But how to get three 8s?\n\nWait, maybe the 4 and 2 are in positions (i,j) and (i,j+1). Then, the next cell (i,j+2) is 8. So if there are multiple 4s followed by 2, each of them would generate an 8. For example, in the third input row, there are three 4s followed by a 2. So the 4 in position 3 is followed by 4, so no. The 4 in position 4 is followed by 4, no. The 4 in position 5 is followed by 2, so the next cell (position 7) is 8. But the output has three 8s. So this would only generate one 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The second input row has a 2 in position (1,6), and the output has 5s in positions (1,2) and (1,3). So maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position. For example, if there's a 2 in position (i,j), then the cells to the left are filled with 5s. But how far to the left?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position, and the cell to the left is 5. For example, if a 2 is in position (i,j), then (i,j-1) is 5. But in example 2's second input row, the 2 is in position (1,6), and the output has 5 in (1,2) and (1,3). That's four positions to the left. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position, and the cell two positions to the left is 5. But that would require that the 2 is in position (i,j), and (i,j-2) is 5. For example, in example 2's second input row, the 2 is at (1,6), so (1,4) is 5. But the output has 5 in (1,2) and (1,3). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are generated based on the presence of a 2 in a certain position and the presence of other numbers. For example, in example 2's second input row, the input has a 2 in position (1,6), and the output has 5s in (1,2) and (1,3). Maybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in position (i,j), and the cell (i,j-2) is 5. But that's just a guess.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a series of rules that replace certain patterns with other numbers. For example:\n\n- Replace any occurrence of 4 followed by 2 with 8 in the next cell.\n- Replace any occurrence of 2 followed by 4 with 8 in the next cell.\n- Replace any occurrence of 2 followed by 5 with 7 in the next cell.\n- Etc.\n\nBut how to determine these rules from the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following:\n\nFor each cell (i,j), if the cell (i,j) is 4 and the cell (i,j+1) is 2, then set cell (i,j+2) to 8.\n\nBut this would only generate one 8 per occurrence of 4 followed by 2. Let's test this against example 1's third input row. The third input row has 4,4,4,2 in positions 3-6. So the 4 in position 5 is followed by 2 in 6. So the next cell (position 7) is set to 8. But the output has 8s in positions 7-9. So this rule would only generate one 8, but the output has three. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is generated in the next cell, and then that 8 is used to generate more 8s. For example, if there's an 8 followed by a 0, then the next cell is 8. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that the 4 and 2 are in a certain pattern, and the 8s are generated in the next cell. For example, if there's a 4 followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8. Then, if there's an 8 followed by a 0, then the next cell is 8. But this seems like a stretch.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure about the exact pattern. But given the examples, I'll try to code a function that replaces 4 followed by 2 with 8 in the next cell. Let's see.\n\nSo, the code would iterate through each row and column, and for each cell (i,j), check if the cell is 4 and the cell to the right is 2. If so, set the cell two positions to the right to 8. But this would only handle one 8 per occurrence. However, in example 1, the third input row has three 4s followed by a 2, which would generate one 8, but the output has three 8s. So this approach would not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that the 4 and 2 are in a sequence, and the 8s are generated in the next cell for each 4 and 2. For example, if there's a sequence of 4s followed by a 2, then the next cell is 8 for each 4 in the sequence.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell, if it's 4 and the next cell is 2, then the cell after that is 8. This would handle some cases, but not all. Then, for other numbers like 2 and 5, perhaps there are other rules.\n\nBut how to handle example 2's second input row where there's a 2 in position (1,6) and the output has 5s in (1,2) and (1,3). Maybe that's a different rule, like replacing 2 with 5 in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers and their positions, and the output is generated by replacing certain patterns with other numbers. For example:\n\n- If a cell is 4 and the next cell is 2, then the cell after that is 8.\n- If a cell is 2 and the next cell is 4, then the cell after that is 8.\n- If a cell is 2 and the next cell is 5, then the cell after that is 7.\n- etc.\n\nBut how to determine these rules from the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the first rule: whenever there's a 4 followed by a 2, the next cell is 8. This would explain some of the examples, even if not all.\n\nSo, the code would loop through each cell, check if the current cell is 4 and the next cell is 2. If so, set the cell two positions ahead to 8.\n\nBut I need to make sure that this is implemented correctly.\n\nNow, considering the test input. Let's see what the test input has. For example, the second row of the test input is 0 4 4 4 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for this row is 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 4s are followed by 2, but the output has 5s in positions 2 and 3. This suggests that there's a different rule for this case. So maybe my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with the code that handles the 4 followed by 2 to generate 8, and see if that works for the examples.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Iterate over each cell\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(16):\n            # Check if current cell is 4 and next cell is 2\n            if j + 2 < 16 and transformed[i][j] == 4 and transformed[i][j+1] == 2:\n                transformed[i][j+2] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but in example 1's third input row, the 4s are followed by 2, so this code would set the next cell to 8. But the output has three 8s. So this code would only generate one 8, but the output has three. So this is not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should check for sequences of 4s followed by 2, and set the next cell to 8 for each 4 in the sequence.\n\nFor example, in the third input row, the 4s are in positions 3,4,5, and 2 in 6. So for each 4 in positions 3,4,5, if the next cell is 2, then set the next cell to 8. But how to check that.\n\nBut in this case, the 4 in position 3 is followed by 4, not 2. The 4 in position 4 is followed by 4. The 4 in position 5 is followed by 2. So only the 4 in position 5 would trigger the rule. So the code would set position 7 to 8. But the output has 8s in positions 7-9. So this code would not generate the other 8s.\n\nThis suggests that the initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the correct pattern is. Given that, perhaps I should consider that the transformation is based on the presence of certain patterns, such as replacing 4 and 2 with 8 in certain positions, and other numbers with other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following:\n\n- For each cell (i,j), if the cell is 4 and the cell to the right is 2, then the cell to the right of that is 8.\n- For each cell (i,j), if the cell is 2 and the cell to the right is 4, then the cell to the right of that is 8.\n- For each cell (i,j), if the cell is 2 and the cell to the right is 5, then the cell to the right of that is 7.\n- For each cell (i,j), if the cell is 5 and the cell to the right is 2, then the cell to the right of that is 7.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on example 2.\n\nIn example 2's second input row, the 2 is in position (1,6), and the output has 5 in (1,2) and (1,3). So perhaps the 2 in position (1,6) triggers the 5s in positions (1,2) and (1,3). But how?\n\nMaybe the 5s are generated when there's a 2 in a certain position, and the cells to the left are filled with 5s. For example, if there's a 2 in position (i,j), then the cells to the left are filled with 5s until a certain condition is met.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 4 followed by 2 with 8 in the next cell, even if it doesn't handle all cases. This is the best I can do based on the examples provided.\n"
