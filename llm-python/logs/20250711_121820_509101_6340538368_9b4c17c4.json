Identify the two region-fill colors (the most frequent non-2 values), e.g. 1 and 8.\n2. Find each region\u2019s bounding columns.\n3. Extract connected clusters of 2\u2019s.\n4. Erase the original red pixels (restoring the underlying fill).\n5. For each cluster, determine its region via a neighbor lookup, then compute a horizontal shift:\n   - In a \u201c1\u201d region shift right to the region\u2019s max column.\n   - In an \u201c8\u201d region shift left to the region\u2019s min column.\n6. Place the cluster at its new location, preserving rows and shape."

Identify the two region-fill colors (the most frequent non-2 values), e.g. 1 and 8.\n2. Find each region\u2019s bounding columns.\n3. Extract connected clusters of 2\u2019s.\n4. Erase the original red pixels (restoring the underlying fill).\n5. For each cluster, determine its region via a neighbor lookup, then compute a horizontal shift:\n   - In a \u201c1\u201d region shift right to the region\u2019s max column.\n   - In an \u201c8\u201d region shift left to the region\u2019s min column.\n6. Place the cluster at its new location, preserving rows and shape."
