          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from these examples. So, the task is to transform the input grid into the output grid based on the training examples. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a bunch of 6s and 5s in certain positions, and the output changes some of those. For instance, in the input, there's a row with 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 ... and in the output, that's the same. But then there's a row where the 5s are introduced. Also, there's a 8 and 2 in the input, and in the output, those are modified. Maybe the transformation involves some kind of replacement based on certain conditions.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 3, 7, and 1. The output changes some of those. For example, in the input, there's a 7 in the middle, and in the output, that's replaced by 7s in some positions, but then later there's a 1 that's replaced by 1s. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 3 in the middle and some 2s. The output seems to have some 3s and then 8s in certain positions. Also, there's a 2 that's replaced by 2s in some areas.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. Let me think about the positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle of the grid. The output seems to have 6s in the same positions, but then some 5s are introduced in certain areas. Also, the 8s and 2s are replaced in some way.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in Example 1, the output has 5s in certain positions where the input had 5s. But in the input, there's a row where the 5s are in the middle. Maybe the transformation is about propagating certain numbers to neighboring cells or based on some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them in the same positions. But then there's a line where the 5s are introduced. Maybe the 5s are replacing some 6s in certain areas. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a 3 in the middle. The output has the same 3s, but then there's a 7 that's replaced by 7s in some positions. Then there's a 1 that's replaced by 1s. Also, there's a 6 in the input that's replaced by 6s in the output. Wait, but in the output of Example 2, the 7s are in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions relative to other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is part of a certain shape or in a certain region, it's replaced with another value.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the output. For instance, in Example 1, the output has 5s in the middle of the grid. The input had 5s in the middle of the grid. But in the output, there are 5s in some positions. Wait, maybe the 5s are being propagated from their original positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if a cell is part of a certain pattern (like a line of 6s), then it's kept as is. But if there's a 5 in a certain position, it's replaced with 5s in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 6 in the middle, and the output has the same 6s. But then there's a 5 in the input that's replaced by 5s in the output. Maybe the 5s are part of a larger pattern.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nIn the input, there's a row where the 6s are in the middle. The output has the same 6s. Then, in the input, there's a row where the 5s start. In the output, those 5s are in the same positions. But then, in the input, there's a row with 0s and 6s, and in the output, those 6s are kept. But then, in some rows, the 5s are introduced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 3 in the middle and some 2s. The output has the same 3s, but then there's a 8 in some positions. Also, in the input, there's a 2 in the middle, and in the output, that's replaced by 2s in some areas.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions relative to other numbers. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a certain number, it's replaced. Or maybe it's about replacing numbers based on the presence of certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others in specific regions. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has the same 6s. Then, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, but in some rows, they are replaced with 5s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. For instance, in Example 1, the 5s are in the middle of the grid. But in the output, they are in certain positions. Maybe the 5s are being propagated from their original positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them in the same positions. But in other parts, like the bottom, there are 8s and 2s that are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if a cell is part of a group of 6s, then it's kept. But if there's a 5, it's replaced with 5s in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain region (like a rectangle), then it's replaced. For instance, in Example 1, the 6s are in a rectangle, and the 5s are in another region.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the examples, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others in specific patterns. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are kept, but the 5s are introduced. In Example 2, the 3s are kept, but the 7s are replaced with 7s. Also, the 1s are kept. Maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions, but only if they are in certain areas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the middle of the grid. The output has the same 5s.

But the 8s and 2s are replaced with 8s and 2s in certain positions.\n\nWait, but looking at the output of Example 1, there are some 8s and 2s that are in the input. For example, in the input, there's a row with 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 ... and in the output, that's replaced with 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 ...? Or maybe not. Wait, in the input of Example 1, the 8s are in the input, and in the output, they are in the same positions. But then there's a 2 in the input, and in the output, it's replaced by 2s in some positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. For instance, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them. The 5s are in the middle of the grid.

For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them. The 5s are in the middle of the grid, but in the output, they are in certain positions. Maybe the 5s are part of a certain pattern that is preserved.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the difference between input and output in each example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a row with 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 ... and the output has the same. Then, in the input, there's a row with 0 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 ... and the output has 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 5 5 ...? Or maybe not. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input for Example 1:\n\nRow 4: 0 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 4: 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the first four elements are 0 6 6 6, then the input has 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5, but the output has 6 6 6 followed by 5s. So in the input, there's a 5 in position 4 (assuming 0-based), and the output has 6 there. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the transformation is about replacing some 5s with 6s? But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them in the same positions. But in some rows, the 5s are replaced with 6s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them in the same positions. But then, in the input, there's a row with 0 6 6 6 5 5 ... and the output has 0 6 6 6 6 6 ... which suggests that the 5s are replaced with 6s.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent. Maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on the presence of other numbers. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 6, it's replaced with 6. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle, and the output has them. The 5s are in the middle of the grid, but in some rows, they are replaced with 6s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing certain numbers based on their positions. For example, in the input, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a different number. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them. The 5s are in the middle, but in some rows, they are replaced with 6s.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find a pattern that works for all three examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput has a row with 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 ... and the output has the same. Then, in the input, there's a row with 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 ... and the output has 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 ... So the 3s are kept, and the 8s are kept.\n\nBut in the output, there are some 8s and 2s. Wait, in Example 3's input, there's a row with 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 ... and the output has 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 ... So the 2s are kept.\n\nBut in the output of Example 3, there are some 8s in certain positions. So perhaps the transformation is about replacing certain numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain region, it's replaced with another number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions.

Maybe the 5s are part of a pattern that is replaced with 6s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others in a specific pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them in the same positions.

For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the middle of the grid. The output has the same 5s. But in other parts, like the bottom, there are 8s and 2s.

The 8s and 2s are kept.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of certain rules. For example, certain numbers are kept, and others are replaced based on their positions.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for common patterns in the examples. For instance, in Example 1, the output has 5s in certain positions. In the input, those positions have 5s. In Example 2, the output has 7s in certain positions, which were present in the input. So maybe the transformation is about keeping certain numbers and replacing others based on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a different number. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in certain rows and columns, and the output has them. But in other rows, the 5s are replaced with 6s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions.

Maybe I should look for the differences between input and output in each example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a row with 0 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 ... and the output has 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ... So the first four elements are 0 6 6 6, then the input has 5s, but the output has 6s in the next positions. So the 5s are replaced with 6s in some positions.

For example, certain numbers are kept, and others are replaced based on their positions.\n\nAnother idea: In all examples, the output has 0s in the same positions as the input.

Also, there's a 8 and 2 in the input, and in the output, those are modified. Maybe the transformation involves some kind of replacement based on certain conditions.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 3, 7, and 1. The output changes some of those. For example, in the input, there's a 7 in the middle, and in the output, that's replaced by 7s in some positions, but then later there's a 1 that's replaced by 1s. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 3 in the middle and some 2s. The output seems to have some 3s and then 8s in certain positions. Also, there's a 2 that's replaced by 2s in some areas.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. Let me think about the positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle of the grid. The output seems to have 6s in the same positions, but then some 5s are introduced in certain areas. Also, the 8s and 2s are replaced in some way.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in Example 1, the output has 5s in certain positions where the input had 5s. But in the input, there's a row where the 5s are in the middle. Maybe the transformation is about propagating certain numbers to neighboring cells or based on some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them in the same positions. But then there's a line where the 5s are introduced. Maybe the 5s are replacing some 6s in certain areas. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a 3 in the middle. The output has the same 3s, but then there's a 7 that's replaced by 7s in some positions. Then there's a 1 that's replaced by 1s. Also, there's a 6 in the input that's replaced by 6s in the output. Wait, but in the output of Example 2, the 7s are in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions relative to other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is part of a certain shape or in a certain region, it's replaced with another value.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the output. For instance, in Example 1, the output has 5s in the middle of the grid. The input had 5s in the middle of the grid. But in the output, there are 5s in some positions. Wait, maybe the 5s are being propagated from their original positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if a cell is part of a certain pattern (like a line of 6s), then it's kept as is. But if there's a 5 in a certain position, it's replaced with 5s in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 6 in the middle, and the output has the same 6s. But then there's a 5 in the input that's replaced by 5s in the output. Maybe the 5s are part of a larger pattern.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nIn the input, there's a row where the 6s are in the middle. The output has the same 6s. Then, in the input, there's a row where the 5s start. In the output, those 5s are in the same positions. But then, in the input, there's a row with 0s and 6s, and in the output, those 6s are kept. But then, in some rows, the 5s are introduced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 3 in the middle and some 2s. The output has the same 3s, but then there's a 8 in some positions. Also, in the input, there's a 2 in the middle, and in the output, that's replaced by 2s in some areas.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions relative to other numbers. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a certain number, it's replaced. Or maybe it's about replacing numbers based on the presence of certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others in specific regions. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has the same 6s. Then, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, but in some rows, they are replaced with 5s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced.

For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them in the same positions. But in other parts, like the bottom, there are 8s and 2s that are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if a cell is part of a group of 6s, then it's kept. But if there's a 5, it's replaced with 5s in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain region (like a rectangle), then it's replaced. For instance, in Example 1, the 6s are in a rectangle, and the 5s are in another region.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the examples, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others in specific patterns. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are kept, but the 5s are introduced. In Example 2, the 3s are kept, but the 7s are replaced with 7s. Also, the 1s are kept. Maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions, but only if they are in certain areas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the middle of the grid. The output has the same 5s.

But the 8s and 2s are replaced with 8s and 2s in certain positions.\n\nWait, but looking at the output of Example 1, there are some 8s and 2s that are in the input. For example, in the input, there's a row with 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 ... and in the output, that's replaced with 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 ...? Or maybe not. Wait, in the input of Example 1, the 8s are in the input, and in the output, they are in the same positions. But then there's a 2 in the input, and in the output, it's replaced by 2s in some positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. For instance, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them. The 5s are in the middle of the grid.

For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them. The 5s are in the middle of the grid, but in the output, they are in certain positions. Maybe the 5s are part of a certain pattern that is preserved.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the difference between input and output in each example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a row with 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 ... and the output has the same. Then, in the input, there's a row with 0 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 ... and the output has 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 5 5 ...? Or maybe not. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input for Example 1:\n\nRow 4: 0 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 4: 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the first four elements are 0 6 6 6, then the input has 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5, but the output has 6 6 6 followed by 5s. So in the input, there's a 5 in position 4 (assuming 0-based), and the output has 6 there. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the transformation is about replacing some 5s with 6s? But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them in the same positions. But in some rows, the 5s are replaced with 6s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them in the same positions. But then, in the input, there's a row with 0 6 6 6 5 5 ... and the output has 0 6 6 6 6 6 ... which suggests that the 5s are replaced with 6s.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent. Maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on the presence of other numbers. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 6, it's replaced with 6. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle, and the output has them. The 5s are in the middle of the grid, but in some rows, they are replaced with 6s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is about replacing certain numbers based on their positions. For example, in the input, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a different number. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them. The 5s are in the middle, but in some rows, they are replaced with 6s.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find a pattern that works for all three examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput has a row with 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 ... and the output has the same. Then, in the input, there's a row with 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 ... and the output has 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 ... So the 3s are kept, and the 8s are kept.\n\nBut in the output, there are some 8s and 2s. Wait, in Example 3's input, there's a row with 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 ... and the output has 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 ... So the 2s are kept.\n\nBut in the output of Example 3, there are some 8s in certain positions. So perhaps the transformation is about replacing certain numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain region, it's replaced with another number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers based on their positions.

For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain number. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them. The 6s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them.\n\nI think I'll have to make a guess and write a function that replaces certain numbers based on their positions.
