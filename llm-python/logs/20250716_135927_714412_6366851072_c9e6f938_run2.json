    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to take a 3x3 input grid and transform it into a 3x6 output grid. Let's look at the examples to see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is:\n0 7 0\n0 0 7\n0 7 7\n\nThe output is:\n0 7 0 0 7 0\n0 0 7 7 0 0\n0 7 7 7 7 0\n\nHmm. Let's see. The output is three rows, each with six elements. Looking at the first row of input, which is [0,7,0], the output's first row is [0,7,0,0,7,0]. So maybe the first three elements are the same as the input row, and then the next three are some transformation of the original? Or maybe it's mirrored or extended in some way.\n\nLooking at the second row of input: [0,0,7]. The output's second row is [0,0,7,7,0,0]. So the first three elements are the same as the input, then the next three are 7,0,0. Wait, that's the reverse of the original? Or maybe the original row is mirrored? The original row is 0,0,7. If you mirror it, it would be 7,0,0. But the output's next three elements are 7,0,0. So the second row of output is original row followed by mirrored row?\n\nWait, the first row of input is 0,7,0. The output's first row is 0,7,0,0,7,0. So the first three are the original, then the next three are 0,7,0 again? But that's the same as the original. Wait, maybe not. Wait the original row is 0,7,0. Then the next three elements are 0,7,0 again? But the output's first row is 0 7 0 0 7 0. So that's the original row followed by the same row? But that would be 0 7 0 0 7 0. But that's not exactly the same as the original. Wait, maybe it's the original row followed by the original row reversed? Let me check.\n\nOriginal first row: 0 7 0. Reverse is 0 7 0. So same as original. So the output first row is original followed by reversed. So 0 7 0 0 7 0. Which matches the output.\n\nBut then for the second row of input: 0 0 7. Reverse is 7 0 0. So output is 0 0 7 followed by 7 0 0. Which gives 0 0 7 7 0 0. Which matches the output.\n\nThird row of input is 0 7 7. Reverse is 7 7 0. So output is 0 7 7 followed by 7 7 0. Which gives 0 7 7 7 7 0. Which matches the output. So that seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern here is that each row in the input is duplicated, but the second part is the reversed version of the original row. So for each input row, the output row is the original row followed by the reversed version of the original row. That would make each output row 3+3=6 elements.\n\nLet me check the other examples to see if this holds.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n0 7 7\n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 7 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for the first input row [0,0,0], reversed is [0,0,0]. So output row is [0,0,0, 0,0,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond input row is [0,7,7]. Reversed is [7,7,0]. So output row is [0,7,7, 7,7,0]. But the output's second row is 0 7 7 7 7 0. Wait, that's not matching. Wait the output is 0 7 7 7 7 0. So the original row is [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0]. So the output would be [0,7,7, 7,7,0]. But the output is 0 7 7 7 7 0. Which is different. Wait, that's not matching. So maybe my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the second part is not the reversed row, but something else. Let me check the example 2 again.\n\nOriginal input row is [0,7,7]. The output row is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. So the first three elements are the original row, and the next three are 7,7,0. Which is the reversed row. But in this case, the original row is [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0]. So the output row would be [0,7,7, 7,7,0]. But the output in example 2 is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Which is different. Wait, that's not matching. So maybe my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the second part is not the reversed row. Let me think again. Let me look at example 2's output. The second row is 0 7 7 7 7 0. So the first three elements are 0,7,7. The next three are 7,7,0. Which is the reversed of the original row. But the original row is 0,7,7. Reversed is 7,7,0. So the output would be [0,7,7, 7,7,0]. Which matches the output. So that's correct. Wait, but the output is 0 7 7 7 7 0. So the second part is 7,7,0. Which is the reversed row. So yes, that's correct. So the hypothesis holds.\n\nSo example 2's output is correct under this hypothesis.\n\nNow example 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0\n7 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the first input row is [0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0]. So output row is [0,0,0, 0,0,0]. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond input row is [7,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,7]. So output row would be [7,0,0, 0,0,7]. But the output's second row is 7 0 0 0 0 7. Which matches. So yes.\n\nThird input row is [0,0,0], reversed is [0,0,0], so output row is [0,0,0, 0,0,0]. Which matches.\n\nSo this seems to hold for all examples. So the pattern is that each row in the input is duplicated, with the second part being the reversed version of the original row. So for each input row, the output row is original_row + reversed(original_row).\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n7 7 0\n0 7 0\n0 0 7\n\nSo each row is processed as follows:\n\nFirst row: [7,7,0]. Reversed is [0,7,7]. So output row is [7,7,0, 0,7,7].\n\nSecond row: [0,7,0]. Reversed is [0,7,0]. So output row is [0,7,0, 0,7,0].\n\nThird row: [0,0,7]. Reversed is [7,0,0]. So output row is [0,0,7, 7,0,0].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n7 7 0 0 7 7\n\n0 7 0 0 7 0\n\n0 0 7 7 0 0\n\nSo that's the transformed grid.\n\nSo the code needs to take each row of the input grid, create a new row by appending the reversed version of the original row.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n- For each row in the input grid (there are 3 rows), process it.\n\n- For each row, create a new row that is the original row followed by the reversed original row.\n\nSo, for example, for a row like [a, b, c], the new row is [a, b, c, c, b, a].\n\nSo in Python, for each row in the input grid, we can do:\n\nnew_row = row + row[::-1]\n\nThen, the output grid is a list of three such new rows.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = row + row[::-1]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but the input is a 3x3 grid. So each row is a list of 3 elements. So for example, the first example's input is:\n\n[\n [0,7,0],\n [0,0,7],\n [0,7,7]\n]\n\nThen, each row is processed as:\n\n[0,7,0] + [0,7,0][::-1] \u2192 [0,7,0, 0,7,0] \u2192 which is the first row of the output.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the first row is [0,7,0, 0,7,0], which is correct.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the second row is [0,0,7, 7,0,0], which is [0,0,7] + [7,0,0], which is correct.\n\nSo this code would work for all the examples.\n\nLet me check example 2's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[0,0,0], [0,7,7], [0,0,0]\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst row: [0,0,0] + [0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSecond row: [0,7,7] + [7,7,0] \u2192 [0,7,7,7,7,0]\n\nThird row: [0,0,0] + [0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSimilarly for example 3.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct transformation.\n\nTherefore, the code should be as described. So the Python function would take each row, reverse it, and append to the original row.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = row + row[::-1]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, the input is a list of lists. So for example, in Python, row[::-1] reverses the list. So for each row in grid, we take the row, reverse it, and concatenate.\n\nYes. So this should work.\n\nTesting this with the test input:\n\nTest input is:\n\n[\n [7,7,0],\n [0,7,0],\n [0,0,7]\n]\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nFirst row: [7,7,0] + [0,7,7] \u2192 [7,7,0,0,7,7]\n\nSecond row: [0,7,0] + [0,7,0] \u2192 [0,7,0,0,7,0]\n\nThird row: [0,0,7] + [7,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nWhich is the correct output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach. Therefore, the code should be written as such.\n"

Which matches.\n\nSo this seems to hold for all examples. So the pattern is that each row in the input is duplicated, with the second part being the reversed version of the original row. So for each input row, the output row is original_row + reversed(original_row).\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n7 7 0\n0 7 0\n0 0 7\n\nSo each row is processed as follows:\n\nFirst row: [7,7,0]. Reversed is [0,7,7]. So output row is [7,7,0, 0,7,7].\n\nSecond row: [0,7,0]. Reversed is [0,7,0]. So output row is [0,7,0, 0,7,0].\n\nThird row: [0,0,7]. Reversed is [7,0,0]. So output row is [0,0,7, 7,0,0].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n7 7 0 0 7 7\n\n0 7 0 0 7 0\n\n0 0 7 7 0 0\n\nSo that's the transformed grid.\n\nSo the code needs to take each row of the input grid, create a new row by appending the reversed version of the original row.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n- For each row in the input grid (there are 3 rows), process it.\n\n- For each row, create a new row that is the original row followed by the reversed original row.\n\nSo, for example, for a row like [a, b, c], the new row is [a, b, c, c, b, a].\n\nSo in Python, for each row in the input grid, we can do:\n\nnew_row = row + row[::-1]\n\nThen, the output grid is a list of three such new rows.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = row + row[::-1]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but the input is a 3x3 grid. So each row is a list of 3 elements. So for example, the first example's input is:\n\n[\n [0,7,0],\n [0,0,7],\n [0,7,7]\n]\n\nThen, each row is processed as:\n\n[0,7,0] + [0,7,0][::-1] \u2192 [0,7,0, 0,7,0] \u2192 which is the first row of the output.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the first row is [0,7,0, 0,7,0], which is correct.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the second row is [0,0,7, 7,0,0], which is [0,0,7] + [7,0,0], which is correct.\n\nSo this code would work for all the examples.\n\nLet me check example 2's input:\n\nInput rows:\n\n[0,0,0], [0,7,7], [0,0,0]\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst row: [0,0,0] + [0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSecond row: [0,7,7] + [7,7,0] \u2192 [0,7,7,7,7,0]\n\nThird row: [0,0,0] + [0,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSimilarly for example 3.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct transformation.\n\nTherefore, the code should be as described. So the Python function would take each row, reverse it, and append to the original row.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = row + row[::-1]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, the input is a list of lists. So for example, in Python, row[::-1] reverses the list. So for each row in grid, we take the row, reverse it, and concatenate.\n\nYes. So this should work.\n\nTesting this with the test input:\n\nTest input is:\n\n[\n [7,7,0],\n [0,7,0],\n [0,0,7]\n]\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nFirst row: [7,7,0] + [0,7,7] \u2192 [7,7,0,0,7,7]\n\nSecond row: [0,7,0] + [0,7,0] \u2192 [0,7,0,0,7,0]\n\nThird row: [0,0,7] + [7,0,0] \u2192 [0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nWhich is the correct output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach. Therefore, the code should be written as such.\n"
