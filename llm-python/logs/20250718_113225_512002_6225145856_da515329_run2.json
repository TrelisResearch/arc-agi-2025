The patterns seem to involve:\n\n1. 8s spreading out from certain positions in a grid\n2. 8s forming diagonal or cross-shaped patterns\n3. 8s being \"pushed\" outward from certain positions\n4. 8s being placed in specific positions based on their original positions\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads 8s from certain positions in a grid, creating patterns that resemble the examples.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 22x22 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(22)] for _ in range(22)]\n    \n    # Get the dimensions of the input grid\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Spread 8s from positions where the input is 8\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Spread 8s in all directions\n                for di in range(-2, 3):\n                    for dj in range(-2, 3):\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the original position\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 22 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 22x22 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(22)] for _ in range(22)]\n    \n    # Get the dimensions of the input grid\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Spread 8s from positions where the input is 8\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Spread 8s in all directions\n                for di in range(-2, 3):\n                    for dj in range(-2, 3):\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the original position\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 22 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
