Each row appears to be a cyclic shift of a base pattern\n3. The patterns seem to be based on sequential numbers that wrap around\n\nLet me analyze each example more carefully:\n\nExample 1: Uses sequence 1,2,3,4,5 repeating\nExample 2: Uses sequence 1,2,3,4,5,6 repeating  \nExample 3: Uses sequence 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 repeating\n\nThe key insight is that the output grids contain cyclic patterns where each row is a shifted version of the same sequence, and all zeros from the input are replaced with the appropriate values from these sequences.\n\nLooking at the structure:\n- Each row seems to be a cyclic shift of a base pattern\n- The shifts create a diagonal-like pattern\n- Non-zero values in input often correspond to the correct values in output\n\nLet me implement a solution that tries to identify the repeating pattern and reconstruct the grid accordingly:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    # Convert to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    input_grid = np.array(grid)\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Create output grid\n    output_grid = np.zeros((16, 16), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Try to identify the repeating pattern by analyzing non-zero elements\n    # Look for the most common sequence of consecutive numbers\n    all_numbers = []\n    for row in input_grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if val != 0:\n                all_numbers.append(val)\n    \n    # For now, let's implement a simpler approach based on what I can see:\n    # The output grids seem to follow a cyclic pattern where each row is \n    # a shifted version of a base sequence\n    \n    # Let's try to reconstruct by identifying the pattern in each row\n    # and extending it cyclically\n    \n    for i in range(16):\n        # For each row, find the pattern and extend it\n        row_data = input_grid[i]\n        \n        # Extract non-zero elements to identify the sequence\n        non_zero_elements = [x for x in row_data if x != 0]\n        \n        if len(non_zero_elements) > 0:\n            # Try to identify repeating pattern\n            # Look for the base sequence that repeats\n            pattern_candidates = []\n            \n            # Check for common patterns like 1,2,3,4,5 or 1,2,3,4,5,6 etc.\n            for pattern_length in range(3, 9):  # reasonable pattern lengths\n                if pattern_length <= len(non_zero_elements):\n                    candidate = non_zero_elements[:pattern_length]\n                    pattern_candidates.append(candidate)\n            \n            # Use a simple approach: if we can identify a clear cyclic pattern,\n            # use it;
