No, that's not right.\n\nLet me try another approach:\n- Row 4 in example 1: \"2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1\" \u2192 \"2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1\"\n- We see \"1 1 0\" at positions 3,4,5. The middle \"1\" (position 4) becomes \"2\", which is the value at position 6.\n- Similarly, in row 0: \"1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4\" \u2192 \"1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4\"\n- We see \"1 1 0\" at positions 3,4,5. The middle \"1\" (position 4) becomes \"4\", which is the value at position 6.\n\nActually, let me check if it's about what comes after the \"1 1 0\" pattern:\n- Row 4: positions 3,4,5 have \"1 1 0\", position 6 has \"2\", so position 4 becomes \"2\" \u2713\n- Row 0: positions 3,4,5 have \"1 1 0\", position 6 has \"1\", so position 4 becomes \"1\"... but it became \"4\".\n\nWait, let me recheck the positions:\nRow 0 input: [1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 4]\nRow 0 output: [1, 4, 0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 4]\nPositions 3,4,5: [1, 1, 0] \u2192 position 4 changes to 4\nPosition 6: 1\n\nHmm, that doesn't match.\n\nLet me look at the second example:\nRow 1 input: [1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3]  \nRow 1 output: [1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3]\nPositions 3,4,5: [1, 1, 0] \u2192 position 4 changes to 3\nPosition 6: 1\n\nStill not matching the pattern I thought.\n\nLet me think differently. Looking at the structure, it looks like there are repeated patterns, and the transformation affects the middle elements of certain subsequences.\n\nActually, let me check if it's about mirroring or copying values:\nIn example 1, row 4:\nInput:  [2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nOutput: [2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nThe pattern seems to be that in \"2 1 0 1 1 0 2\", the \"1 1\" in the middle gets changed to \"2 1\" to match the \"2\" that bookends it.\n\nSo the pattern might be: when we have \"X ... X 1 1 0 ... X\", the first \"1\" becomes \"X\".\n\nLet me verify:\n- Example 1, row 4: \"2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1\" \u2192 \"2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1\"\n  Pattern: \"2 ... 2 1 1 0 ... 2\" \u2192 first 1 becomes 2 \u2713\n\n- Example 1, row 0: \"1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4\" \u2192 \"1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4\" \n  Pattern: \"1 ... 1 1 1 0 ... 1\" \u2192 first 1 becomes 1 (no change) or \"4 ... 1 1 0 ... 1 4\" \u2192 first 1 becomes 4 \u2713\n\n- Example 2, row 1: \"1 3 0 1 1 0 1 3\" \u2192 \"1 3 0 1 3 0 1 3\"\n  Pattern: \"1 ... 1 1 1 0 ... 1 3\" \u2192 first 1 becomes 1 (no) or \"3 ... 1 1 0 ... 1 3\" \u2192 first 1 becomes 3 \u2713\n\nThis looks like the right pattern!\n\nThe rule seems to be: Find patterns of the form \"X ... X 1 1 0 ... X\" and change the first \"1\" after the second \"X\" to \"X\".\n\nBut that's not quite right either. Let me think of it as:\nFind \"X 1 1 0 Y\" and change the first 1 to X.\n\nNo, looking again:\nExample 1, row 0: \"1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4\" \nWe have at positions 3,4,5,6: \"1 1 0 1\" - this is \"X 1 1 0\" where X=1, so change first 1 to 1 (no visible change).\n\nActually wait:\n\"1 4 0",

Let me check if there's a pattern in specific rows:\n\nRow 0 (indexing from 0):\nExample 1: 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4 \u2192 1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4\nExample 2: 1 1 0 7 1 0 1 1 \u2192 1 1 0 7 1 0 1 1 (no change)\nExample 3: 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 \u2192 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 (no change)\n\nRow 1:\nExample 1: 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 \u2192 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 (no change)\nExample 2: 1 3 0 1 1 0 1 3 \u2192 1 3 0 1 3 0 1 3\nExample 3: 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 \u2192 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 (no change)\n\nWait, let me look at row 4 in examples:\n\nRow 4:\nExample 1: 2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 \u2192 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1\nExample 2: 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 \u2192 1 1 0 7 1 0 1 1 (this is actually row 3 in example 2 output)\nExample 3: 3 1 0 1 1 0 3 1 \u2192 3 1 0 3 1 0 3 1\n\nI think I see a pattern now:\n- In certain rows, when we have a pattern like \"X 1 1 Y\", it becomes \"X 1 X Y\"\n- Specifically, the second \"1\" gets replaced by the value that precedes the \"1 1\" sequence\n\nLet me recheck Example 1:\nRow 0: 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4 \u2192 1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4\nPositions: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nWe have \"1 1\" at positions 3,4 and it becomes \"1 4\" - the second 1 becomes 4 (which is at position 1)\n\nRow 4: 2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 \u2192 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1\nWe have \"1 1\" at positions 3,4 and it becomes \"2 1\" - the first 1 becomes 2 (which is at position 1)\n\nActually, let me look at this more carefully:\nRow 4 of Example 1: 2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1\nPositions:           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nThe \"1 1\" at positions 3,4 becomes \"2 1\" where 2 is from position 0 (the first element of that group)\n\nLet me check Example 3 Row 4: 3 1 0 1 1 0 3 1 \u2192 3 1 0 3 1 0 3 1\nThe \"1 1\" at positions 3,4 becomes \"3 1\" where 3 is from position 0\n\nAnd Example 2 Row 1: 1 3 0 1 1 0 1 3 \u2192 1 3 0 1 3 0 1 3  \nThe \"1 1\" at positions 3,4 becomes \"1 3\" where 1 is from position 0\n\nThis seems to be the pattern:\n- Find sequences of \"X 1 1 Y\" \n- Replace the middle \"1 1\" with \"X Y\" (or more precisely, replace the second 1 with X)\n\nWait, that's not right either. Let me recheck:\n\nExample 1 Row 0: 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4 \u2192 1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4\nThe \"1 1\" at positions 3,4 becomes \"1 4\" - so the second 1 becomes 4\n4 is at position 1 in the sequence \"1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4\"\n\nActually, let me look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking more carefully:\nExample 1 Row 0: 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4\nPositions:       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nOutput:          1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4\n\nThe change is at position 4: 1 \u2192 4\nPosition 4's value becomes the value at position 1.\n\nIs there a rule that says: if position i-1 and i are both 1, then position i gets the value from some earlier position?\n\nLet me check:\nPosition 4: was 1, position 3 was 1, so position 4 becomes value from position 1 (which is 4)\n\nExample 3 Row 4: 3 1 0 1 1 0 3 1 \u2192 3 1 0 3 1 0 3 1\nPosition 4 was 1, position 3 was 1, so position 4 becomes value from... position 0 (which is 3)\n\nExample 2 Row 1: 1 3 0 1 1 0 1 3 \u2192 1 3 0 1 3 0 1 3\nPosition 4 was 1, position 3 was 1, so position 4 becomes value from... position 0 (which is 1)\n\nHmm. In Example 1, it was position 1, in others it's position 0.\n\nLet me think of another pattern. What if it's about mirroring or copying based on structure?\n\nActually, let me look at this as: in certain structured rows, we copy the first element of a group to replace a 1.\n\nLet me check if rows are processed based on their structure or position:\n\nLooking at the grids, they seem to have a symmetric structure with empty rows (all 0s) separating patterned rows.\n\nLet me try a different approach: maybe it's about specific row indices that get processed.\n\nRows 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 are patterned rows in example 1 (rows 2 and 5 are all zeros).\n\nActually, let me just implement my best guess:\n\nIt seems like when we have consecutive 1s in certain rows, the second (or later) 1 gets replaced by some value from the same row - often the first value of that \"group\".\n\nMy hypothesis",

What if the transformation is about creating symmetry or completing patterns?\n\nIn Example 1:\nRow 0: 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4 \u2192 1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4\nRow 4: 2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 \u2192 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1\n\nI think I see it now:\n- When a row has the pattern [a, b, 0, c, c, 0, b, a], it becomes [a, b, 0, a, b, 0, b, a] or similar\n- No, that's not right either.\n\nLet me look at the specific changes:\nExample 1 Row 0: 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4 \u2192 1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4\nPositions:           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nChanged position 4:  1 \u2192 4\n\nExample 1 Row 4: 2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 \u2192 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1  \nChanged position 3:  1 \u2192 2\n\nIt looks like when we have a pattern like [a, b, 0, c, c, 0, a, b] it becomes [a, b, 0, a, b, 0, a, b] or similar logic.\n\nActually, let me look at it column-wise:\nLooking at pairs of columns (1,6) and (2,7):\nExample 1 Row 0: col1=4, col6=1 and col2=0, col7=4\nAfter: col1=4, col6=1, col2=0, col7=4 (same)\nBut col3=1\u21921, col4=1\u21924\n\nLet me try a different approach. What if it's about matching patterns in symmetric positions?\n\nLooking more carefully at Example 1:\nRow 0: [1,4,0,1,1,0,1,4] \u2192 [1,4,0,1,4,0,1,4]\nPositions 0,7: 1,4 \u2192 1,4 (same)\nPositions 1,6: 4,1 \u2192 4,1 (same)  \nPositions 2,5: 0,0 \u2192 0,0 (same)\nPositions 3,4: 1,1 \u2192 1,4 (changed!)\n\nThe change is at symmetric inner positions. When positions (3,4) both have 1, position 4 changes to match what?\n\nRow 4: [2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1] \u2192 [2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1]\nPositions 3,4: 1,1 \u2192 2,1\nSo position 3 changes to 2 (which is at position 0 and 6).\n\nI think the pattern is:\n- For rows with pattern [a,b,0,c,c,0,b,a], change the inner c values to match a.\n- But that's not quite right either.\n\nLet me check Example 3:\nRow 4: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1] \u2192 [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1] (no change - all 1s)\nRow 6: [3,1,0,1,1,0,3,1] \u2192 [3,1,0,3,1,0,3,1]\nPositions 3,4: 1,1 \u2192 3,1\nPosition 3 changed to 3 (which matches positions 0 and 6).\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\nIn rows where positions 0 and 7 are equal, and positions 1 and 6 are equal, and positions 2 and 5 are equal, if positions 3 and 4 are equal, then position 3 changes to match position 0.\n\nLet me verify with Example 1:\nRow 0: [1,4,0,1,1,0,1,4] - positions 0,7=1,4; 1,6=4,1; 2,5=0,0; 3,4=1,1\nPosition 3 should change to match position 0=1, but it's already 1.\nPosition 4 should change to match position 0=1, but it's already 1.\nActually it changed to 4, which is position 7.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\nRow 0: [1,4,0,1,1,0,1,4] \u2192 [1,4,0,1,4,0,1,4]\nPosition 4 changed from 1 to 4. Position 4 should take the value from position 7=4. \u2713\n\nRow 4: [2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1] \u2192 [2,1,0,2,1,0,2,1]\nPosition 3 changed from 1 to 2. Position 3 should take the value from position 0=2. \u2713\n\nSo the pattern is:\n- In rows where positions (0,7), (1,6), (2,5) are symmetric pairs, if positions (3,4) are equal, then:\n  - Position 3 takes the value of position 0\n  - Position 4 takes the value of position 7\n\nLet me verify with all examples:\n\nExample 1 Row 0: [1,",

It seems like there might be a pattern based on the structure around certain key positions.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- In Example 1, it looks like in certain rows, when there's a sequence like \"1 1 0 1 1\", some of the 1s are being changed.\n- In row 0: 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4 \u2192 1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4 (the 5th element changed)\n- In row 3: 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 \u2192 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 1 (the 2nd element changed)\n\nActually, let me look at this by comparing corresponding positions:\n\nExample 1:\nRow 0: 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4 \u2192 1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4\nRow 4: 2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 \u2192 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1\n\nIt seems like there's a pattern where in certain configurations, numbers are being propagated or changed based on neighbors.\n\nLet me try a different approach: look for symmetric or repetitive patterns.\n\nActually, looking at it again:\n- In row 0 and row 6 we have the same pattern\n- In row 1 and row 7 we have the same pattern\n- Row 3 and the transformation\n\nLet me check if it's about mirroring or some kind of propagation.\n\nLooking at Example 3 more carefully:\nInput:\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1\n...\n3 1 0 1 1 0 3 1\nOutput:\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1\n...\n3 1 0 3 1 0 3 1\n\nSo in the last row, positions changed from 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 to 3 1 0 3 1 0 3 1.\nThe 1s at positions 0, 3, and 6 changed to 3s.\n\nThis looks like the 3s from the original row are \"propagating\" to replace some 1s.\n\nLet me check Example 1 again:\nRow 4: 2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 \u2192 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1\nThe 1 at position 3 changed to 2 - matching the 2s in the same row.\n\nAnd row 0: 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4 \u2192 1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4\nThe 1 at position 4 changed to 4 - matching the 4s in the same row.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 \u2192 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 1\nThe 1 at position 1 changed to 4 - matching the 4s that appear later.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: in certain rows, 1s are being replaced by other numbers that exist in the same row, following some rule.\n\nLooking more systematically:\nIt seems like 1s that are between two identical non-zero numbers get replaced by that number.\n\nLet me verify:\nExample 1, Row 0: 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4 \nCheck position 4 (value 1): neighbors are position 3 (1) and position 5 (0). Not between two identical.\n\nActually, let me look at it as: 1s that are part of a pattern like \"X 1 1 Y\" where X=Y and X\u22600 get the first 1 replaced by X.\n\nRow 0: 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4\nPosition 3,4 are both 1, left neighbor of first 1 is 0, right neighbor of second 1 is 0. 0\u22600 is false, but 0=0, so this doesn't fit.\n\nLet me try: 1s that are part of \"X 1 1 X\" pattern where X\u22600 get changed to X.\nRow 0: 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4 \nPosition 3,4 are 1,1. Left of pos 3 is 0, right of pos 4 is 0. So 0 1 1 0 - this doesn't match.\n\nWait, let me recheck the exact values:\nRow 0: [1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 4] \u2192 [1, 4, 0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 4]\nThe change is at index 4: 1 \u2192 4\nIndex 4 has value 1, left neighbor (index 3) is 1, right neighbor (index 5) is 0.\nBut index 1 is 4 and index 7 is 4. Maybe it's about matching the first/last elements?\n\nActually, let me look at this as a pattern replacement:\nIn rows that have a structure like [X, ..., X] where there are 1s in between, some 1s get replaced by X.\n\nBut looking at row 0: [1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 4] - it starts with 1, ends with 4.\nRow 4 in example 1: [2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1] \u2192 [2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nThis starts with 2 and ends with 1. The change at index 3: 1 \u2192 2. The 2 matches the first element.\n\nHmm. Let me look at a simpler pattern. What if it's about the first element of the row determining what some 1s become?\n\nRow 4 example 1: starts with 2, so 1 at position 3 becomes 2.\nRow 0 example 1: starts with 1, but 1 at position 4 becomes 4 (which is the element at position 1 and 7).\n\nLet me try a different hypothesis:\nWhat if 1s that are between two identical elements get replaced by that element?\n\nRow 0 example 1: 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4 \nIndex 3,4 both are 1. Left of index 3 is 0, right of index 4 is 0. 0 \u2260 0 is false.\n\nRow 4 example 1: 2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1\nIndex 3,4 both are 1. Left of index 3 is 0, right of index 4 is 0",

Looking at positions that change:\n- It seems like certain positions are being updated to match a pattern from elsewhere in the grid.\n\nActually, let me look at this systematically. In each case, it looks like certain \"template\" rows are being used to modify other rows.\n\nThe most consistent pattern I can see is that for some rows, values at certain column positions are being changed to match values from other column positions in the same row or from template rows.\n\nLet me try to identify a concrete rule:\n\nLooking at Example 1 again:\n- The 4th column (index 3) in some rows is being changed to match the 2nd column (index 1) value in specific contexts.\n\nActually, let me re-examine the full grid transformation:\n\nIt looks like the transformation is about making certain positions consistent with a pattern. Let me check if it's about making positions (0,3) and (4,7) consistent with positions (1,2) and (5,6) or something similar.\n\nAfter more careful analysis, I think the pattern is:\n- In rows that have specific values, certain positions are updated to create a consistent pattern across the grid.\n- Specifically, it looks like positions 0,1,4,5 might be related to positions 2,3,6,7.\n\nBut let me try a different approach. What if the transformation is about \"propagating\" certain values?\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nRow 1: 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4 \u2192 1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4\nThe change is at index 4 (0-indexed), changing from 1 to 4.\n\nRow 2 stays the same.\nRow 4: 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 \u2192 1 4 0 1 1 0 1 1  \nThe change is at index 1, changing from 1 to 4.\n\nThis looks like it's making certain positions consistent within a pattern.\n\nLet me hypothesize: The transformation makes certain symmetric positions consistent with a rule.\n\nLooking at all examples, it seems like the transformation modifies specific positions to maintain consistency in a 2x2 pattern or similar.\n\nLet me write a solution based on my best understanding:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Based on the pattern analysis, it seems like we need to make certain\n    # positions consistent.

Looking at what triggers the change:\n- It seems like when there's a pair of identical non-zero values separated by a 0, something happens\n- Or when there's a repeating pattern in a row\n\nActually, let me look at this more systematically:\n\nIn each example, I see a pattern where certain 1s are being changed to match other numbers in the same column or row.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- In rows with a specific structure (like having pairs of same numbers), some values change\n- The changes seem to propagate or mirror values\n\nLet me try a different approach: maybe the transformation is about mirroring or copying values in specific patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again:\n- Row 0: \"1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4\" \u2192 \"1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4\"\n- Position (0,4) changes from 1 to 4 (matching the 4 in position (0,1))\n\nIn Example 2:\n- Row 1: \"1 3 0 1 1 0 1 3\" \u2192 \"1 3 0 1 3 0 1 3\"  \n- Position (1,4) changes from 1 to 3 (matching the 3 in position (1,1))\n\nIn Example 3:\n- Row 4: \"3 1 0 1 1 0 3 1\" \u2192 \"3 1 0 3 1 0 3 1\"\n- Position (4,3) changes from 1 to 3 (matching the 3 in position (4,0))\n\nI think I see the pattern now!\n\nIn certain rows, when we have a structure like [A, B, 0, C, C, 0, A, B], the second C gets changed to match A.\nMore precisely: if a row has a pattern where positions 0 and 6 have the same value A, and positions 3 and 4 have the same value C, then position 3 (or 4) gets changed to A.\n\nActually, let me recheck:\nExample 1 Row 0: [1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 4] \u2192 [1, 4, 0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 4]\n- Positions 0,6 are both 1\n- Positions 3,4 are both 1 initially\n- Position 4 changes to 4 (which is at position 1)\n\nHmm, that's not right either.\n\nLet me look at it as: in rows where there's a repeating pattern with 0 separators, values get adjusted to match the \"outer\" values.\n\nActually, let me think of it this way:\nIn rows that follow the pattern [X, Y, 0, A, A, 0, X, Z], the second A gets changed to Y.\n\nChecking Example 1 Row 0: [1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 4] \u2192 [1, 4, 0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 4]\n- X=1, Y=4, A=1, Z=4\n- Second A (position 4) changes to Y=4. \u2713\n\nChecking Example 2 Row 1: [1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3] \u2192 [1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3]  \n- X=1, Y=3, A=1, Z=3\n- Second A (position 4) changes to Y=3. \u2713\n\nChecking Example 3 Row 4: [3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1] \u2192 [3, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1]\n- X=3, Y=1, A=1, Z=1\n- Second A (position 4) should change to Y=1, but it's already 1. But position 3 changes from 1 to 3.\n- Wait, that's position 3 that changes to X=3.\n\nLet me reconsider: maybe it's position 3 that changes to X.\nExample 1 Row 0: position 3 (0-indexed) changes from 1 to 1 (no visible change) but position 4 changes from 1 to 4.\nActually, position 4 changes from 1 to 4. \n\nWait, I think I got the pattern wrong. Let me recheck Example 1:\nInput row 0: [1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 4]\nOutput row 0: [1, 4, 0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 4]\nThe change is at index 4: from 1 to 4.\n\nIn the pattern [X, Y, 0, A, A, 0, X, Z], index 4 (the second A) changes to Y.\n\nLet me verify all examples:\nExample 1: X=1, Y=4, A=1. Index 4 changes from A=1 to Y=4. \u2713\nExample 2: X=1, Y=3, A=1. Index 4 changes from A=1 to Y=3. \u2713  \nExample 3: X=3, Y=1, A=1. Index 4 changes from A=1 to Y=1. (No visible change since it's already 1, but index 3 changes from 1 to 3 = X)\n\nFor Example 3, it seems index 3 changes to X instead. Let me see if there's a rule:\nIf A equals Y, then index 3 changes to X.\nIf A differs from Y, then index 4 changes to Y.\n\nBut in Example 3: A=1, Y=1, so A equals Y, so index 3 should change to X=3. \u2713\n\nLet me verify this rule with all examples:\nExample 1: A=1, Y=4. A\u2260Y, so index 4 changes to Y=4. \u2713\nExample 2: A=1, Y=3. A\u2260Y, so index 4 changes to Y=3. \u2713\nExample 3: A=1, Y=1. A=Y, so index 3 changes to X=3. \u2713\n\nThis looks like the pattern!\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Apply the transformation to each row\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        row = grid[i]\n        # Check if row follows the pattern [X, Y, 0, A, A, 0, X, Z]\n        if len(row) == 8 and row[2] == 0 and row[5] == 0 and row[0] == row[6]:\n            X = row[0]\n            Y = row[1]\n            A",

The middle \"1\" (position 4) becomes \"4\", which is the value at position 6.\n\nActually, let me check if it's about what comes after the \"1 1 0\" pattern:\n- Row 4: positions 3,4,5 have \"1 1 0\", position 6 has \"2\", so position 4 becomes \"2\" \u2713\n- Row 0: positions 3,4,5 have \"1 1 0\", position 6 has \"1\", so position 4 becomes \"1\"... but it became \"4\".\n\nWait, let me recheck the positions:\nRow 0 input: [1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 4]\nRow 0 output: [1, 4, 0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 4]\nPositions 3,4,5: [1, 1, 0] \u2192 position 4 changes to 4\nPosition 6: 1\n\nHmm, that doesn't match.\n\nLet me look at the second example:\nRow 1 input: [1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3]  \nRow 1 output: [1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3]\nPositions 3,4,5: [1, 1, 0] \u2192 position 4 changes to 3\nPosition 6: 1\n\nStill not matching the pattern I thought.\n\nLet me think differently. Looking at the structure, it looks like there are repeated patterns, and the transformation affects the middle elements of certain subsequences.\n\nActually, let me check if it's about mirroring or copying values:\nIn example 1, row 4:\nInput:  [2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nOutput: [2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nThe pattern seems to be that in \"2 1 0 1 1 0 2\", the \"1 1\" in the middle gets changed to \"2 1\" to match the \"2\" that bookends it.\n\nSo the pattern might be: when we have \"X ... X 1 1 0 ... X\", the first \"1\" becomes \"X\".\n\nLet me verify:\n- Example 1, row 4: \"2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1\" \u2192 \"2 1 0 2 1 0 2 1\"\n  Pattern: \"2 ... 2 1 1 0 ... 2\" \u2192 first 1 becomes 2 \u2713\n\n- Example 1, row 0: \"1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4\" \u2192 \"1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4\" \n  Pattern: \"1 ... 1 1 1 0 ... 1\" \u2192 first 1 becomes 1 (no change) or \"4 ... 1 1 0 ... 1 4\" \u2192 first 1 becomes 4 \u2713\n\n- Example 2, row 1: \"1 3 0 1 1 0 1 3\" \u2192 \"1 3 0 1 3 0 1 3\"\n  Pattern: \"1 ... 1 1 1 0 ... 1 3\" \u2192 first 1 becomes 1 (no) or \"3 ... 1 1 0 ... 1 3\" \u2192 first 1 becomes 3 \u2713\n\nThis looks like the right pattern!\n\nThe rule seems to be: Find patterns of the form \"X ... X 1 1 0 ... X\" and change the first \"1\" after the second \"X\" to \"X\".\n\nBut that's not quite right either. Let me think of it as:\nFind \"X 1 1 0 Y\" and change the first 1 to X.\n\nNo, looking again:\nExample 1, row 0: \"1 4 0 1 1 0 1 4\" \nWe have at positions 3,4,5,6: \"1 1 0 1\" - this is \"X 1 1 0\" where X=1, so change first 1 to 1 (no visible change).\n\nActually wait:\n\"1 4 0",
