              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation seems to involve:\n1. Preserving the outermost layer (the first and last rows and columns)\n2. Transforming the inner grid in a way that spreads values from the edges inward\n3. Creating a sort of \"spreading\" effect where values from the edges influence the inner grid\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Preserves the outermost layer\n- Spreads values from the edges inward in a specific pattern\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the size of the grid\n    size = len(grid)\n    \n    # Preserve the outermost layer\n    for i in range(size):\n        transformed_grid[i][0] = grid[i][0]\n        transformed_grid[i][size-1] = grid[i][size-1]\n    \n    # Spread values from the edges inward\n    for i in range(1, size-1):\n        for j in range(1, size-1):\n            # Spread value from the left\n            if grid[i][j-1] != 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j-1]\n            # Spread value from the top\n            elif grid[i-1][j] != 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            # Spread value from the right\n            elif grid[i][j+1] != 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j+1]\n            # Spread value from the bottom\n            elif grid[i+1][j] != 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i+1][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the size of the grid\n    size = len(grid)\n    \n    # Preserve the outermost layer\n    for i in range(size):\n        transformed_grid[i][0] = grid[i][0]\n        transformed_grid[i][size-1] = grid[i][size-1]\n    \n    # Spread values from the edges inward\n    for i in range(1, size-1):\n        for j in range(1, size-1):\n            # Spread value from the left\n            if grid[i][j-1] != 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j-1]\n            # Spread value from the top\n            elif grid[i-1][j] != 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            # Spread value from the right\n            elif grid[i][j+1] != 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j+1]\n            # Spread value from the bottom\n            elif grid[i+1][j] != 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i+1][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
