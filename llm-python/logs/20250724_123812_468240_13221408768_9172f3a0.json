Take each cell in the 3\u00d73 input grid\n2. Expand it to a 3\u00d73 block in the 9\u00d79 output grid\n3. The position of each input cell (i,j) maps to output block at rows (3*i to 3*i+2) and columns (3*j to 3*j+2)\n4. All cells in each block have the same value as the original input cell\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize a 9x9 output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Process each cell in the 3x3 input grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Get the value from the input grid\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            \n            # Calculate the corresponding block position in the 9x9 grid\n            start_row = 3 * i\n            end_row = start_row + 3\n            start_col = 3 * j\n            end_col = start_col + 3\n            \n            # Fill the 3x3 block with the value\n            for row in range(start_row, end_row):\n                for col in range(start_col, end_col):\n                    output_grid[row][col] = value\n    \n    return output_grid\n```",

Take each cell in the 3\u00d73 input grid\n2. Expand it to a 3\u00d73 block in the 9\u00d79 output grid\n3. The position of each input cell (i,j) maps to output block at rows (3*i to 3*i+2) and columns (3*j to 3*j+2)\n4. All cells in each block have the same value as the original input cell\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize a 9x9 output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Process each cell in the 3x3 input grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Get the value from the input grid\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            \n            # Calculate the corresponding block position in the 9x9 grid\n            start_row = 3 * i\n            end_row = start_row + 3\n            start_col = 3 * j\n            end_col = start_col + 3\n            \n            # Fill the 3x3 block with the value\n            for row in range(start_row, end_row):\n                for col in range(start_col, end_col):\n                    output_grid[row][col] = value\n    \n    return output_grid\n```",
