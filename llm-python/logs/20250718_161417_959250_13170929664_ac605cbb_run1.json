          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve expanding or spreading out certain values (like 1, 2, 3, 6) into surrounding cells.\n2. The values 1, 2, 3, 6 appear to be \"inflated\" or \"expanded\" into a pattern that spreads out from their original position.\n3. The value 5 seems to be a result of some kind of expansion or propagation from the original value.\n4. The transformation appears to be a kind of \"spread\" or \"influence\" where certain values affect their neighboring cells.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading out certain values in a specific pattern, possibly using a kind of diffusion or propagation.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = np.copy(grid_np)\n    \n    # Define the values that need to be expanded\n    expand_values = [1, 2, 3, 6]\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell contains a value to be expanded\n            if grid_np[i][j] in expand_values:\n                # Spread the value to neighboring cells\n                # We'll use a simple diffusion pattern\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 10 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                            # If the neighboring cell is 0, replace it with 5\n                            if transformed_grid[ni][nj] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 5\n                            # If the neighboring cell is not 0, replace it with the original value\n                            else:\n                                transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    transformed_grid = np.copy(grid_np)\n    \n    expand_values = [1, 2, 3, 6]\n    \n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid_np[i][j] in expand_values:\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 10 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                            if transformed_grid[ni][nj] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 5\n                            else:\n                                transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
