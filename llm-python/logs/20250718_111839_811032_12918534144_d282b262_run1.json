Creating patterns based on the original values\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n- Values in the input grid are being transformed in a way that seems to involve symmetry or reflection\n- Certain patterns (like 2x2 blocks) are being transformed into other patterns\n- Values like 8 and 3 seem to be moved in a specific pattern\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n1. Looks for patterns in the input grid\n2. Applies transformations based on observed patterns\n3. Ensures the output is always a 15x15 grid\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(15):\n        for j in range(15):\n            # Check if the cell is part of a pattern that needs transformation\n            if grid[i][j] == 8 and i < 12 and j < 12:\n                # Apply a transformation pattern (example pattern based on observations)\n                # This is a simple pattern that moves values in a specific way\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 3\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 3\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3 and i < 12 and j < 12:\n                # Apply a transformation pattern (example pattern based on observations)\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 3\n                elif i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 3\n            # Additional patterns can be added here based on observations\n            # This is a simplified version based on the first example\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(15):\n        for j in range(15):\n            # Check if the cell is part of a pattern that needs transformation\n            if grid[i][j] == 8 and i < 12 and j < 12:\n                # Apply a transformation pattern (example pattern based on observations)\n                # This is a simple pattern that moves values in a specific way\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 3\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 3\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3 and i < 12 and j < 12:\n                # Apply a transformation pattern (example pattern based on observations)\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 3\n                elif i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 3\n            # Additional patterns can be added here based on observations\n            # This is a simplified version based on the first example\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
