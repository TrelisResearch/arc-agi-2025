          "Let's analyze the patterns based on observations:\n\n- Input is always a 3x3 grid with mostly 0 and 5.\n- Output is always 6x6.\n- Output uses 0,1,2 values only.\n- The centers and positions of 5 in input correspond to \"colored\" (non-zero) positions in output.\n- Output edges are black (0).\n- The non-zero positions form symmetrical patterns.\n- Colors 1 and 2 alternate in a checkerboard fashion, starting at the top-left of the colored areas.\n- The inputs seem to map each '5' in the 3x3 to a 2x2 tile in the output grid.\n- The locations of these tiles in the output grid correspond roughly to a 2x2 block mapping of the 3x3 input expanded.\n\nMore concretely:\n\n- The 3x3 input's row,column is scaled by 2, mapping position (r,c) in input to (2r,2c) in output.\n- For each cell in input:\n  - If the input cell is 5, the corresponding 2x2 square in output is filled with a 1-2 checkerboard pattern:\n    - top-left = 1\n    - top-right = 2\n    - bottom-left = 2\n    - bottom-right = 1\n- If the input cell is 0, corresponding 2x2 output cells are all 0.\n\nThis matches all training examples:\n\nExample 1: The input 5 pattern maps to checkered 2x2 blocks.\n\nExample 2: The diagonal 5's turn into 2x2 blocks positioned diagonally in output.\n\nExample 3: Mixed pattern of 5's gets 2x2 checkerboard blocks in corresponding places.\n\nThe final output grid is thus 6x6 = 3x2 by 3x2, generated by expanding each input cell to a 2x2 block with checkerboard 1,2 coloring if input=5, else 0-block.\n\n---\n\nNow let's implement this logic in code.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize 6x6 output grid with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0]*6 for _ in range(6)]\n    \n    # For each cell in 3x3 input\n    for r in range(3):\n        for c in range(3):\n            val = grid[r][c]\n            # Starting position in output grid\n            rr, cc = 2*r, 2*c\n            if val == 5:\n                # Fill 2x2 block with checkerboard pattern (1 and 2)\n                transformed_grid[rr][cc] = 1\n                transformed_grid[rr][cc+1] = 2\n                transformed_grid[rr+1][cc] = 2\n                transformed_grid[rr+1][cc+1] = 1\n            else:\n                # Fill 2x2 block with zeros (already zero, so no action needed)\n                pass\n            \n    return transformed_grid\n```"
