In Example 1, the center cell (2,2) remains the same, but the value in the center cell (2,2) is doubled (2 \u2192 4).\n2. In Example 2, the center cell (4,4) is 9, and in the output it becomes 4. This suggests that the value in the center cell is being replaced with 4.\n3. In Example 3, the center cell (2,2) is 3, and in the output it becomes 4. This suggests that the value in the center cell is being replaced with 4.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Keeping the center cell (2,2) as 4.\n- For other cells, if the value is 0, it remains 0.\n- For other cells, if the value is not 0, it remains the same.\n\nThis pattern seems to fit the training examples, although it's not completely clear. I'll implement this pattern in the transformation function.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace the center cell (2,2) with 4\n    transformed_grid[2][2] = 4\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
