In Example 1, the 5s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 2s in a specific pattern.\n3. In Example 2, the 5s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 2s in a specific pattern.\n4. In Example 3, the 5s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 2s in a specific pattern.\n5. In Example 4, the 5s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 2s in a specific pattern.\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing 5s with 2s in a specific pattern that depends on their position relative to the edges of the grid.\n\nHere's my best guess at the transformation pattern:\n- For each cell in the grid, if the cell is a 5 and it's not on the edge of the grid, replace it with 2.\n- If the cell is a 5 and it's on the edge of the grid, leave it as 5.\n\nBased on this pattern, I'll write the transformation function:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            # If the cell is a 5 and it's not on the edge of the grid, replace it with 2\n            if grid[i][j] == 5 and not (i == 0 or i == 12 or j == 0 or j == 12):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 1, the 5s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 2s in a specific pattern.\n3. In Example 2, the 5s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 2s in a specific pattern.\n4. In Example 3, the 5s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 2s in a specific pattern.\n5. In Example 4, the 5s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 2s in a specific pattern.\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing 5s with 2s in a specific pattern that depends on their position relative to the edges of the grid.\n\nHere's my best guess at the transformation pattern:\n- For each cell in the grid, if the cell is a 5 and it's not on the edge of the grid, replace it with 2.\n- If the cell is a 5 and it's on the edge of the grid, leave it as 5.\n\nBased on this pattern, I'll write the transformation function:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            # If the cell is a 5 and it's not on the edge of the grid, replace it with 2\n            if grid[i][j] == 5 and not (i == 0 or i == 12 or j == 0 or j == 12):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
