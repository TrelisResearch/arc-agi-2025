          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in the 8th row (assuming 0-based index?), and then a bunch of 5s. The output changes those 5s into 2s and 5s. Wait, looking at the input and output:\n\nInput row 2 (third row) has a 2 in column 8 (since the input is 15x15). The output for that row has a 2 in column 8, but the rest of the row is 0s except for the 9th column which is 0. Wait, maybe I should look at the actual positions.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput:\nRow 2 (third row) has a 2 in column 8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Well, the input is 15x15, so maybe 0-based. Let's check the input rows. The input's third row (row index 2) is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. Then the output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 in the input is replaced with 0s? Wait no, the output for that row is all 0s except for maybe the 9th column? Wait the output for that row is all zeros. But in the input, the third row has a 2 in column 8 (assuming 0-based, that's the 9th element). Then the output for that row is all zeros. But then in the fourth row of the input, there's a 2 in column 3, and then 5s. The output for that row has 2s in columns 3,4,5,6,7, and then 5s in columns 8-12. Wait, looking at the output for row 3 (fourth row of input) in Example 1:\n\nOutput row 3 (fourth row of input) is 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 5 5 5 0 0. So the first three columns are 0s, then columns 3-7 (indices 3 to 7) are 2s, then columns 8-12 (indices 8-12) are 5s. But in the input, that row had a 2 in column 3, then 5s from column 4 onwards. Wait, maybe the transformation is that certain regions are being replaced with other numbers based on their position.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 2 in the input's third row (row 2) is replaced with zeros. But in the fourth row of input, the 2 is in column 3, and then the output has 2s in columns 3-7. So maybe the 2 is a starting point for a region that expands to the right. But in the input, the fourth row has a 2 in column 3, followed by 5s. The output for that row has 2s in columns 3-7, then 5s in columns 8-12. So maybe the 2 is expanding to the right until it hits a 5, then the 5s are kept. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is a seed that propagates to the right, replacing adjacent cells with 2s until it hits a 5. Then the 5s are kept. But in the input, the fourth row has a 2 in column 3, then 5s from column 4 onwards. The output has 2s from column 3 to 7, then 5s from 8 to 12. So maybe the 2 is expanding to the right until it hits a 5. But how many steps? Let's see: in the input row 3 (fourth row of input), the 2 is in column 3. Then the next cells are 5s. So maybe the 2 is expanding to the right until it reaches a 5, but in the output, the 2s are spread over 5 columns (columns 3-7). So maybe the number of 2s is determined by the distance to the next 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is a starting point, and the output is replacing certain cells with 2s based on their position relative to other numbers. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 (third row) is replaced with 0s, but in the fourth row, the 2 is expanded to the right. Maybe the 2 is a boundary that defines regions. Or perhaps the 2s are replacing cells that are adjacent to a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a 3 in row 1 (second row), then 5s. The output for that row has 3s in columns 2-6, then 5s in columns 7-12. Wait, the output for row 1 in Example 2 is 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5 5 5 5 0 0. So the 3 in the input (row 1, column 2) is expanded to the right. Similarly, in Example 3, the input has a 1 in row 1, column 2. The output for that row has 1s in columns 2-6, then 4s in columns 10-13. So maybe the pattern is that when a number is present, it expands to the right until it hits a higher number. But how?\n\nWait in Example 1, the input has a 2 in row 2, column 8. The output for that row is all zeros. But in the fourth row, the input has a 2 in column 3, and the output has 2s in columns 3-7. So maybe the 2 is a seed that expands to the right, but only if there's a certain condition. Maybe the 2 is a seed that propagates to the right until it hits a higher number. But in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is replaced with 0s. So maybe that's a different case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's a certain value, it's replaced with another value based on its position. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a 1 in row 1, column 2. The output for that row has 1s in columns 2-6. Then in column 10, there's a 4. So maybe the 1 is expanding to the right until it hits a 4. Similarly, in the input, there's a 6 in row 8, column 1. The output has 6s in columns 1-4, then 5s in columns 5-8, then 4s in columns 9-12. Wait, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the output for row 8 is 0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0. The input for that row is 0 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0. So the 6 in column 1 (input) is expanded to columns 1-4 (output). Then the 5s are kept. So perhaps the 6 is expanding to the right until it hits a 5. But why does the 6 expand to 4 cells?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the minimum value in its row or column, or some other aggregate. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions. The 2s in the output seem to be replacing cells that are adjacent to a 2 in the input, but only in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's part of a certain shape or region, it's replaced with a different value. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in the input is part of a region that is replaced with 0s. But in other parts, the 2 is part of a region that is expanded.\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions of the numbers. For instance, in Example 1, the 2 in the input is in the third row, and the output for that row is all zeros. But in the fourth row, the 2 is in column 3 and expands to the right. Maybe the 2 is a seed that expands to the right, but only if there's a certain condition. For example, if the cell to the right is a 5, then the 2 is expanded to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the transformation as replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in the input, if a cell is a 2, then in the output, it's replaced with 2s in a certain region. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput row 1 (second row) is 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 0. The output for that row is 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 0. So the 1 in column 2 is expanded to the right until it hits the 5s. Then the 5s are kept. But the 4 is at the end, so the 1s are expanded until they hit the 5s, but the 4 is after the 5s. So maybe the 1 is expanding to the right until it hits a higher number (like 5 or 4). But in the output, the 1s are expanded up to column 6 (indices 2-6), then the 5s start at column 7, and the 4 is at column 13.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that for each cell, if it's a certain value (like 1, 2, 3, etc.), then in the output, it's replaced with that value for a certain number of cells to the right, until it hits a higher value. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 (third row) is replaced with 0s. But in row 3 (fourth row), the 2 is expanded to the right. Maybe that's because the 2 is in a different position.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 2 as a boundary. For instance, in Example 1, the 2 in the third row is part of a region that is replaced with 0s, but in other regions, the 2 is part of a region that is expanded. Maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in adjacent cells.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the numbers change. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is replaced with 0s, but in row 3, the 2 is expanded. Maybe the 2 is a seed that expands to the right, but only if there's a certain pattern. For example, if the cell to the right is a 5, then the 2 is expanded. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the transformation as replacing cells with the minimum value in their row or column. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's part of a certain shape (like a line or a block), it's replaced with a different value. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is part of a single cell, and it's replaced with 0s. But in row 3, the 2 is part of a line that expands to the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's a certain value, then in the output, it's replaced with a value that depends on the number of consecutive cells to the right. For example, if there's a 2 followed by 5s, then the 2 is expanded to the right for a certain number of steps.\n\nBut how to determine that number? Let's look at Example 1 again. In row 3 (fourth row of input), the 2 is in column 3, followed by 5s. The output has 2s in columns 3-7 (5 columns), then 5s. So the number of 2s is 5. But why 5? Maybe the number of 5s in the input is 5. Wait, in the input row 3, after the 2, there are 5s starting from column 4. So the 2 is in column 3, then columns 4-12 are 5s. So the number of 5s is 9 (columns 4-12). But the output has 5 columns of 2s. Maybe it's the number of steps to the right until a certain condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 2s is determined by the number of cells between the 2 and the next higher value. For example, in the input, the 2 is followed by 5s. The 5 is higher than 2, so the 2 is expanded to the right for a certain number of steps. But how many steps?\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 is in column 3. The output has 2s from column 3 to 7 (5 columns). That's 5 steps. But why 5? Maybe the number of steps is determined by the number of 5s in the input. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is expanded to the right until it hits a 5. Then, the number of 2s is the distance from the 2 to the first 5. But in the input, the 2 is in column 3, and the first 5 is in column 4. So the distance is 1. But the output has 5 columns of 2s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is expanded to the right for a certain number of steps, say 5 steps. But that would be arbitrary.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the numbers are replaced. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 3 (fourth row of input) has 2s in columns 3-7. The input for that row has 2 in column 3, and then 5s from column 4 onwards. So the 2 is expanded to the right for 5 columns. But why 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 2s is determined by the number of 5s in the input row. In the input row 3, there are 9 5s (columns 4-12). But the output has 5 2s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's a 2, then in the output, it's replaced with 2s in a certain pattern. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a 3 in row 1, column 2. The output for that row has 3s in columns 2-6. So that's 5 columns. The input row 1 has 3 followed by 5s. The output has 3s for 5 columns. So maybe the number of 3s is 5, but why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 2s or 3s is determined by the number of steps until the next higher number. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is followed by 5s. The number of 2s is 5. But that's the same as the number of 5s in the input row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is expanded to the right for a fixed number of steps, like 5 steps. But that would be arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as replacing the 2 with a block of 2s that extends to the right, but only if there's a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 (third row) is replaced with 0s. But in row 3 (fourth row), the 2 is expanded. So maybe the 2 is a seed that expands to the right if it's in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, think of the transformation as follows: for each cell, if it's a certain value (like 2, 3, etc.), then in the output, it's replaced with that value for a certain number of columns to the right, up to the first occurrence of a higher value. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is followed by 5s, so it expands to the right for 5 columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of columns the value is expanded is determined by the number of cells between the current cell and the next higher value. For example, if the current cell is a 2, and the next higher value is 5, then the 2 is expanded for as many cells as there are between the current cell and the next 5.\n\nBut in Example 1, the 2 is in column 3, and the next 5 is in column 4. So the distance is 1. But the output has 5 columns of 2s. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to all three examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a 1 in row 1, column 2. The output has 1s in columns 2-6. Then, in the next columns, there are 5s and 4s. So the 1 is expanded for 5 columns. Similarly, in Example 1, the 2 in row 3 is expanded for 5 columns. In Example 2, the 3 is expanded for 5 columns. So maybe the number of columns the value is expanded is 5. But why 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of columns is determined by the number of cells in the row. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of columns is determined by the position of the cell. For example, in the third row of Example 1, the 2 is in column 8, and the output for that row is all zeros. So maybe the expansion depends on the position in the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's a certain value (like 2, 3, 4, etc.), then it's replaced with that value for a certain number of columns to the right, up to a certain point. For example, in the first example, the 2 in row 3 is expanded to the right for 5 columns. But why 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is the number of columns the value is expanded. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is followed by 5s, and the expansion is 5 columns. So the 5 is the number of columns the value is expanded. But that's a hypothesis.\n\nSo, the pattern could be: when a cell has a value X, and the next cell to the right is a higher value Y, then X is expanded to the right for Y-1 columns. Or something like that.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 in row 3 (fourth row of input) is followed by 5s. So Y is 5. Then the number of columns the 2 is expanded is 5. But the 2 is in column 3, and the output has 2s from column 3 to 7 (5 columns). That fits. So the expansion is 5 columns.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3 in row 1 is followed by 5s. So Y is 5. The expansion is 5 columns (columns 2-6). That fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the 1 in row 1 is followed by 5s. So Y is 5. The expansion is 5 columns (columns 2-6). That fits. Then, in the same row, there's a 4 at the end. So the 1 is expanded until the 5s, and then the 4 is handled separately.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So the rule could be: for each cell, if it's a value X, and the next cell to the right is a higher value Y, then expand X to the right for Y-1 columns. But how to handle when there are multiple higher values?\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is in column 8. The next cell to the right is 0. So maybe the expansion is not done here. But in the output, that cell is replaced with 0. So perhaps the rule is that if the cell is X and the next cell is Y (higher), then expand X to the right for Y-1 columns. But if the next cell is not higher, then no expansion.\n\nBut how to handle cases where there are multiple higher values. For example, in Example 3, after the 1 is expanded, there are 5s and then a 4. So the 1 is expanded until the 5s, and then the 4 is handled. So the 4 would be expanded to the right for 4-1=3 columns?\n\nBut in the output for Example 3, the 4 is in column 13. The input for that row has a 4 in column 13. The output has 4s in columns 10-13. So the expansion is 4 columns. Which fits the Y-1 = 4-1=3? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, in the input, the 4 is in column 13. The output has 4s from column 10 to 13. That's 4 columns. So the Y is 4, and the expansion is 4 columns. But according to the hypothesis, it would be Y-1 = 3. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is Y columns. In the case of the 4, the expansion is 4 columns. So that fits. But in the previous examples, the expansion was Y columns. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is followed by 5s (Y=5), and the expansion is 5 columns (columns 3-7). So that's 5 columns. So the hypothesis is that the expansion is Y columns.\n\nBut then, for the 4 in Example 3, it's expanded for 4 columns. So that fits.\n\nSo the rule could be: for each cell, if it's X and the next cell to the right is Y (higher than X), then expand X to the right for Y columns. But how to handle if there are multiple Ys.\n\nBut how to implement this. For each cell in the grid, check if the cell is X, and the next cell is Y (higher than X). Then, for that cell, expand X to the right for Y columns.\n\nBut how to handle when the next cell is not higher. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is in column 8. The next cell is 0, which is lower. So no expansion. So that cell is replaced with 0.\n\nBut how to determine the expansion for each cell. Maybe the expansion is that the current cell's value is propagated to the right for as many columns as the next cell's value. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nSo, for each cell in the input grid, if the cell is X and the next cell to the right is Y (Y > X), then in the output, the current cell is replaced with X, and the next Y-1 cells are also replaced with X. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in the input, if the cell is X and the next cell to the right is Y (Y > X), then in the output, the current cell and the next Y-1 cells are replaced with X. But that would mean that the current cell is X, and the next Y-1 cells are also X. So total of Y cells. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is followed by 5. So Y is 5. So the current cell (2) and the next 4 cells are replaced with 2. That would be 5 cells. Which matches the example.\n\nBut in Example 3, the 1 is followed by 5. So Y is 5. The current cell is 1, and the next 4 cells are 5. So the expansion would be 5 cells (current and 4 next). But in the output, the 1 is expanded to 5 cells (columns 2-6). Which is 5 cells. That fits.\n\nFor the 4 in Example 3, it's followed by 5s. So Y is 5. But the 4 is in column 13. The next cell is 5. So the expansion would be 5 cells. But in the output, the 4 is in column 13, and the output has 4s in columns 10-13. That's 4 cells. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is Y-1 cells. So for the 4 in Example 3, the next cell is 5. Y is 5, so Y-1 is 4. So the current cell (4) is expanded for 4 cells to the right. But in the output, the 4 is in column 13, and the output has 4s in columns 10-13. That's 4 cells (columns 10, 11, 12, 13). Which is 4 cells. So that fits. So the rule is: if the current cell is X and the next cell is Y (Y > X), then expand X to the right for Y-1 cells. So the current cell and the next Y-1 cells are replaced with X. That would be Y cells total.\n\nSo for the 2 in Example 1, the next cell is 5. Y is 5, so expand for 4 cells. So the current cell is column 3, and the next 4 cells are columns 4-7. So total of 5 cells (columns 3-7). Which matches the example.\n\nIn the case of the 4 in Example 3, the next cell is 5. So expand for 4 cells. So the current cell is column 13, and the next 4 cells would be columns 14-17, but the grid is 15 columns. So that's not possible. So perhaps the expansion is limited to the grid's boundaries.\n\nSo the rule is: for each cell (i,j), if the cell is X, and the cell to the right (i,j+1) is Y, and Y > X, then in the output, the cell (i,j) and the next Y-1 cells to the right are set to X. But if there are not enough cells to the right, then only as many as possible.\n\nBut how to handle this for all cells. Also, what if there are multiple cells that need to be expanded. For example, if a cell is X, and the next cell is Y, and then the next cell is Z, which is higher than Y. How does that affect the expansion?\n\nBut perhaps this is the pattern. So the transformation is: for each cell, if the next cell to the right is a higher value, then expand the current cell's value to the right for Y-1 steps, where Y is the next cell's value.\n\nBut how to implement this. For each cell (i,j), check if j+1 is within bounds. If so, check if grid[i][j] < grid[i][j+1]. If yes, then in the output, set the current cell and the next (grid[i][j+1] - 1) cells to the same value as grid[i][j]. But if there are not enough cells, then set as many as possible.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple cells that need to be expanded. For example, if a cell is X, and the next cell is Y, which is higher than X, then the current cell is expanded for Y-1 steps. But what if the next cell is also part of an expansion?\n\nThis seems like a possible pattern. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1: the 2 in row 3 (fourth row of input) is in column 3. The next cell is 5. So Y is 5. So expand for 4 steps. So the current cell (3) and the next 4 cells (4-7) are set to 2. That gives 5 cells, which matches the output.\n\nIn the same row, the next cell after 5 is 5. So for those cells, the next cell is 5, which is not higher than 5. So no expansion. So the 5s are not expanded.\n\nExample 2: the 3 in row 1 (second row of input) is in column 2. The next cell is 5. So expand for 4 steps. So current cell and next 4 cells (columns 2-6) are 3. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 3: the 1 in row 1 is in column 2. Next cell is 5. Expand for 4 steps. So columns 2-6 are 1. Which matches the output.\n\nThe 4 in row 8 (ninth row of input) is in column 13. The next cell is 5. So expand for 4 steps. But the grid has 15 columns. So columns 13,14,15? Wait, column 13 is the 14th column (0-based). Wait, the grid is 15 columns (0-14). So column 13 is the 14th column. The next cell is column 14. So the next cell is 5. So expand for 4 steps. So current cell (13) and next 4 cells (14, 15, 16, 17). But there are only 15 columns. So only columns 13 and 14. But that's only 2 cells. But in the output, the 4 is in column 13, and the output for that row is 0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0. Wait, no, the output for that row is 0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong row.\n\nIn Example 3's input, row 8 (the ninth row) is:\n\n0 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\nThe output for that row is:\n\n0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\nSo the 6 is in column 1 (input) and the output has 6s in columns 1-4. So for the 6 in column 1, the next cell is 5. So Y is 5. Expand for 4 steps. So columns 1, 2, 3, 4. Which is 4 steps. That matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nSo the rule is: for each cell (i,j), if the cell to the right (i,j+1) is a higher value, then expand the current cell's value to the right for (next_value - 1) steps. So the current cell and the next (next_value - 1) cells are set to the current cell's value. But if there are not enough cells, then only as many as possible.\n\nBut what about cells that are not followed by a higher value. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 (third row) is in column 8. The next cell is 0. So no expansion. So the output is 0. But how to handle that. Maybe those cells are set to 0.\n\nBut what about when the next cell is not higher. For example, if the next cell is the same value, or lower. Then no expansion.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\n- If j is the last column (j == 14), then no expansion.\n\n- Else, check if grid[i][j+1] > grid[i][j].\n\n- If yes, then set the output cell (i,j) to grid[i][j], and the next (grid[i][j+1] - 1) cells to the right to grid[i][j].\n\n- If not, then set the output cell to grid[i][j], but no expansion.\n\nBut wait, what about when the next cell is higher than the current cell. For example, if the current cell is 2 and the next is 5, then expand for 4 steps. So the current cell and the next 4 cells are set to 2. That's 5 cells. So for the current cell (j), the cells from j to j + (grid[i][j+1] - 1) are set to grid[i][j].\n\nBut how to handle when the next cell is higher than the current cell, but there are other cells to the right that may also be higher.\n\nBut according to the examples, this seems to work.\n\nNow, how to implement this in code.\n\nFirst, create a 15x15 grid. Then, for each cell (i,j), check if j+1 is within bounds. Then check if grid[i][j+1] > grid[i][j]. If so, then expand the current cell's value to the right for (grid[i][j+1] - 1) steps.\n\nBut how to handle this in code. For example, for each cell (i,j), we need to set a range of cells to the same value.\n\nBut how to avoid overlapping expansions. For example, if a cell is expanded, then the next cell may also be expanded. But according to the examples, this seems to be handled correctly.\n\nBut in the code, we need to process each cell and apply the expansion. However, if we process the cells in order, from left to right, then when we expand a cell, the next cells may have their own expansions. But according to the examples, this seems to be handled.\n\nBut perhaps the expansion is only applied once per cell. For example, when processing cell (i,j), if the next cell is higher, then expand the current cell's value to the right. But if the current cell's value is already set by a previous expansion, then it's not changed again. But how to handle that.\n\nBut according to the examples, the expansion is applied based on the input grid, not the output. So the code should process the input grid and apply the expansion based on the input values, not the output.\n\nSo the code would:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid, check if the next cell is higher.\n\n- If so, then in the output grid, set the current cell and the next (next_value - 1) cells to the current cell's value.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping expansions. For example, if a cell is expanded, then the next cell may also be expanded. But according to the examples, this is handled correctly.\n\nBut in code, how to implement this. For example, for each cell (i,j):\n\nif j+1 is within 0-14:\n\n    next_val = grid[i][j+1]\n\n    if next_val > grid[i][j]:\n\n        expand_length = next_val - 1\n\n        for k in range(j, j + expand_length + 1):\n\n            if k < 15:\n\n                output[i][k] = grid[i][j]\n\nBut wait, the expand_length is next_val - 1. So the number of cells to expand is expand_length + 1 (including the current cell). Because the current cell is j, and the next cells are j+1 to j+expand_length. So the total is expand_length + 1 cells.\n\nBut in the example, when next_val is 5, expand_length is 4. So the cells from j to j+4 (5 cells). Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each row in grid:\n\n    for each column j in 0 to 14:\n\n        if j+1 < 15:\n\n            next_val = grid[i][j+1]\n\n            if next_val > grid[i][j]:\n\n                expand_length = next_val - 1\n\n                for k in range(j, j + expand_length + 1):\n\n                    if k < 15:\n\n                        output[i][k] = grid[i][j]\n\nBut wait, this would overwrite the output cells. For example, if a cell is processed, and then another cell to the right is processed, which also has a higher next value. But according to the examples, this is handled.\n\nBut what about when a cell is part of an expansion. For example, if cell (i,j) is expanded, then cell (i,j+1) may be part of an expansion. But according to the input grid, the next_val is based on the input grid, not the output. So the code is based on the input grid.\n\nSo the code would process the input grid and apply the expansion based on the input values.\n\nBut what about cells that are not part of any expansion. For example, if the next cell is not higher, then the cell is left as is.\n\nBut in the examples, some cells are set to 0. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is set to 0. But according to the code, if the next cell is not higher, then the cell is not expanded. So what happens to those cells? They are left as is. But in the output, they are set to 0. So this suggests that the code is not sufficient.\n\nWait, this is a problem. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 (third row) is in column 8. The next cell is 0. So the code would not expand it. But in the output, that cell is set to 0. So how is that handled?\n\nAh, this suggests that the code is not sufficient. So perhaps there's another part of the pattern. For example, if the cell is 2 and the next cell is 0, then the cell is set to 0. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is not only expanding based on the next cell, but also replacing cells with 0 if they are not part of any expansion.\n\nBut this complicates things. So perhaps the code is not sufficient, and there's another pattern.\n\nLooking back at Example 1's output, the third row (row 2) is all 0s. The input for that row has a 2 in column 8. But according to the code, since the next cell is 0, which is not higher, the code would leave the cell as 2. But in the output, it's 0. So this suggests that there's another rule.\n\nThis indicates that my previous hypothesis is incomplete. So I need to think again.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 2 is all zeros. But the input for that row has a 2 in column 8. So perhaps the 2 is replaced with 0s. But why?\n\nMaybe the rule is that if a cell is not part of any expansion, it is set to 0. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is part of a region that is surrounded by 0s, and thus is replaced with 0s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it is not part of any expansion, then it is replaced with 0. But how to determine that.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are not part of any expansion. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is not part of any expansion, so it is replaced with 0. But other cells may also be replaced with 0.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. How to determine which cells to replace with 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should set all cells to 0, and then apply the expansion rules. But that would not fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should replace cells with 0 if they are not part of any expansion. But how to determine that.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look for other patterns.\n\nIn Example 3, the output for row 8 has 6s in columns 1-4. The input for that row has 6 in column 1, followed by 5s. So the expansion is based on the next cell being 5, which is higher than 6? No, 5 is lower than 6. So this contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nWait, this is a problem. In Example 3's input, the row is:\n\n0 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\nSo for cell (i,j) = (8,1), the next cell is 5, which is less than 6. So according to the previous hypothesis, there should be no expansion. But in the output, the 6 is expanded to columns 1-4. So this contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nThis indicates that the previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nSo what's the correct pattern?\n\nLooking at Example 3's output for row 8:\n\n0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\nThe input for that row is:\n\n0 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\nSo the 6 in column 1 is followed by 5s. But the output has 6s in columns 1-4. So how is that possible? The previous hypothesis said that the expansion is only when the next cell is higher. But in this case, the next cell is lower. So the previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is different.\n\nSo what is the correct pattern?\n\nLet me think again. In Example 3, the 6 in column 1 is followed by 5s. The output has 6s in columns 1-4. So the expansion is to the right, even though the next cell is lower. So the previous hypothesis is wrong.\n\nSo what's the pattern here?\n\nMaybe the expansion is based on the next cell being lower, and the current cell is expanded to the right until it hits a lower value. Or maybe it's based on the next cell being lower, and the current cell is expanded to the right for a certain number of steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is based on the next cell being a certain value. For example, if the current cell is X, and the next cell is Y, then expand X to the right for Y steps. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is based on the current cell's value being a seed, and the expansion continues to the right until it hits a cell with a value that is not equal to the current cell's value.\n\nBut in Example 3, the 6 is followed by 5s, so the expansion stops at the first 5. So the 6 is expanded for 4 cells (columns 1-4). But why 4?\n\nThis suggests that the expansion is based on the number of steps until the first different value.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nFor example, in Example 3's row 8:\n\nThe current cell is 6, next is 5. So the expansion stops at the first 5. So the 6 is expanded for 1 step (column 1). But the output has 6s in columns 1-4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is based on the number of consecutive cells with the same value. For example, if the current cell is 6, and the next cell is 5, then the expansion is 1 cell. But this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, it seems that certain values are replaced with other values based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in the third row is replaced with 0s, but in the fourth row, the 2 is expanded. This suggests that the expansion depends on the position of the cell in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it is a certain value, it is replaced with a value based on its row and column.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the third row (row index 2) has a 2 in column 8. The output for that row is all zeros. But in the fourth row (row index 3), the 2 is expanded to the right. So maybe the expansion depends on the row.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of the examples and see if there's a pattern in the positions of the numbers.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for row 3 (fourth row of input) has 2s in columns 3-7. This is the same as the input's 2 in column 3, and then 5s. So maybe the 2 is expanded to the right until it hits a 5.\n\nBut in Example 3, the 6 is expanded to the right even though the next cell is 5. So this suggests that the expansion is based on the current cell's value being higher than the next cell.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the 6 is higher than the next cell (5). So the expansion is to the right for as many steps as possible until the next cell is lower. So the expansion is to the right until it hits a lower value.\n\nBut how to determine the number of steps.\n\nIn Example 3, the 6 is in column 1. The next cell is 5 (lower). So the expansion is for 1 step (column 1). But the output has 6s in columns 1-4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is to the right until it hits a cell with a value lower than the current cell. So for the 6 in column 1, the next cell is 5, which is lower. So the expansion is for 1 step. But the output has 4 steps. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is to the right until it hits a cell with a value higher than the current cell. But in this case, the next cell is 5, which is lower, so the expansion continues until the end of the row.\n\nBut this would mean that the 6 is expanded to the right for all cells until the end of the row, which is not the case.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output, the 6 in column 1 is expanded to columns 1-4, and then the 5s are kept. So the 6 is expanded for 4 columns. Why 4?\n\nMaybe it's the number of consecutive 5s to the right. In the input row, there are 12 5s starting from column 2. But why 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is based on the number of cells to the right until a certain condition. For example, in Example 3, the 6 is expanded for 4 steps, which is the same as the number of 5s in the input row. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is based on the number of steps until the first occurrence of a certain value. For example, in Example 3, the 6 is expanded for 4 steps until it hits a 5, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, there's a pattern where certain values are replaced with other values in a way that forms a block. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in the fourth row is expanded to the right, forming a block of 2s, and the 5s are kept. In Example 3, the 6 is expanded to the right, forming a block of 6s, and then the 5s are kept.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is to replace certain cells with a block of their value, extending to the right until a certain condition is met.\n\nBut what is the condition?\n\nMaybe the condition is that the next cell is a certain value. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is followed by 5s, and the 2 is expanded to the right until it hits a 5. In Example 3, the 6 is followed by 5s, and the 6 is expanded to the right until it hits a 5. But how to determine the number of steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is to the right until it hits a cell with a value that is not equal to the current cell's value. For example, in Example 3, the 6 is followed by 5, so the expansion is for 1 step (column 1). But the output has 4 steps. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the 6 is in column 1, and the output has 6s in columns 1-4. The input for that row has 6 in column 1, followed by 5s. So the 6 is expanded to the right for 4 steps. Why 4?\n\nMaybe it's the number of steps until the first occurrence of a 5. But in this case, the first occurrence is column 2. So the expansion is for 1 step. But the output has 4 steps.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the transformation as a series of steps. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 3 is expanded to the right, but the 2 in row 2 is replaced with 0. Maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell in the grid.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is in column 8, and the output is 0. But in row 3, the 2 is in column 3, and it is expanded. So maybe the transformation depends on the row number and column number.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that if the cell is a 2, it is expanded to the right if it is in a certain row. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is in a row that is not expanded, but the 2 in row 3 is expanded.\n\nBut this is too arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to replace each cell with the minimum value in its row. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace each cell with the value of the first cell to the left that is higher than it. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace each cell with the value of the first cell to the right that is higher than it. But this is also a guess.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern from the examples. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see.\n\nBased on the earlier examples where the expansion is to the right when the next cell is higher, and the 6 in Example 3 is expanded to the right even though the next cell is lower, I think there must be another pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the 6 is in column 1, and the output has 6s in columns 1-4. The input for that row has 6 in column 1, followed by 5s. So the 6 is expanded to the right for 4 columns, which is the number of 5s in the input row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is to the right for a fixed number of steps, like 5 steps. But this is arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis, even though it doesn't fit all cases, and see if it can be implemented.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]\n    for i in range(15):\n        for j in range(15):\n            if j + 1 < 15:\n                next_val = grid[i][j+1]\n                if next_val > grid[i][j]:\n                    expand_length = next_val - 1\n                    for k in range(j, j + expand_length + 1):\n                        if k < 15:\n                            transformed[i][k] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle the case where the next_val is lower, like in Example 3. But perhaps in the test input, the pattern is different.\n\nBut according to the test input, let's see.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 1 0\nRow 2: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 3: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 4: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 1\nRow 5: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 6: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 7: 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 8: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3\nRow 9: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 10: 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 11: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 12: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 13: 0 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 0\nRow 14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 3 0 0 0\n\nNow, according to the code, let's see what happens in row 7 (row index 7), which has 6 in column 1. The next cell is 5, which is lower. So the code would not expand. But in the output, the 6 is expanded to columns 1-4. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the examples, this is a valid case. So the code is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see. Perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it is a certain value, it is expanded to the right for a fixed number of steps, like 5 steps. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should replace cells with the value of the first cell to the right that is higher, and expand to the right until that cell.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the code that handles the examples where the next cell is higher, and see if it passes the examples.\n\nBut in Example 3, the code would not handle the 6 in column 1, because the next cell is 5, which is lower. So the code would not expand it. But in the output, it is expanded. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the code should expand when the next cell is lower. For example, if the next cell is lower, then expand to the right for a certain number of steps.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should expand to the right for a fixed number of steps, like 5 steps.\n\nBut this is arbitrary.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the code that handles the examples where the next cell is higher, and hope that it passes the test cases.\n\nBut this is not a correct solution, but it's the best I can do under the time constraints.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in the 8th row (assuming 0-based index?), and then a bunch of 5s. The output changes those 5s into 2s and 5s. Wait, looking at the input and output:\n\nInput row 2 (third row) has a 2 in column 8 (since the input is 15x15). The output for that row has a 2 in column 8, but the rest of the row is 0s except for the 9th column which is 0. Wait, maybe I should look at the actual positions.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput:\nRow 2 (third row) has a 2 in column 8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Well, the input is 15x15, so maybe 0-based. Let's check the input rows. The input's third row (row index 2) is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. Then the output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 in the input is replaced with 0s? Wait no, the output for that row is all 0s except for maybe the 9th column? Wait the output for that row is all zeros. But in the input, the third row has a 2 in column 8 (assuming 0-based, that's the 9th element). Then the output for that row is all zeros. But then in the fourth row of the input, there's a 2 in column 3, and then 5s. The output for that row has 2s in columns 3,4,5,6,7, and then 5s in columns 8-12. Wait, looking at the output for row 3 (fourth row of input) in Example 1:\n\nOutput row 3 (fourth row of input) is 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 5 5 5 0 0. So the first three columns are 0s, then columns 3-7 (indices 3 to 7) are 2s, then columns 8-12 (indices 8-12) are 5s. But in the input, that row had a 2 in column 3, then 5s from column 4 onwards. Wait, maybe the transformation is that certain regions are being replaced with other numbers based on their position.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 2 in the input's third row (row 2) is replaced with zeros. But in the fourth row of input, the 2 is in column 3, and then the output has 2s in columns 3-7. So maybe the 2 is a starting point for a region that expands to the right. But in the input, the fourth row has a 2 in column 3, followed by 5s. The output for that row has 2s in columns 3-7, then 5s in columns 8-12. So maybe the 2 is expanding to the right until it hits a 5, then the 5s are kept. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is a seed that propagates to the right, replacing adjacent cells with 2s until it hits a 5. Then the 5s are kept. But in the input, the fourth row has a 2 in column 3, then 5s from column 4 onwards. The output has 2s from column 3 to 7, then 5s from 8 to 12. So maybe the 2 is expanding to the right until it hits a 5. But how many steps? Let's see: in the input row 3 (fourth row of input), the 2 is in column 3. Then the next cells are 5s. So maybe the 2 is expanding to the right until it reaches a 5, but in the output, the 2s are spread over 5 columns (columns 3-7). So maybe the number of 2s is determined by the distance to the next 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is a starting point, and the output is replacing certain cells with 2s based on their position relative to other numbers. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 (third row) is replaced with 0s, but in the fourth row, the 2 is expanded to the right. Maybe the 2 is a boundary that defines regions. Or perhaps the 2s are replacing cells that are adjacent to a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a 3 in row 1 (second row), then 5s. The output for that row has 3s in columns 2-6, then 5s in columns 7-12. Wait, the output for row 1 in Example 2 is 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5 5 5 5 0 0. So the 3 in the input (row 1, column 2) is expanded to the right. Similarly, in Example 3, the input has a 1 in row 1, column 2. The output for that row has 1s in columns 2-6, then 4s in columns 10-13. So maybe the pattern is that when a number is present, it expands to the right until it hits a higher number. But how?\n\nWait in Example 1, the input has a 2 in row 2, column 8. The output for that row is all zeros. But in the fourth row, the input has a 2 in column 3, and the output has 2s in columns 3-7. So maybe the 2 is a seed that expands to the right, but only if there's a certain condition. Maybe the 2 is a seed that propagates to the right until it hits a higher number. But in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is replaced with 0s. So maybe that's a different case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's a certain value, it's replaced with another value based on its position. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a 1 in row 1, column 2. The output for that row has 1s in columns 2-6. Then in column 10, there's a 4. So maybe the 1 is expanding to the right until it hits a 4. Similarly, in the input, there's a 6 in row 8, column 1. The output has 6s in columns 1-4, then 5s in columns 5-8, then 4s in columns 9-12. Wait, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the output for row 8 is 0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0. The input for that row is 0 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0. So the 6 in column 1 (input) is expanded to columns 1-4 (output). Then the 5s are kept. So perhaps the 6 is expanding to the right until it hits a 5. But why does the 6 expand to 4 cells?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each cell is replaced with the minimum value in its row or column, or some other aggregate. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions. The 2s in the output seem to be replacing cells that are adjacent to a 2 in the input, but only in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's part of a certain shape or region, it's replaced with a different value. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in the input is part of a region that is replaced with 0s. But in other parts, the 2 is part of a region that is expanded.\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions of the numbers. For instance, in Example 1, the 2 in the input is in the third row, and the output for that row is all zeros. But in the fourth row, the 2 is in column 3 and expands to the right. Maybe the 2 is a seed that expands to the right, but only if there's a certain condition. For example, if the cell to the right is a 5, then the 2 is expanded to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the transformation as replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in the input, if a cell is a 2, then in the output, it's replaced with 2s in a certain region. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput row 1 (second row) is 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 0. The output for that row is 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 0. So the 1 in column 2 is expanded to the right until it hits the 5s. Then the 5s are kept. But the 4 is at the end, so the 1s are expanded until they hit the 5s, but the 4 is after the 5s. So maybe the 1 is expanding to the right until it hits a higher number (like 5 or 4). But in the output, the 1s are expanded up to column 6 (indices 2-6), then the 5s start at column 7, and the 4 is at column 13.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that for each cell, if it's a certain value (like 1, 2, 3, etc.), then in the output, it's replaced with that value for a certain number of cells to the right, until it hits a higher value. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 (third row) is replaced with 0s. But in row 3 (fourth row), the 2 is expanded to the right. Maybe that's because the 2 is in a different position.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 2 as a boundary. For instance, in Example 1, the 2 in the third row is part of a region that is replaced with 0s, but in other regions, the 2 is part of a region that is expanded. Maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in adjacent cells.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the numbers change. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is replaced with 0s, but in row 3, the 2 is expanded. Maybe the 2 is a seed that expands to the right, but only if there's a certain pattern. For example, if the cell to the right is a 5, then the 2 is expanded. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the transformation as replacing cells with the minimum value in their row or column. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's part of a certain shape (like a line or a block), it's replaced with a different value. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is part of a single cell, and it's replaced with 0s. But in row 3, the 2 is part of a line that expands to the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's a certain value, then in the output, it's replaced with a value that depends on the number of consecutive cells to the right. For example, if there's a 2 followed by 5s, then the 2 is expanded to the right for a certain number of steps.\n\nBut how to determine that number? Let's look at Example 1 again. In row 3 (fourth row of input), the 2 is in column 3, followed by 5s. The output has 2s in columns 3-7 (5 columns), then 5s. So the number of 2s is 5. But why 5? Maybe the number of 5s in the input is 5. Wait, in the input row 3, after the 2, there are 5s starting from column 4. So the 2 is in column 3, then columns 4-12 are 5s. So the number of 5s is 9 (columns 4-12). But the output has 5 columns of 2s. Maybe it's the number of steps to the right until a certain condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 2s is determined by the number of cells between the 2 and the next higher value. For example, in the input, the 2 is followed by 5s. The 5 is higher than 2, so the 2 is expanded to the right for a certain number of steps. But how many steps?\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 is in column 3. The output has 2s from column 3 to 7 (5 columns). That's 5 steps. But why 5? Maybe the number of steps is determined by the number of 5s in the input. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is expanded to the right until it hits a 5. Then, the number of 2s is the distance from the 2 to the first 5. But in the input, the 2 is in column 3, and the first 5 is in column 4. So the distance is 1. But the output has 5 columns of 2s. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is expanded to the right for a certain number of steps, say 5 steps. But that would be arbitrary.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the numbers are replaced. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 3 (fourth row of input) has 2s in columns 3-7. The input for that row has 2 in column 3, and then 5s from column 4 onwards. So the 2 is expanded to the right for 5 columns. But why 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 2s is determined by the number of 5s in the input row. In the input row 3, there are 9 5s (columns 4-12). But the output has 5 2s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's a 2, then in the output, it's replaced with 2s in a certain pattern. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a 3 in row 1, column 2. The output for that row has 3s in columns 2-6. So that's 5 columns. The input row 1 has 3 followed by 5s. The output has 3s for 5 columns. So maybe the number of 3s is 5, but why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 2s or 3s is determined by the number of steps until the next higher number. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is followed by 5s. The number of 2s is 5. But that's the same as the number of 5s in the input row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is expanded to the right for a fixed number of steps, like 5 steps. But that would be arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as replacing the 2 with a block of 2s that extends to the right, but only if there's a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 (third row) is replaced with 0s. But in row 3 (fourth row), the 2 is expanded. So maybe the 2 is a seed that expands to the right if it's in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, think of the transformation as follows: for each cell, if it's a certain value (like 2, 3, etc.), then in the output, it's replaced with that value for a certain number of columns to the right, up to the first occurrence of a higher value. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is followed by 5s, so it expands to the right for 5 columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of columns the value is expanded is determined by the number of cells between the current cell and the next higher value. For example, if the current cell is a 2, and the next higher value is 5, then the 2 is expanded for as many cells as there are between the current cell and the next 5.\n\nBut in Example 1, the 2 is in column 3, and the next 5 is in column 4. So the distance is 1. But the output has 5 columns of 2s. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to all three examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a 1 in row 1, column 2. The output has 1s in columns 2-6. Then, in the next columns, there are 5s and 4s. So the 1 is expanded for 5 columns. Similarly, in Example 1, the 2 in row 3 is expanded for 5 columns. In Example 2, the 3 is expanded for 5 columns. So maybe the number of columns the value is expanded is 5. But why 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of columns is determined by the number of cells in the row. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of columns is determined by the position of the cell. For example, in the third row of Example 1, the 2 is in column 8, and the output for that row is all zeros. So maybe the expansion depends on the position in the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's a certain value (like 2, 3, 4, etc.), then it's replaced with that value for a certain number of columns to the right, up to a certain point. For example, in the first example, the 2 in row 3 is expanded to the right for 5 columns. But why 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is the number of columns the value is expanded. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is followed by 5s, and the expansion is 5 columns. So the 5 is the number of columns the value is expanded. But that's a hypothesis.\n\nSo, the pattern could be: when a cell has a value X, and the next cell to the right is a higher value Y, then X is expanded to the right for Y-1 columns. Or something like that.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 in row 3 (fourth row of input) is followed by 5s. So Y is 5. Then the number of columns the 2 is expanded is 5. But the 2 is in column 3, and the output has 2s from column 3 to 7 (5 columns). That fits. So the expansion is 5 columns.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3 in row 1 is followed by 5s. So Y is 5. The expansion is 5 columns (columns 2-6). That fits.\n\nIn Example 3, the 1 in row 1 is followed by 5s. So Y is 5. The expansion is 5 columns (columns 2-6). That fits. Then, in the same row, there's a 4 at the end. So the 1 is expanded until the 5s, and then the 4 is handled separately.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So the rule could be: for each cell, if it's a value X, and the next cell to the right is a higher value Y, then expand X to the right for Y-1 columns. But how to handle when there are multiple higher values?\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is in column 8. The next cell to the right is 0. So maybe the expansion is not done here. But in the output, that cell is replaced with 0. So perhaps the rule is that if the cell is X and the next cell is Y (higher), then expand X to the right for Y-1 columns. But if the next cell is not higher, then no expansion.\n\nBut how to handle cases where there are multiple higher values. For example, in Example 3, after the 1 is expanded, there are 5s and then a 4. So the 1 is expanded until the 5s, and then the 4 is handled. So the 4 would be expanded to the right for 4-1=3 columns?\n\nBut in the output for Example 3, the 4 is in column 13. The input for that row has a 4 in column 13. The output has 4s in columns 10-13. So the expansion is 4 columns. Which fits the Y-1 = 4-1=3? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, in the input, the 4 is in column 13. The output has 4s from column 10 to 13. That's 4 columns. So the Y is 4, and the expansion is 4 columns. But according to the hypothesis, it would be Y-1 = 3. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is Y columns. In the case of the 4, the expansion is 4 columns. So that fits. But in the previous examples, the expansion was Y columns. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is followed by 5s (Y=5), and the expansion is 5 columns (columns 3-7). So that's 5 columns. So the hypothesis is that the expansion is Y columns.\n\nBut then, for the 4 in Example 3, it's expanded for 4 columns. So that fits.\n\nSo the rule could be: for each cell, if it's X and the next cell to the right is Y (higher than X), then expand X to the right for Y columns. But how to handle if there are multiple Ys.\n\nBut how to implement this. For each cell in the grid, check if the cell is X, and the next cell is Y (higher than X). Then, for that cell, expand X to the right for Y columns.\n\nBut how to handle when the next cell is not higher. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is in column 8. The next cell is 0, which is lower. So no expansion. So that cell is replaced with 0.\n\nBut how to determine the expansion for each cell. Maybe the expansion is that the current cell's value is propagated to the right for as many columns as the next cell's value. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nSo, for each cell in the input grid, if the cell is X and the next cell to the right is Y (Y > X), then in the output, the current cell is replaced with X, and the next Y-1 cells are also replaced with X. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in the input, if the cell is X and the next cell to the right is Y (Y > X), then in the output, the current cell and the next Y-1 cells are replaced with X. But that would mean that the current cell is X, and the next Y-1 cells are also X. So total of Y cells. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is followed by 5. So Y is 5. So the current cell (2) and the next 4 cells are replaced with 2. That would be 5 cells. Which matches the example.\n\nBut in Example 3, the 1 is followed by 5. So Y is 5. The current cell is 1, and the next 4 cells are 5. So the expansion would be 5 cells (current and 4 next). But in the output, the 1 is expanded to 5 cells (columns 2-6). Which is 5 cells. That fits.\n\nFor the 4 in Example 3, it's followed by 5s. So Y is 5. But the 4 is in column 13. The next cell is 5. So the expansion would be 5 cells. But in the output, the 4 is in column 13, and the output has 4s in columns 10-13. That's 4 cells. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is Y-1 cells. So for the 4 in Example 3, the next cell is 5. Y is 5, so Y-1 is 4. So the current cell (4) is expanded for 4 cells to the right. But in the output, the 4 is in column 13, and the output has 4s in columns 10-13. That's 4 cells (columns 10, 11, 12, 13). Which is 4 cells. So that fits. So the rule is: if the current cell is X and the next cell is Y (Y > X), then expand X to the right for Y-1 cells. So the current cell and the next Y-1 cells are replaced with X. That would be Y cells total.\n\nSo for the 2 in Example 1, the next cell is 5. Y is 5, so expand for 4 cells. So the current cell is column 3, and the next 4 cells are columns 4-7. So total of 5 cells (columns 3-7). Which matches the example.\n\nIn the case of the 4 in Example 3, the next cell is 5. So expand for 4 cells. So the current cell is column 13, and the next 4 cells would be columns 14-17, but the grid is 15 columns. So that's not possible. So perhaps the expansion is limited to the grid's boundaries.\n\nSo the rule is: for each cell (i,j), if the cell is X, and the cell to the right (i,j+1) is Y, and Y > X, then in the output, the cell (i,j) and the next Y-1 cells to the right are set to X. But if there are not enough cells to the right, then only as many as possible.\n\nBut how to handle this for all cells. Also, what if there are multiple cells that need to be expanded. For example, if a cell is X, and the next cell is Y, and then the next cell is Z, which is higher than Y. How does that affect the expansion?\n\nBut perhaps this is the pattern. So the transformation is: for each cell, if the next cell to the right is a higher value, then expand the current cell's value to the right for Y-1 steps, where Y is the next cell's value.\n\nBut how to implement this. For each cell (i,j), check if j+1 is within bounds. If so, check if grid[i][j] < grid[i][j+1]. If yes, then in the output, set the current cell and the next (grid[i][j+1] - 1) cells to the same value as grid[i][j]. But if there are not enough cells, then set as many as possible.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple cells that need to be expanded. For example, if a cell is X, and the next cell is Y, which is higher than X, then the current cell is expanded for Y-1 steps. But what if the next cell is also part of an expansion?\n\nThis seems like a possible pattern. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1: the 2 in row 3 (fourth row of input) is in column 3. The next cell is 5. So Y is 5. So expand for 4 steps. So the current cell (3) and the next 4 cells (4-7) are set to 2. That gives 5 cells, which matches the output.\n\nIn the same row, the next cell after 5 is 5. So for those cells, the next cell is 5, which is not higher than 5. So no expansion. So the 5s are not expanded.\n\nExample 2: the 3 in row 1 (second row of input) is in column 2. The next cell is 5. So expand for 4 steps. So current cell and next 4 cells (columns 2-6) are 3. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 3: the 1 in row 1 is in column 2. Next cell is 5. Expand for 4 steps. So columns 2-6 are 1. Which matches the output.\n\nThe 4 in row 8 (ninth row of input) is in column 13. The next cell is 5. So expand for 4 steps. But the grid has 15 columns. So columns 13,14,15? Wait, column 13 is the 14th column (0-based). Wait, the grid is 15 columns (0-14). So column 13 is the 14th column. The next cell is column 14. So the next cell is 5. So expand for 4 steps. So current cell (13) and next 4 cells (14, 15, 16, 17). But there are only 15 columns. So only columns 13 and 14. But that's only 2 cells. But in the output, the 4 is in column 13, and the output for that row is 0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0. Wait, no, the output for that row is 0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong row.\n\nIn Example 3's input, row 8 (the ninth row) is:\n\n0 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\nThe output for that row is:\n\n0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\nSo the 6 is in column 1 (input) and the output has 6s in columns 1-4. So for the 6 in column 1, the next cell is 5. So Y is 5. Expand for 4 steps. So columns 1, 2, 3, 4. Which is 4 steps. That matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nSo the rule is: for each cell (i,j), if the cell to the right (i,j+1) is a higher value, then expand the current cell's value to the right for (next_value - 1) steps. So the current cell and the next (next_value - 1) cells are set to the current cell's value. But if there are not enough cells, then only as many as possible.\n\nBut what about cells that are not followed by a higher value. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 (third row) is in column 8. The next cell is 0. So no expansion. So the output is 0. But how to handle that. Maybe those cells are set to 0.\n\nBut what about when the next cell is not higher. For example, if the next cell is the same value, or lower. Then no expansion.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\n- If j is the last column (j == 14), then no expansion.\n\n- Else, check if grid[i][j+1] > grid[i][j].\n\n- If yes, then set the output cell (i,j) to grid[i][j], and the next (grid[i][j+1] - 1) cells to the right to grid[i][j].\n\n- If not, then set the output cell to grid[i][j], but no expansion.\n\nBut wait, what about when the next cell is higher than the current cell. For example, if the current cell is 2 and the next is 5, then expand for 4 steps. So the current cell and the next 4 cells are set to 2. That's 5 cells. So for the current cell (j), the cells from j to j + (grid[i][j+1] - 1) are set to grid[i][j].\n\nBut how to handle when the next cell is higher than the current cell, but there are other cells to the right that may also be higher.\n\nBut according to the examples, this seems to work.\n\nNow, how to implement this in code.\n\nFirst, create a 15x15 grid. Then, for each cell (i,j), check if j+1 is within bounds. Then check if grid[i][j+1] > grid[i][j]. If so, then expand the current cell's value to the right for (grid[i][j+1] - 1) steps.\n\nBut how to handle this in code. For example, for each cell (i,j), we need to set a range of cells to the same value.\n\nBut how to avoid overlapping expansions. For example, if a cell is expanded, then the next cell may also be expanded. But according to the examples, this seems to be handled correctly.\n\nBut in the code, we need to process each cell and apply the expansion. However, if we process the cells in order, from left to right, then when we expand a cell, the next cells may have their own expansions. But according to the examples, this seems to be handled.\n\nBut perhaps the expansion is only applied once per cell. For example, when processing cell (i,j), if the next cell is higher, then expand the current cell's value to the right. But if the current cell's value is already set by a previous expansion, then it's not changed again. But how to handle that.\n\nBut according to the examples, the expansion is applied based on the input grid, not the output. So the code should process the input grid and apply the expansion based on the input values, not the output.\n\nSo the code would:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid, check if the next cell is higher.\n\n- If so, then in the output grid, set the current cell and the next (next_value - 1) cells to the current cell's value.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping expansions. For example, if a cell is expanded, then the next cell may also be expanded. But according to the examples, this is handled correctly.\n\nBut in code, how to implement this. For example, for each cell (i,j):\n\nif j+1 is within 0-14:\n\n    next_val = grid[i][j+1]\n\n    if next_val > grid[i][j]:\n\n        expand_length = next_val - 1\n\n        for k in range(j, j + expand_length + 1):\n\n            if k < 15:\n\n                output[i][k] = grid[i][j]\n\nBut wait, the expand_length is next_val - 1. So the number of cells to expand is expand_length + 1 (including the current cell). Because the current cell is j, and the next cells are j+1 to j+expand_length. So the total is expand_length + 1 cells.\n\nBut in the example, when next_val is 5, expand_length is 4. So the cells from j to j+4 (5 cells). Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each row in grid:\n\n    for each column j in 0 to 14:\n\n        if j+1 < 15:\n\n            next_val = grid[i][j+1]\n\n            if next_val > grid[i][j]:\n\n                expand_length = next_val - 1\n\n                for k in range(j, j + expand_length + 1):\n\n                    if k < 15:\n\n                        output[i][k] = grid[i][j]\n\nBut wait, this would overwrite the output cells. For example, if a cell is processed, and then another cell to the right is processed, which also has a higher next value. But according to the examples, this is handled.\n\nBut what about when a cell is part of an expansion. For example, if cell (i,j) is expanded, then cell (i,j+1) may be part of an expansion. But according to the input grid, the next_val is based on the input grid, not the output. So the code is based on the input grid.\n\nSo the code would process the input grid and apply the expansion based on the input values.\n\nBut what about cells that are not part of any expansion. For example, if the next cell is not higher, then the cell is left as is.\n\nBut in the examples, some cells are set to 0. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is set to 0. But according to the code, if the next cell is not higher, then the cell is not expanded. So what happens to those cells? They are left as is. But in the output, they are set to 0. So this suggests that the code is not sufficient.\n\nWait, this is a problem. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 (third row) is in column 8. The next cell is 0. So the code would not expand it. But in the output, that cell is set to 0. So how is that handled?\n\nAh, this suggests that the code is not sufficient. So perhaps there's another part of the pattern. For example, if the cell is 2 and the next cell is 0, then the cell is set to 0. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is not only expanding based on the next cell, but also replacing cells with 0 if they are not part of any expansion.\n\nBut this complicates things. So perhaps the code is not sufficient, and there's another pattern.\n\nLooking back at Example 1's output, the third row (row 2) is all 0s. The input for that row has a 2 in column 8. But according to the code, since the next cell is 0, which is not higher, the code would leave the cell as 2. But in the output, it's 0. So this suggests that there's another rule.\n\nThis indicates that my previous hypothesis is incomplete. So I need to think again.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 2 is all zeros. But the input for that row has a 2 in column 8. So perhaps the 2 is replaced with 0s. But why?\n\nMaybe the rule is that if a cell is not part of any expansion, it is set to 0. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is part of a region that is surrounded by 0s, and thus is replaced with 0s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it is not part of any expansion, then it is replaced with 0. But how to determine that.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are not part of any expansion. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is not part of any expansion, so it is replaced with 0. But other cells may also be replaced with 0.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. How to determine which cells to replace with 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should set all cells to 0, and then apply the expansion rules. But that would not fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should replace cells with 0 if they are not part of any expansion. But how to determine that.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look for other patterns.\n\nIn Example 3, the output for row 8 has 6s in columns 1-4. The input for that row has 6 in column 1, followed by 5s. So the expansion is based on the next cell being 5, which is higher than 6? No, 5 is lower than 6. So this contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nWait, this is a problem. In Example 3's input, the row is:\n\n0 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\nSo for cell (i,j) = (8,1), the next cell is 5, which is less than 6. So according to the previous hypothesis, there should be no expansion. But in the output, the 6 is expanded to columns 1-4. So this contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nThis indicates that the previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nSo what's the correct pattern?\n\nLooking at Example 3's output for row 8:\n\n0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\nThe input for that row is:\n\n0 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\nSo the 6 in column 1 is followed by 5s. But the output has 6s in columns 1-4. So how is that possible? The previous hypothesis said that the expansion is only when the next cell is higher. But in this case, the next cell is lower. So the previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is different.\n\nSo what is the correct pattern?\n\nLet me think again. In Example 3, the 6 in column 1 is followed by 5s. The output has 6s in columns 1-4. So the expansion is to the right, even though the next cell is lower. So the previous hypothesis is wrong.\n\nSo what's the pattern here?\n\nMaybe the expansion is based on the next cell being lower, and the current cell is expanded to the right until it hits a lower value. Or maybe it's based on the next cell being lower, and the current cell is expanded to the right for a certain number of steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is based on the next cell being a certain value. For example, if the current cell is X, and the next cell is Y, then expand X to the right for Y steps. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is based on the current cell's value being a seed, and the expansion continues to the right until it hits a cell with a value that is not equal to the current cell's value.\n\nBut in Example 3, the 6 is followed by 5s, so the expansion stops at the first 5. So the 6 is expanded for 4 cells (columns 1-4). But why 4?\n\nThis suggests that the expansion is based on the number of steps until the first different value.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nFor example, in Example 3's row 8:\n\nThe current cell is 6, next is 5. So the expansion stops at the first 5. So the 6 is expanded for 1 step (column 1). But the output has 6s in columns 1-4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is based on the number of consecutive cells with the same value. For example, if the current cell is 6, and the next cell is 5, then the expansion is 1 cell. But this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, it seems that certain values are replaced with other values based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in the third row is replaced with 0s, but in the fourth row, the 2 is expanded. This suggests that the expansion depends on the position of the cell in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it is a certain value, it is replaced with a value based on its row and column.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the third row (row index 2) has a 2 in column 8. The output for that row is all zeros. But in the fourth row (row index 3), the 2 is expanded to the right. So maybe the expansion depends on the row.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of the examples and see if there's a pattern in the positions of the numbers.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for row 3 (fourth row of input) has 2s in columns 3-7. This is the same as the input's 2 in column 3, and then 5s. So maybe the 2 is expanded to the right until it hits a 5.\n\nBut in Example 3, the 6 is expanded to the right even though the next cell is 5. So this suggests that the expansion is based on the current cell's value being higher than the next cell.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the 6 is higher than the next cell (5). So the expansion is to the right for as many steps as possible until the next cell is lower. So the expansion is to the right until it hits a lower value.\n\nBut how to determine the number of steps.\n\nIn Example 3, the 6 is in column 1. The next cell is 5 (lower). So the expansion is for 1 step (column 1). But the output has 6s in columns 1-4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is to the right until it hits a cell with a value lower than the current cell. So for the 6 in column 1, the next cell is 5, which is lower. So the expansion is for 1 step. But the output has 4 steps. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is to the right until it hits a cell with a value higher than the current cell. But in this case, the next cell is 5, which is lower, so the expansion continues until the end of the row.\n\nBut this would mean that the 6 is expanded to the right for all cells until the end of the row, which is not the case.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output, the 6 in column 1 is expanded to columns 1-4, and then the 5s are kept. So the 6 is expanded for 4 columns. Why 4?\n\nMaybe it's the number of consecutive 5s to the right. In the input row, there are 12 5s starting from column 2. But why 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is based on the number of cells to the right until a certain condition. For example, in Example 3, the 6 is expanded for 4 steps, which is the same as the number of 5s in the input row. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is based on the number of steps until the first occurrence of a certain value. For example, in Example 3, the 6 is expanded for 4 steps until it hits a 5, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, there's a pattern where certain values are replaced with other values in a way that forms a block. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in the fourth row is expanded to the right, forming a block of 2s, and the 5s are kept. In Example 3, the 6 is expanded to the right, forming a block of 6s, and then the 5s are kept.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is to replace certain cells with a block of their value, extending to the right until a certain condition is met.\n\nBut what is the condition?\n\nMaybe the condition is that the next cell is a certain value. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is followed by 5s, and the 2 is expanded to the right until it hits a 5. In Example 3, the 6 is followed by 5s, and the 6 is expanded to the right until it hits a 5. But how to determine the number of steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is to the right until it hits a cell with a value that is not equal to the current cell's value. For example, in Example 3, the 6 is followed by 5, so the expansion is for 1 step (column 1). But the output has 4 steps. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the 6 is in column 1, and the output has 6s in columns 1-4. The input for that row has 6 in column 1, followed by 5s. So the 6 is expanded to the right for 4 steps. Why 4?\n\nMaybe it's the number of steps until the first occurrence of a 5. But in this case, the first occurrence is column 2. So the expansion is for 1 step. But the output has 4 steps.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the transformation as a series of steps. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 3 is expanded to the right, but the 2 in row 2 is replaced with 0. Maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell in the grid.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is in column 8, and the output is 0. But in row 3, the 2 is in column 3, and it is expanded. So maybe the transformation depends on the row number and column number.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that if the cell is a 2, it is expanded to the right if it is in a certain row. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 2 is in a row that is not expanded, but the 2 in row 3 is expanded.\n\nBut this is too arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to replace each cell with the minimum value in its row. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace each cell with the value of the first cell to the left that is higher than it. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace each cell with the value of the first cell to the right that is higher than it. But this is also a guess.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern from the examples. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see.\n\nBased on the earlier examples where the expansion is to the right when the next cell is higher, and the 6 in Example 3 is expanded to the right even though the next cell is lower, I think there must be another pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the 6 is in column 1, and the output has 6s in columns 1-4. The input for that row has 6 in column 1, followed by 5s. So the 6 is expanded to the right for 4 columns, which is the number of 5s in the input row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is to the right for a fixed number of steps, like 5 steps. But this is arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis, even though it doesn't fit all cases, and see if it can be implemented.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]\n    for i in range(15):\n        for j in range(15):\n            if j + 1 < 15:\n                next_val = grid[i][j+1]\n                if next_val > grid[i][j]:\n                    expand_length = next_val - 1\n                    for k in range(j, j + expand_length + 1):\n                        if k < 15:\n                            transformed[i][k] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle the case where the next_val is lower, like in Example 3. But perhaps in the test input, the pattern is different.\n\nBut according to the test input, let's see.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 1 0\nRow 2: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 3: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 4: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 1\nRow 5: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 6: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 7: 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 8: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3\nRow 9: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 10: 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 11: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 12: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nRow 13: 0 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 0\nRow 14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 3 0 0 0\n\nNow, according to the code, let's see what happens in row 7 (row index 7), which has 6 in column 1. The next cell is 5, which is lower. So the code would not expand. But in the output, the 6 is expanded to columns 1-4. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the examples, this is a valid case. So the code is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see. Perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it is a certain value, it is expanded to the right for a fixed number of steps, like 5 steps. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should replace cells with the value of the first cell to the right that is higher, and expand to the right until that cell.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the code that handles the examples where the next cell is higher, and see if it passes the examples.\n\nBut in Example 3, the code would not handle the 6 in column 1, because the next cell is 5, which is lower. So the code would not expand it. But in the output, it is expanded. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the code should expand when the next cell is lower. For example, if the next cell is lower, then expand to the right for a certain number of steps.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should expand to the right for a fixed number of steps, like 5 steps.\n\nBut this is arbitrary.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the code that handles the examples where the next cell is higher, and hope that it passes the test cases.\n\nBut this is not a correct solution, but it's the best I can do under the time constraints.\n"
